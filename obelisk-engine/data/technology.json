          "standfirst": "While Gemini 3 is still making waves, Google&#x27;s not taking the foot off the gas in terms of releasing new models.Yesterday, the company released FunctionGemma, a specialized 270-million parameter AI model designed to solve one of the most persistent bottlenecks in modern application development: reliability at the edge. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, FunctionGemma is engineered for a single, critical utility—translating natural language user commands into structured code that apps and devices can actually execute, all without connecting to the cloud.The release marks a significant strategic pivot for Google DeepMind and the Google AI Developers team. While the industry continues to chase trillion-parameter scale in the cloud, FunctionGemma is a bet on \"Small Language Models\" (SLMs) running locally on phones, browsers, and IoT devices. For AI engineers and enterprise builders, this model offers a new architectural primitive: a privacy-first \"router\" that can handle complex logic on-device with negligible latency.FunctionGemma is available immediately for download on Hugging Face and Kaggle. You can also see the model in action by downloading the Google AI Edge Gallery app on the Google Play Store.The Performance LeapAt its core, FunctionGemma addresses the \"execution gap\" in generative AI. Standard large language models (LLMs) are excellent at conversation but often struggle to reliably trigger software actions—especially on resource-constrained devices.According to Google’s internal \"Mobile Actions\" evaluation, a generic small model struggles with reliability, achieving only a 58% baseline accuracy for function calling tasks. However, once fine-tuned for this specific purpose, FunctionGemma’s accuracy jumped to 85%, creating a specialized model that can exhibit the same success rate as models many times its size.It allows the model to handle more than just simple on/off switches; it can parse complex arguments, such as identifying specific grid coordinates to drive game mechanics or detailed logic.The release includes more than just the model weights. Google is providing a full \"recipe\" for developers, including:The Model: A 270M parameter transformer trained on 6 trillion tokens.Training Data: A \"Mobile Actions\" dataset to help developers train their own agents.Ecosystem Support: Compatibility with Hugging Face Transformers, Keras, Unsloth, and NVIDIA NeMo libraries.Omar Sanseviero, Developer Experience Lead at Hugging Face, highlighted the versatility of the release on X (formerly Twitter), noting the model is \"designed to be specialized for your own tasks\" and can run in \"your phone, browser or other devices.\"This local-first approach offers three distinct advantages:Privacy: Personal data (like calendar entries or contacts) never leaves the device.Latency: Actions happen instantly without waiting for a server round-trip. The small size means the speed at which it processes input is significant, particularly with access to accelerators such as GPUs and NPUs.Cost: Developers don&#x27;t pay per-token API fees for simple interactions.For AI Builders: A New Pattern for Production WorkflowsFor enterprise developers and system architects, FunctionGemma suggests a move away from monolithic AI systems toward compound systems. Instead of routing every minor user request to a massive, expensive cloud model like GPT-4 or Gemini 1.5 Pro, builders can now deploy FunctionGemma as an intelligent \"traffic controller\" at the edge.Here is how AI builders should conceptualize using FunctionGemma in production:1. The \"Traffic Controller\" Architecture: In a production environment, FunctionGemma can act as the first line of defense. It sits on the user&#x27;s device, instantly handling common, high-frequency commands (navigation, media control, basic data entry). If a request requires deep reasoning or world knowledge, the model can identify that need and route the request to a larger cloud model. This hybrid approach drastically reduces cloud inference costs and latency. This enables use cases such as routing queries to the appropriate sub-agent.2. Deterministic Reliability over Creative Chaos: Enterprises rarely need their banking or calendar apps to be \"creative.\" They need them to be accurate. The jump to 85% accuracy confirms that specialization beats size. Fine-tuning this small model on domain-specific data (e.g., proprietary enterprise APIs) creates a highly reliable tool that behaves predictably—a requirement for production deployment.3. Privacy-First Compliance: For sectors like healthcare, finance, or secure enterprise ops, sending data to the cloud is often a compliance risk. Because FunctionGemma is efficient enough to run on-device (compatible with NVIDIA Jetson, mobile CPUs, and browser-based Transformers.js), sensitive data like PII or proprietary commands never has to leave the local network.Licensing: Open-ish With GuardrailsFunctionGemma is released under Google&#x27;s custom Gemma Terms of Use. For enterprise and commercial developers, this is a critical distinction from standard open-source licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0.While Google describes Gemma as an \"open model,\" it is not strictly \"Open Source\" by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) definition. The license allows for free commercial use, redistribution, and modification, but it includes specific Usage Restrictions. Developers are prohibited from using the model for restricted activities (such as generating hate speech or malware), and Google reserves the right to update these terms.For the vast majority of startups and developers, the license is permissive enough to build commercial products. However, teams building dual-use technologies or those requiring strict copyleft freedom should review the specific clauses regarding \"Harmful Use\" and attribution.",

This deal gives you two years of the Advanced plan (with a bonus of four free months) for only $101. When it isn't on sale, the same subscription would cost $392. Engadget's VPN guru, Sam Chapman, praised ExpressVPN's service. He described it as \"high-performing\" and having \"very few flaws.\" The service received high marks for its speeds, easy-to-use interface and global network availability. The only significant mark against it was its relatively high standard pricing. But with this holiday sale, that criticism is (temporarily) null and void. ExpressVPN recently switched to a multi-tier pricing structure. (That previously mentioned Advanced plan is the mid-range one.) There's a cheaper Basic plan that allows 10 simultaneous devices (compared to the Advanced plan's 12) and doesn't include perks like a password manager. You can also choose the highest-priced Pro plan. It allows for 14 simultaneous devices and adds several extras. You can compare plans on ExpressVPN's website. When buying a two-year plan, the Basic tier is available for $2.79 per month (78 percent off). The Advanced plan is $3.59 per month (74 percent off). And the Pro plan is $5.99 per month (70 percent off). All three include the bonus of four additional months, giving you 28 total.

          "standfirst": "The iPad, of course, isn't the only tablet computer out there — it wasn't even the first — but Apple's version redefined the category. In our opinion, it's the best tablet you can buy and these slates consistently earn high scores in our reviews. That doesn't mean you should have to pay full price for your next iPad. We are continually on the hunt for good deals on iPads (and other Apple gear while we're at it) and each week, we round them up right there.Current discounts include the iPad mini and the 11-inch iPad Pro, each for $100 off the list price. Beyond iPads, are a few other Apple deals are going around, such as the latest AirPods Pro 3 for the lowest price yet at $199 and certain colors of the Apple Watch Series 11 for $299. Here are the best Apple deals we found this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (M3, 11-inch) for $499 ($100 off): The iPad Air is the top overall pick in our guide to the best iPads. Yes, it’s pricier than the entry-level iPad (A16), but its faster chip, extra RAM, laminated and more color-rich display, better speakers and superior accessory support add up to a more pleasant experience in day-to-day use. This isn't the lowest price we've tracked — the price went as low as $450 just after Black Friday, but this is still $100 cheaper than buying directly from Apple. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $899 ($100 off): The latest iPad Pro is still more tablet than most people will ever need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. The device was only released in October, so this deal ties its lowest price to date. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&H. Best Apple deals Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): These are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband features for locating your things when they’re close by. Just attach them to your keys, wallet or bag with the right AirTag holder and keep track of everything in the Find My app. Apple AirPods 4 for $74 ($55 off): If you don't need active noise cancellation and hate the feeling of headphones that just into your ear canal, the standard AirPods 4 remain a good buy. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass as typical in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs along these lines and still offer the usual array of Apple-friendly features. This discount is only $5 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday. Also at Best Buy for $85 if that runs out of stock. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave the SE 3 a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $949 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal matches the all-time low, and other configurations are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,350 ($249 off): Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out in October, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. The new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade, which only adds to the Pro's known qualities: a sturdy build, excellent trackpad and speakser paired with an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart. It's $1,399 at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal on the base model with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $10 more than the best deal we've seen but $20 less than the config's typical street price. Apple MagSafe cable 25W for $24 ($15 off): With this puck, the iPhone 17 can wirelessly recharge at 25-watt speeds. You can also get those speeds with iPhone 16 handsets that have updated to the latest OS 26 version. Just note that you’ll need to plug it into at least a 30 watt adapter, which isn’t included. This is the lowest price we've tracked. Apple USB-C Magic Mouse for $68 ($11 off): This isn't a record-low price for Apple's popular mouse — it went for $60 in October. It's lightweight, supports multi-touch features including scroll and the battery life is fairly long — just note that the charging port is on the bottom so you can't use it while it refills. The discount only applies to the white model.

          "title": "Even Google and Replit struggle to deploy AI agents reliably — here's why",
          "standfirst": "2025 was supposed to be the year of the AI agent, right? Not quite, acknowledge Google Cloud and Replit — two big players in the AI agent space and partners in the \"vibe coding\" movement — at a recent VB Impact Series event.Even as they build out agentic tools themselves, leaders from the two companies say the capabilities aren’t quite there yet. This constrained reality comes down to struggles with legacy workflows, fragmented data, and immature governance models. Also, enterprises fundamentally misunderstand that agents aren’t like other technologies: They require a fundamental rethink and reworking of workflows and processes. When enterprises are building agents to automate work, “most of them are toy examples,” Amjad Masad, CEO and founder of Replit, said during the event. “They get excited, but when they start rolling it out, it&#x27;s not really working very well.”Building agents based on Replit’s own mistakesReliability and integration, rather than intelligence itself, are two primary barriers to AI agent success, Masad noted. Agents frequently fail when run for extended periods, accumulate errors, or lack access to clean, well-structured data. The problem with enterprise data is it’s messy — it’s structured, unstructured, and stored all over the place — and crawling it is a challenge. Added to that, there are many unwritten things that people do that are difficult to encode in agents, Masad said. “The idea that companies are just going to turn on agents and agents will replace workers or do workflow automations automatically, it&#x27;s just not the case today,” he said. “The tooling is not there.” Going beyond agents are computer use tools, which can take over a user’s workspace for basic tasks like web browsing. But these are still in their infancy and can be buggy, unreliable, and even dangerous, despite the accelerated hype. “The problem is computer use models are really bad right now,” Masad said. “They&#x27;re expensive, they&#x27;re slow, they&#x27;re making progress, but they&#x27;re only about a year old.” Replit is learning from its own blunder earlier this year, when its AI coder wiped a company&#x27;s entire code base in a test run. Masad conceded: “The tools were not mature enough,” noting that the company has since isolated development from production. Techniques such as testing-in-the-loop, verifiable execution, and development isolation are essential, he noted, even as they can be highly resource-intensive. Replit incorporated in-the-loop capabilities into version 3 of its agent, and Masad said that its next-gen agent can work autonomously for 200 minutes; some have run it for 20 hours. Still, he acknowledged that users have expressed frustration around lag times. When they put in a “hefty prompt,” they may have to wait 20 minutes or longer. Ideally, they’ve expressed that they want to be involved in more of a creative loop where they can enter numerous prompts, work on multiple tasks at once, and adjust the design as the agent is working. “The way to solve that is parallelism, to create multiple agent loops and have them work on these independent features while allowing you to do the creative work at the same time,” he said. Agents require a cultural shiftBeyond the technical perspective, there’s a cultural hurdle: Agents operate probabilistically, but traditional enterprises are structured around deterministic processes, noted Mike Clark, director of product development at Google Cloud. This creates a cultural and operational mismatch as LLMs steam in with all-new tools, orchestration frameworks and processes. “We don&#x27;t know how to think about agents,” Clark said. “We don&#x27;t know how to solve for what agents can do.”The companies doing it right are being driven by bottoms-up processes, he noted: no-code and low-code software and tool creation in the trenches funneling up to larger agents. As of yet, the deployments that are successful are narrow, carefully scoped and heavily supervised. “If I look at 2025 and this promise of it being the year of agents, it was the year a lot of folks spent building prototypes,” Clark said. “Now we’re in the middle of this huge scale phase.”How do you secure a pasture-less world?Another struggle is AI agent security, which also requires a rethink of traditional processes, Clark noted. Security perimeters have been drawn around everything — but that doesn’t work when agents need to be able to access many different resources to make the best decisions, said Clark. “It&#x27;s really changing our security models, changing our base level,” he said. “What does least privilege mean in a pasture-less defenseless world?”Ultimately, there must be a governance rethink on the part of the whole industry, and enterprises must align on a threat model around agents. Clark pointed out the disparity: “If you look at some of your governance processes, you&#x27;ll be very surprised that the origin of those processes was somebody on an IBM electric typewriter typing in triplicate and handing that to three people. That is not the world we live in today.”",

The mouse typically sells for $79, though today's sale only applies to the white model. It's rare for official Apple accessories to go on sale, and the USB-C Magic Mouse is pretty much a must-have for those working on desktop computers. It's also fairly handy when combined with a laptop, letting folks avoid the trackpad. As the name suggests, this mouse charges via USB-C. Apple stuck with replaceable AA batteries for way too long, so this change was much appreciated. A charge should power the mouse for around a month, a metric I find to be more-or-less accurate depending on usage. This is a good mouse, and a great option for Apple devotees, but it's not without its flaws. The biggest one is port placement. The USB-C port is underneath the mouse, rendering it unusable while charging. Bloomberg recently reported that a major redesign is coming for Apple's wireless mouse that should address that issue.

Use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout to get half off, so you'll pay just $50 for one year of access. Monarch Money was the runner-up in our guide to the best budgeting apps in 2025, and it was definitely a grower. Initially we found the experience of using the app to be needlessly complicated compared to some of its rivals, but get over that hurdle and it’s impressively fully-featured. There are plenty of customization options, a helpful “goals” feature and a thorough month-in-review recap that beats out similar features from some of its competitors. We also like how you can grant account access to others. Besides the steep learning curve, we also noted that the mobile app is less intuitive to use than the web version, which might pose a problem if you were hoping to do most of your accounting on the go. We also had some issues with the app failing to distinguish between bills and other recurring expenses, as well as a few bugs along the way. All things considered, Monarch is definitely one of our favorite budgeting apps, only being beaten out by Quicken Simplifi. As you might expect, the biggest strength of Simplifi is its simplicity, and how it eases you into using its various features.

          "standfirst": "From indies like Silksong, to AAAs like Ghost of Yotei, and everything in between, 2025 truly had it all, and is likely to go down in the history books as one of the best years in gaming. But these are the games that felt truly special to the Engadget team. Arc Raiders I’m genuinely shocked by how much I love ARC Raiders. I’ve never been very interested in the whole PvE (Player vs. Environment) genre, aside from some brief stints with Destiny, but ARC Raiders's sci-fi post-apocalyptic vibe just works for me. I love the Blade Runner/anime-like aesthetic of its environments, enemies and outfits. I’m a sucker for its synthy soundtrack and immersive soundscape. And somehow, I’ve just fallen for the game’s loop, which involves running out for resources and missions, and hopefully making it back home safe. Sure, I’ve had a few runs where I’ve lost all my gear, thanks to random online jerks. But even those setbacks kept me motivated to play. You can always head out into the world with free gear, so if you fail, all you really lose is a bit of time. ARC Raiders reminds me of playing Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast decades ago, an early multiplayer experience that’s genuinely been hard for me to replicate since then. I sometimes explore maps just to soak up their architecture and environmental sounds. Sometimes I jump in to help other players, especially when they’re being harassed by others. Through success or failure, I can’t wait to head back in. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor AvowedObsidian kicked off 2025 with a bang, introducing a fresh and deeply engaging fantasy RPG universe in Avowed. It’s an expertly crafted and narratively rich adventure through mystical lands blighted by a mysterious fungus, set against a backdrop of political scheming, spiritual manipulation, colonization and resistance. The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant. Avowed is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.— Jessica Conditt, Senior ReporterBaby StepsBaby Steps is a true walking simulator: Your left trigger controls your left leg, and your right trigger controls your right. At first, you'll be stumbling and comically falling every few paces, and it’s easy to write the game off as some sort of Octodad affair, where half the fun is dealing with the jank of basic navigation. But before long, you’ll find the rhythm and confidently pace through the game’s open world.Of course, the challenge ramps up with your skill. Baby Steps has incredibly tight mechanics and a rewarding if punishing difficulty curve. Various surfaces and steeper inclines are introduced, and the game ends with a truly horrific mountain pass. Through it all, you’ll be treated to a light but touching story full of comedic improvisation from the game’s developers, who voice most of the characters themselves.— Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBall X PitI don’t usually go in for roguelike-style games, but my colleague Kris Holt convinced me to try Ball X Pit and, in doing so, ruined my autumn. This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. The base gameplay is rooted in classic Brick Breaker-style games from the ‘80s. Balls bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen, but instead of hitting and breaking bricks you’re bouncing them off a massive series of demonic enemies. There are eight levels and over a dozen different playable characters, each with their own distinct strengths and play styles, and the vast combination of upgrades you can unlock means no run will ever be quite the same. Perhaps the most fun thing about it is unlocking the different fusions and evolutions you can find along the way. Beyond the basic balls that your character shoots, you have slots for special balls that do things like freeze enemies, deal extra damage or blind enemies so they can’t accurately attack you. You can combine those special balls into even more powerful weapons, and finding the best evolutions that work with each character and each level adds yet another layer to the madness. While you can easily pick it up and play for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve found it pretty difficult to end a session without whiling away multiple hours. Think carefully about whether you’re ready to ruin your productivity for a few weeks (or months) before you dive into Ball X Pit.— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy EditorBlue PrinceMy absolute favorite experience in all of gaming is when I'm several hours into a puzzle game and I discover there's more going on than meets the eye. It's the moment where I realize an already-good game is in fact an excellent one, and I want to simultaneously curse the creators' evil brains and applaud their brilliance. I feel fortunate if I have that reaction once during a playthrough. Blue Prince provided me with that experience of total delight many times over. The biggest downside to a game like Blue Prince is that it's hard to talk about. For starters, it defies categorization. Sure, there are some roguelike elements and obviously plenty of puzzles, but playing it goes beyond a single genre tag. And more importantly, the journey of uncovering its surprises is a big reason why this game is so special. If you haven't tried it yet, I strongly suggest you do so and that you read as little about it as possible before diving in. All you need to know is that if you enjoy burrowing ever deeper into a rabbit hole of mysteries and problem-solving, you must play this game. Blue Prince is a real masterpiece by creative lead Tonda Ros and the whole Dogubomb team. It earns all the hype it gets.— Anna Washenko, Contributing ReporterCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward VectorNo game I played this year has stuck with me the way Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector did. At a time when it feels like our governments are failing us and corporate greed is destroying the world, Citizen Sleeper 2 tells a critical story about finding hope and purpose in the people and communities around you. And as great as the original Citizen Sleeper was, the new one is an even better game, with more polished systems that do a great job of reinforcing its narrative themes. There's a good chance many of you missed Citizen Sleeper 2, seeing as it arrived at the start of the year, but if you're feeling down about the state of the world, I can't recommend it enough. It will change your perspective.— Igor Bonifacic, Senior ReporterClair Obscur: Expedition 33Clair Obscur made a striking impression when we first glimpsed it in 2024, with its French dark fantasy aesthetic, its wild concept of a god-like Paintress and a turn-based combat system that seemed uniquely cinematic. It instantly became my most anticipated game of 2025. Thankfully, the game itself lived up to my expectations, with a thrilling story, memorable characters and some of the most beautiful visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Sure, its twists and turns might not feel entirely surprising if you’re an RPG connoisseur, but no other game captures such a specific vibe. It may not fully stick the landing, but Clair Obscur was certainly one of the most fulfilling narrative experiences I experienced this year. — D.H.Date Everything!This dating sim is witty as heck. That's the first reason I loved Date Everything. The writing is equal parts sharp and sensitive, silly and sincere, with a dose of pointed social commentary in between bouts of flirtation with anthropomorphized household items. Even the artwork is witty, transforming everything from a toaster to a treadmill into attractive humans in wildly clever and creative ways. The second and most important reason I loved this game is that Date Everything is a cavalcade of virtuoso voice acting that must be heard to be appreciated. I've played a bunch of visual novels without voiceover where the writing alone wasn't strong enough to make the characters pop, as well as voiced ones where middling performances detracted from the story. Date Everything's cast of 100 of the best in the business make their dialogue shine (and like I said, the dialogue is really damn good). There are some endearingly obvious casting choices. The horny clothes dryer? Yeah, it's Neil Newbon, who probably charmed your pants off as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3. Your D&D dice set? It couldn't be anyone but Matt Mercer. On the flip side, Cherami Lee as perky Chairemi (yep, your chairs) was unrecognizable from her stellar turn as V in Cyberpunk 2077. Laura Bailey has voiced countless heroines over the years, so the last place I expected to hear her was screaming her lungs out as one half of the toxic relationship playing out in your laundry room. Whether you're looking for love or laughs, Date Everything is a marvelous showcase of talents that often go underappreciated in gaming. — A.W.DespeloteHaving grown up with grandparents from South America, I'm familiar with a flavor of soccer fanaticism that hasn't quite taken root in the US. What makes Despelote so moving to play in 2025 is how it makes that sports fandom universal. The semi-autobiographical game lets you play your way through narrative vignettes, rendered in a stunning mix of filtered, photorealistic backgrounds and almost comics-inspired characters, primarily with a soccer ball at your feet. There's more to the game than kicking, however.Despelote asks players to walk, run and kick through the life of the game's lead developer Julian Cordero as he recounts his memories of Ecuador's historic attempt to win the World Cup. It's a personal history and national one, and by the end of the game, not quite what it seems. To put it another way: Despelote is melancholy, humorous and quite possibly the first game to capture what soccer means rather just than what it feels like to play.— Ian Carlos Campbell, Contributing ReporterDispatchIf you miss the heyday of Telltale's multiple choice narratives, like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and you aren't tired of superheroes yet, you'll love Dispatch. Developed by AdHoc Studio, which was formed by former Telltale alum, it's essentially a workplace dramedy for superheroes. But the mechanics don't matter as much as the characters, who are all uniquely intriguing, sad and hilarious. You play as Robert Robertson III, AKA Mecha Man, a former Iron Man-esque hero who can no longer fight crime on his own. He decides to manage a group of former villains for SDN (the Superhero Dispatch Network), hoping to imbue them with his own ideals of heroism. By day, you assign them to deal with crimes around Los Angeles, but through conversations and crucial Telltale decisions, you also encourage them to work as a team and hopefully become better people (or mutants). Buoyed by strong voice acting (including actors like Aaron Paul as the lead, and Jeffrey Wright in a hilarious supporting role), AdHoc's sharp writing, and excellent animation, Dispatch is a reminder of just how powerful adventure games can be. — D.H.Donkey Kong BananzaThe Switch 2 had a decent enough first year, but there's only one true killer app so far in my mind. Donkey Kong Bananza is the primary reason to pony up for Nintendo's new console. It's a 3D platforming classic up there with any Mario game, which makes sense given that the team behind Super Mario Odyssey made this one. It actually reinvents the formula by adding wanton destruction into the mix. Donkey Kong can destroy just about everything in the game and that's not hyperbole. You can literally spend hours absolutely pummelling entire game worlds into dust. This isn't just a stress reliever, as it leads to new kinds of puzzles and platforming ideas. As a bonus, DK is joined by a young Pauline, making this the cutest riff on The Last of Us ever. — Lawrence Bonk, Contributing ReporterFast FusionFast Fusion is a sci-fi arcade racer that wants little more than to bring the old Wipeout and 3D F-Zero games into modern times. Those games ruled. So does this one. As the name implies, it is seriously fast, and it commits to enhancing that sense of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled, anti-grav ships. Their engines wheeze. The backgrounds blur. Each course is littered with boost pads, and there’s a boost meter you can keep persistently charged by taking turns just right. Because this is what some may call a “video game-ass video game,” you can also make your ship jump, skipping entire turns or launching into a fiery wreck in equal measure. The courses here aren’t as thematically consistent as those in Mario Kart World. One minute you’re dashing through an Endor-style forest, the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a rainy highway. There are no cute mascots, either. But the tracks are spectacles, and they always give room to keep up your pace. When there is an obstacle to dodge, you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of threading the needle. In a year unusually loaded with high-profile arcade racers, few are better than Fast Fusion at keeping you engaged. It makes blinking feel risky. — Jeff Dunn, Senior ReporterGhost of YōteiSucker Punch Productions' return to a feudal Japan setting is another triumph for the studio. In Ghost of Yōtei, the developer crafted a world that I happily got lost in for hours, doing everything and anything but the main story missions until I absolutely had to. There was something to do around almost every corner and some of the game's many secrets were well-hidden. That's not to say the game's plot is anything to sniff at: this is a brutal tale of revenge, featuring rich writing and performances. The open-world format is a little at odds with protagonist Atsu’s steely desire for vengeance, but Ghost of Yōtei is beautifully orchestrated enough for that to be a minor complaint. The combat is stellar — to be most effective, you’ll need to swap between weapons to counter what your current opponent is wielding. Still, I couldn’t help but use the kusarigama whenever possible, especially to carry out stealthy assassinations from a distance. Strengthening Atsu’s bond with a wild wolf that becomes an ally in combat is also a highlight, while the deeply customizable difficulty settings are very welcome.Like its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, this is a technical masterpiece. Sucker Punch created another lush game that will surely be the source of countless desktop backgrounds. Blood-stained snow has rarely looked this good, especially if you enable the Miike Mode (named after director Takashi Miike and his gory films) to really paint the landscape red.— Kris Holt, Contributing ReporterHades 2The first thing to know about Hades II is that it's more Hades. It's the standard roguelite RNG grindfest, but with charm and enough detail-oriented flourishes to disguise what is essentially cranking the arm on a slot machine. The second thing to know is that you are no longer Zagreus, but Melinoë, princess of the underworld, and if you are a gay woman this game exists to roast you mercilessly. Zag was a lovable himbo engaged in a petty dispute against his father and free to romance a variety of Greek gods along the way. By contrast the world around Mel is coming apart at the seams, and her dating options are considerably less satisfying. Several of her in-game relationships with women are written to be warm and reciprocal, but of course they're with the found family of deities who support her. Nemesis and Eris, her two options for romance, seem to actively hate her and, after dozens of runs, are never interested in anything beyond a threadbare situationship. Juggling two different mission paths with their own distinct enemies and biomes is a treat — as are the new, sometimes brutally hard bosses. If only the rest didn't so closely resemble the indignities of dating in your 30s. — Avery Ellis, Deputy EditorIs This Seat Taken?Every incurable people pleaser has been told, at some point in their life, “you can’t make everyone happy.” Perhaps not in life. But in the sweetly cozy, zero-pressure, logic-puzzle indie game Is This Seat Taken? making people happy is not only possible, it’s the entire point. The game is set in a line-drawn, sepia-toned Barcelona and other cities. You act as a set of pinching fingers that lifts and places shape-people in their preferred seats — on the bus, in a restaurant, at a movie theater and so on. Each person has preferences (window seat, no bad smells, wants to read) and attributes (forgot to shower, plays loud music) that mesh or conflict.Tiny accessories and icons not only make each shape more adorable, they help keep track of some of their proclivities. Bubbly smiles or heartbreaking frowns tell you whether you’ve met a seated shape’s needs, and tapping on them tells you exactly what they want. A simple story involving a few of the shapes and an indie film takes form as you advance levels, but for the most part, you’re just checking in on what people want and arranging them to optimize happiness. I obsessively plowed through the game, soothed by the strummy music, delighted by the plops, bloops and chatters of the sound effects. As more people get on the bus (show up to the coworking space, arrive at the restaurant) it gets increasingly tougher to satisfy everyone — more than once I had to clear everyone off the train and start from scratch — but achieving 100 percent contentment is always possible. And if that’s not true IRL, then at least it is here. — Amy Skorheim, Senior ReporterKeeperKeeper is a surprisingly quiet and soul-soothing experience from Double Fine Productions, a studio best known for sassy, cartoon-style games like Costume Quest, Psychonauts and Brütal Legend. Keeper is a gorgeous and dialogue-free adventure through fantastical lands of deep shadows and vivid pastels, presented in a claymation-like art style that’s a joy to interact with. The game follows a sentient, walking lighthouse and its bird companion as they attempt to reach a mountaintop and cleanse the land of a nasty parasitic presence. Keeper only lasts about four hours tops, but its striking visuals, smooth mechanics and heartwarming story leave a lasting impression.— J.C.Kingdom Come: Deliverance IIKingdom Come: Deliverance II is a modern-day Morrowind. I mean that as a compliment. It's a game built on a series of complex, interlocking systems that work together to create one of the most immersive worlds I've had a chance to experience in recent years. As I guided my version of Henry of Skalitz through Warhorse Studios' beautiful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, I spent dozens of hours doing mundane things like blacksmithing, playing dice, foraging for herbs and concocting potions. Each of these activities feels like it could be a game on its own, and they work together to create an experience that feels refreshingly old-school. No one is making RPGs like Warhorse anymore — not even Bethesda — and that's what makes this game feel so special. It's the kind of experience studios used to make when games didn't need to appeal to everyone to recoup their development costs. — I.B.Look OutsideMonths after its release, Look Outside is still the game I can't shut up about, and it probably will continue to be for the foreseeable future. In Look Outside, your character wakes up to discover that an apocalyptic event has taken place, and anyone who looks outside to observe it is transformed into some sort of abomination. You have to survive two weeks inside your apartment building, gathering resources and, if you're trusting, accumulating allies to fight by your side. There are monsters everywhere, and their designs are wildly creative. It's a joy encountering all of the freakish creatures for the first time.There are tons of choices to make in Look Outside that will affect the course of your playthrough, and there are both moments of gut-wrenching bleakness and sheer absurdity. It's in a league of its own, blending a multitude of horrors — survival horror, cosmic horror, body horror, psychological horror — and captivating artwork (not to mention an S-tier soundtrack) into a gripping RPG that has enough substance to justify playing it again and again. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorLonely Mountains: Snow RidersMost games involving mountains are about a heroic climb. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is about a series of humbling descents. This is a physics-driven downhill skiing game that, like its predecessor, starts you at the top of various summits and tasks you with racing to the goal in one piece. The way down is filled with interweaving routes and shortcuts, but there are no directional markers to guide you. Nor is there any music to pump you up, just the sounds of skis cutting into powder, winds whipping, birds chirping, nature being nature. The result is a game that pits you against yourself. You rush down to beat a target time, but you’re always fighting gravity and cold, hard earth. So you crash, again and again, until you manage to survive that one clean run. The mountain becomes something to respect, not conquer. It’s fast, thrilling and total slapstick: Steering your low-poly, literally blockheaded avatar into a tree or off a cliff is always good for a laugh. (Seeing others do it in multiplayer is even better.) It’s also gorgeous, all glistening snow, intimate sounds and serene vistas. More than an enjoyably tense sports game, Snow Riders is a vivid expression of our relationship with nature. Think of it like a more contemplative SSX. — J.D.Metroid Prime 4: BeyondMetroid Prime 4: Beyond is not a perfect game. The story barely hangs together at times, the addition of a squad of companions can really disrupt the atmospheric isolation the series is known for, there are a few unfair difficulty ramps and the open-world desert is a bit of a slog. And yet, it also does so many things right. As with most Metroid games, there are varying biomes to explore, each with a distinct identity and various flora and fauna that do not like intruders. As with most Nintendo games, the design of these levels are excellent across the board, with clever challenges and puzzles that reward continued exploration.But for me, seeing a Metroid Prime game in 4K was worth the price of admission alone. Beyond doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it presents an absolutely gorgeous and immersive spectacle the likes of which we haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. Given that Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out in 2007 on the Wii, a console that maxed out at 480p, seeing the series’ impeccable art style brought to life on modern hardware was a delight. It may have some issues, but Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still worth experiencing.— N.I.Ninja Gaiden RageboundI'd somehow never played a single Ninja Gaiden game until this year, but I could hardly have had a better introduction to the series. The Game Kitchen's Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is an old-school, hack-and-slash platformer with top-notch pixel art, an excellent score and slick level design.The combat helps ensure that everything hangs together. Dual protagonists Kinji Monzu and Kumori (whose souls fuse together) have distinct abilities that work in harmony, and using the right tools to tackle each enemy helps charge up a powerful hyper attack. Ragebound isn't necessarily easy, but it isn't frustrating either — unless you're trying to put it down and do something else, because this is a very absorbing, entertaining game.— K.H. PeakPeak perfectly captures the delightful, simultaneous disasters that can happen when multiple people make stupid decisions at the same time. Ostensibly a multiplayer game about child scouts who crash land on a deserted island and are forced to climb to the top of a mountain to get rescued, Peak's multitude of dangerous biomes, status-affecting consumables and hidden secrets make it fun to get you and your friends killed. The game is an awkward first-person platformer where it's sometimes easier to shoot someone out of a cannon than it is to get them to toddle up a hill, but those obstacles feel good to overcome because the game lets you talk to people while you do it. The term \"friendslop\" was coined following the popularity of Peak and games like it, a burgeoning micro-genre where games with deceptively simple virtual tasks are paired with proximity-based voice chat. Unsurprisingly, it's fun to play video games with your friends, but Peak stands out because the ongoing support of developers Aggro Crab and Landfall has managed to keep things interesting in the game for nearly half the year.— I.C.C.Oblivion RemasterThere's a comfort in knowing exactly what you're going to get from a game. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered delivers all the things I love about Bethesda creations. It's a world I want to get lost in, where the detours are the true point of the journey. I become a stealth archer cat person who can cause chaos or save the day. And I can enjoy the studio's signature open-world RPG experience without suffering through the wonky design ideas that made the original game frustrating. For Bethesda fans, this remaster is a joy whether it's your first time playing Oblivion or your fiftieth.— A.W.ÖooI have a deep appreciation for games that give you a limited set of tools and many ways to use them. Puzzle-platformer Öoo is a brilliantly constructed example of that. It's so thoughtfully crafted that even the name is perfect. The large Ö looks like the caterpillar character you control and the smaller characters resemble the two bombs that you drag around and use to solve a variety of conundrums. Öoo is also the noise I involuntarily made when I solved some of the puzzles.Nama Takahashi (who made Öoo with help from Tiny Cactus Studio and Tsuyomi) uses deeply clever level design to teach you how to use the bombs and move forward. Takahashi clearly wants you to succeed. Checkpoints are everywhere, so if you die while trying to find a puzzle solution, there's no lengthy runback to worry about. The developer (who previously created ElecHead) even made his own walkthrough video to help you get to the end.Öoo — which you can complete in a single sitting — respects your time. It looks and sounds wonderful too. The music reminds me a lot of the outstanding Poinpy. While I remain sad that it's not currently possible to play that game, I'm more than happy to have Öoo to return to.— K.H.SilksongIt’s such a relief to know that, finally, this is probably the last time I’ll write about Silksong. (Oh no, more is coming.) Seven years in the making, from DLC to standalone game to Reddit meme, Silksong arrived across pretty much every mainstream gaming platform. The Hollow Knight sequel swaps to a new protagonist, Hornet, who was a recurring boss in the original. She’s faster, she can attack in diagonal dives, and just plays pretty differently from the Knight. Off the back of the slowburn hit of Hollow Knight, Team Cherry have lavished more attention, more fun and more diverse boss battles, ensuring this feels like a better (although possibly more challenging) game. I prefer the faster, risk-and-reward playstyle too. Hornet uses silk to heal, which, like soul in Hollow Knight, you build up by attacking enemies. However, Hornet does this in bulk, healing three hearts at once. When you die, you’ll leave a bounty of silk behind, making for a tempting health top-up you can grab mid-boss fight. If you don’t die before then. You can equip Hornet with different weapon and subweapon loadouts, adding a little more variety in this sequel. Heavy, slower weapon swings, or relentless strikes with a much shorter range? Your choice.When it launched, half the Engadget team were sharing tales of bottlenecks and seemingly impossible boss fights, and we were all exploring the world of Silksong in entirely different directions. That’s the blessing and the curse of a Hollow Knight game. — Mat Smith, UK Bureau ChiefSilent Hill fIt’s a rare and special thing when a horror game lives up to the gruesome promises of its cinematic teaser trailer, and Silent Hill f accomplishes this and more. Silent Hill f is a heart-pounding survival-horror game set in a rural Japanese village in the 1960s and starring Hinako, a high school student with crappy friends and a tormented home life. Hinako’s town is ravaged by demonic creatures and an infectious botanical fungus, and she has to fight her way through it, shifting among realities and encountering a cast of untrustworthy peers and fox worshippers. The combat starts out great and only gets better as Hinako sacrifices her flesh in the name of salvation, meaning the body horror steadily ramps up as the game progresses. Hinako’s world is filled with terrifying mannequin minions, bulbous pus monsters and disturbing, trypophobic visuals. It’s beautiful.— J.C.Subway BuilderSubway BuilderAaron SouppourisSubway Builder is an indie transport sim like no other. Creator Colin Miller combined OpenStreet maps of large cities with government data about where people live and work. This creates a complex web of nodes representing residents and workplaces for you to connect. You’ll start with no public transport infrastructure and try to build out a profitable network. In dense cities like New York this is incredibly easy, but freeing even 20 percent of Phoenix's endless sprawl from cars without going bust is very challenging. The game scratches the same itch for me as Mini Metro, only instead of cutesy vector graphics you're basically working in Google Maps. It's also expanding at a rapid pace: When I first played in October, there were maybe 15 locations, and as of writing there are now 29 US cities and, most recently, five UK options. I spent the first 35 years of my life bouncing around Croydon and Lewisham in London; giving South Londoners a proper tube network (while ignoring anything north of Highbury) has been a real treat.— A.S. Sword of the SeaWhile the game might always be evoked in the same breath as Journey, the PlayStation classic with which it shares a key creative, Sword of the Sea is more than just another beautiful trek towards a mountain. Combining delectable traversal mechanics from The Pathless and beautiful sea creatures like those in Abzu, the game is a culmination of everything developer Giant Squid is good at. More importantly, though, Sword of the Sea's surfing mechanic just looks and feels damn cool.I don't know that I ever mastered how to surf on a sword during Sword of the Sea's silent and surprisingly brief narrative, but I do know it didn't take long to care. Carving through sand and snow immediately came easy enough that getting to any of the game's intriguing landmarks and collectibles was a matter of how, not if. That's not to discredit the game's other charms, like a score from Austin Wintory and a photo mode that's perfect for capturing close encounters with dolphins, whales and sharks. If you need a reason to play Sword of the Sea, though, let it be the surfing. It tells you more about the game and what it wants you to feel than any piece of dialogue could.— I.C.C. Sworn Let's get one thing out of the way. Yes, Sworn is a Hades clone, but it's a darned good one. This game swaps out the Olympian gods for characters sourced from Arthurian legend, but the nuts and bolts gameplay is pretty much the same. So why was this one of my favorite games in a year when Hades 2 set the world on fire? The combat is extremely addictive and there are multiple character classes that truly change how everything plays. Some characters are for up close combat and others are better at dropping turrets and related items that do damage over time. It's super fun to litter a bunch of poison-soaked cannons in a level and just let them do their thing. It also has four-player co-op, which is chaotic in all the best ways. The story is totally forgettable when compared to Hades, but that's not why I play roguelites. — L.B.

          "content": "From indies like Silksong, to AAAs like Ghost of Yotei, and everything in between, 2025 truly had it all, and is likely to go down in the history books as one of the best years in gaming. But these are the games that felt truly special to the Engadget team. Arc Raiders I’m genuinely shocked by how much I love ARC Raiders. I’ve never been very interested in the whole PvE (Player vs. Environment) genre, aside from some brief stints with Destiny, but ARC Raiders's sci-fi post-apocalyptic vibe just works for me. I love the Blade Runner/anime-like aesthetic of its environments, enemies and outfits. I’m a sucker for its synthy soundtrack and immersive soundscape. And somehow, I’ve just fallen for the game’s loop, which involves running out for resources and missions, and hopefully making it back home safe. Sure, I’ve had a few runs where I’ve lost all my gear, thanks to random online jerks. But even those setbacks kept me motivated to play. You can always head out into the world with free gear, so if you fail, all you really lose is a bit of time. ARC Raiders reminds me of playing Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast decades ago, an early multiplayer experience that’s genuinely been hard for me to replicate since then. I sometimes explore maps just to soak up their architecture and environmental sounds. Sometimes I jump in to help other players, especially when they’re being harassed by others. Through success or failure, I can’t wait to head back in. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor AvowedObsidian kicked off 2025 with a bang, introducing a fresh and deeply engaging fantasy RPG universe in Avowed. It’s an expertly crafted and narratively rich adventure through mystical lands blighted by a mysterious fungus, set against a backdrop of political scheming, spiritual manipulation, colonization and resistance. The writing is stellar throughout, though the sidequests that reveal your companions’ backstories are particularly poignant. Avowed is gorgeous, its combat systems are fully customizable, its characters are intriguing and its encumbrance limit is generous. There’s a real sense of magic about the entire game — and no, that’s not just the mind-altering mushrooms talking.— Jessica Conditt, Senior ReporterBaby StepsBaby Steps is a true walking simulator: Your left trigger controls your left leg, and your right trigger controls your right. At first, you'll be stumbling and comically falling every few paces, and it’s easy to write the game off as some sort of Octodad affair, where half the fun is dealing with the jank of basic navigation. But before long, you’ll find the rhythm and confidently pace through the game’s open world.Of course, the challenge ramps up with your skill. Baby Steps has incredibly tight mechanics and a rewarding if punishing difficulty curve. Various surfaces and steeper inclines are introduced, and the game ends with a truly horrific mountain pass. Through it all, you’ll be treated to a light but touching story full of comedic improvisation from the game’s developers, who voice most of the characters themselves.— Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBall X PitI don’t usually go in for roguelike-style games, but my colleague Kris Holt convinced me to try Ball X Pit and, in doing so, ruined my autumn. This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. The base gameplay is rooted in classic Brick Breaker-style games from the ‘80s. Balls bounce from the bottom to the top of the screen, but instead of hitting and breaking bricks you’re bouncing them off a massive series of demonic enemies. There are eight levels and over a dozen different playable characters, each with their own distinct strengths and play styles, and the vast combination of upgrades you can unlock means no run will ever be quite the same. Perhaps the most fun thing about it is unlocking the different fusions and evolutions you can find along the way. Beyond the basic balls that your character shoots, you have slots for special balls that do things like freeze enemies, deal extra damage or blind enemies so they can’t accurately attack you. You can combine those special balls into even more powerful weapons, and finding the best evolutions that work with each character and each level adds yet another layer to the madness. While you can easily pick it up and play for 20 or 30 minutes, I’ve found it pretty difficult to end a session without whiling away multiple hours. Think carefully about whether you’re ready to ruin your productivity for a few weeks (or months) before you dive into Ball X Pit.— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy EditorBlue PrinceMy absolute favorite experience in all of gaming is when I'm several hours into a puzzle game and I discover there's more going on than meets the eye. It's the moment where I realize an already-good game is in fact an excellent one, and I want to simultaneously curse the creators' evil brains and applaud their brilliance. I feel fortunate if I have that reaction once during a playthrough. Blue Prince provided me with that experience of total delight many times over. The biggest downside to a game like Blue Prince is that it's hard to talk about. For starters, it defies categorization. Sure, there are some roguelike elements and obviously plenty of puzzles, but playing it goes beyond a single genre tag. And more importantly, the journey of uncovering its surprises is a big reason why this game is so special. If you haven't tried it yet, I strongly suggest you do so and that you read as little about it as possible before diving in. All you need to know is that if you enjoy burrowing ever deeper into a rabbit hole of mysteries and problem-solving, you must play this game. Blue Prince is a real masterpiece by creative lead Tonda Ros and the whole Dogubomb team. It earns all the hype it gets.— Anna Washenko, Contributing ReporterCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward VectorNo game I played this year has stuck with me the way Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector did. At a time when it feels like our governments are failing us and corporate greed is destroying the world, Citizen Sleeper 2 tells a critical story about finding hope and purpose in the people and communities around you. And as great as the original Citizen Sleeper was, the new one is an even better game, with more polished systems that do a great job of reinforcing its narrative themes. There's a good chance many of you missed Citizen Sleeper 2, seeing as it arrived at the start of the year, but if you're feeling down about the state of the world, I can't recommend it enough. It will change your perspective.— Igor Bonifacic, Senior ReporterClair Obscur: Expedition 33Clair Obscur made a striking impression when we first glimpsed it in 2024, with its French dark fantasy aesthetic, its wild concept of a god-like Paintress and a turn-based combat system that seemed uniquely cinematic. It instantly became my most anticipated game of 2025. Thankfully, the game itself lived up to my expectations, with a thrilling story, memorable characters and some of the most beautiful visuals I’ve ever seen in a game. Sure, its twists and turns might not feel entirely surprising if you’re an RPG connoisseur, but no other game captures such a specific vibe. It may not fully stick the landing, but Clair Obscur was certainly one of the most fulfilling narrative experiences I experienced this year. — D.H.Date Everything!This dating sim is witty as heck. That's the first reason I loved Date Everything. The writing is equal parts sharp and sensitive, silly and sincere, with a dose of pointed social commentary in between bouts of flirtation with anthropomorphized household items. Even the artwork is witty, transforming everything from a toaster to a treadmill into attractive humans in wildly clever and creative ways. The second and most important reason I loved this game is that Date Everything is a cavalcade of virtuoso voice acting that must be heard to be appreciated. I've played a bunch of visual novels without voiceover where the writing alone wasn't strong enough to make the characters pop, as well as voiced ones where middling performances detracted from the story. Date Everything's cast of 100 of the best in the business make their dialogue shine (and like I said, the dialogue is really damn good). There are some endearingly obvious casting choices. The horny clothes dryer? Yeah, it's Neil Newbon, who probably charmed your pants off as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3. Your D&D dice set? It couldn't be anyone but Matt Mercer. On the flip side, Cherami Lee as perky Chairemi (yep, your chairs) was unrecognizable from her stellar turn as V in Cyberpunk 2077. Laura Bailey has voiced countless heroines over the years, so the last place I expected to hear her was screaming her lungs out as one half of the toxic relationship playing out in your laundry room. Whether you're looking for love or laughs, Date Everything is a marvelous showcase of talents that often go underappreciated in gaming. — A.W.DespeloteHaving grown up with grandparents from South America, I'm familiar with a flavor of soccer fanaticism that hasn't quite taken root in the US. What makes Despelote so moving to play in 2025 is how it makes that sports fandom universal. The semi-autobiographical game lets you play your way through narrative vignettes, rendered in a stunning mix of filtered, photorealistic backgrounds and almost comics-inspired characters, primarily with a soccer ball at your feet. There's more to the game than kicking, however.Despelote asks players to walk, run and kick through the life of the game's lead developer Julian Cordero as he recounts his memories of Ecuador's historic attempt to win the World Cup. It's a personal history and national one, and by the end of the game, not quite what it seems. To put it another way: Despelote is melancholy, humorous and quite possibly the first game to capture what soccer means rather just than what it feels like to play.— Ian Carlos Campbell, Contributing ReporterDispatchIf you miss the heyday of Telltale's multiple choice narratives, like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and you aren't tired of superheroes yet, you'll love Dispatch. Developed by AdHoc Studio, which was formed by former Telltale alum, it's essentially a workplace dramedy for superheroes. But the mechanics don't matter as much as the characters, who are all uniquely intriguing, sad and hilarious. You play as Robert Robertson III, AKA Mecha Man, a former Iron Man-esque hero who can no longer fight crime on his own. He decides to manage a group of former villains for SDN (the Superhero Dispatch Network), hoping to imbue them with his own ideals of heroism. By day, you assign them to deal with crimes around Los Angeles, but through conversations and crucial Telltale decisions, you also encourage them to work as a team and hopefully become better people (or mutants). Buoyed by strong voice acting (including actors like Aaron Paul as the lead, and Jeffrey Wright in a hilarious supporting role), AdHoc's sharp writing, and excellent animation, Dispatch is a reminder of just how powerful adventure games can be. — D.H.Donkey Kong BananzaThe Switch 2 had a decent enough first year, but there's only one true killer app so far in my mind. Donkey Kong Bananza is the primary reason to pony up for Nintendo's new console. It's a 3D platforming classic up there with any Mario game, which makes sense given that the team behind Super Mario Odyssey made this one. It actually reinvents the formula by adding wanton destruction into the mix. Donkey Kong can destroy just about everything in the game and that's not hyperbole. You can literally spend hours absolutely pummelling entire game worlds into dust. This isn't just a stress reliever, as it leads to new kinds of puzzles and platforming ideas. As a bonus, DK is joined by a young Pauline, making this the cutest riff on The Last of Us ever. — Lawrence Bonk, Contributing ReporterFast FusionFast Fusion is a sci-fi arcade racer that wants little more than to bring the old Wipeout and 3D F-Zero games into modern times. Those games ruled. So does this one. As the name implies, it is seriously fast, and it commits to enhancing that sense of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled, anti-grav ships. Their engines wheeze. The backgrounds blur. Each course is littered with boost pads, and there’s a boost meter you can keep persistently charged by taking turns just right. Because this is what some may call a “video game-ass video game,” you can also make your ship jump, skipping entire turns or launching into a fiery wreck in equal measure. The courses here aren’t as thematically consistent as those in Mario Kart World. One minute you’re dashing through an Endor-style forest, the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a rainy highway. There are no cute mascots, either. But the tracks are spectacles, and they always give room to keep up your pace. When there is an obstacle to dodge, you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of threading the needle. In a year unusually loaded with high-profile arcade racers, few are better than Fast Fusion at keeping you engaged. It makes blinking feel risky. — Jeff Dunn, Senior ReporterGhost of YōteiSucker Punch Productions' return to a feudal Japan setting is another triumph for the studio. In Ghost of Yōtei, the developer crafted a world that I happily got lost in for hours, doing everything and anything but the main story missions until I absolutely had to. There was something to do around almost every corner and some of the game's many secrets were well-hidden. That's not to say the game's plot is anything to sniff at: this is a brutal tale of revenge, featuring rich writing and performances. The open-world format is a little at odds with protagonist Atsu’s steely desire for vengeance, but Ghost of Yōtei is beautifully orchestrated enough for that to be a minor complaint. The combat is stellar — to be most effective, you’ll need to swap between weapons to counter what your current opponent is wielding. Still, I couldn’t help but use the kusarigama whenever possible, especially to carry out stealthy assassinations from a distance. Strengthening Atsu’s bond with a wild wolf that becomes an ally in combat is also a highlight, while the deeply customizable difficulty settings are very welcome.Like its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, this is a technical masterpiece. Sucker Punch created another lush game that will surely be the source of countless desktop backgrounds. Blood-stained snow has rarely looked this good, especially if you enable the Miike Mode (named after director Takashi Miike and his gory films) to really paint the landscape red.— Kris Holt, Contributing ReporterHades 2The first thing to know about Hades II is that it's more Hades. It's the standard roguelite RNG grindfest, but with charm and enough detail-oriented flourishes to disguise what is essentially cranking the arm on a slot machine. The second thing to know is that you are no longer Zagreus, but Melinoë, princess of the underworld, and if you are a gay woman this game exists to roast you mercilessly. Zag was a lovable himbo engaged in a petty dispute against his father and free to romance a variety of Greek gods along the way. By contrast the world around Mel is coming apart at the seams, and her dating options are considerably less satisfying. Several of her in-game relationships with women are written to be warm and reciprocal, but of course they're with the found family of deities who support her. Nemesis and Eris, her two options for romance, seem to actively hate her and, after dozens of runs, are never interested in anything beyond a threadbare situationship. Juggling two different mission paths with their own distinct enemies and biomes is a treat — as are the new, sometimes brutally hard bosses. If only the rest didn't so closely resemble the indignities of dating in your 30s. — Avery Ellis, Deputy EditorIs This Seat Taken?Every incurable people pleaser has been told, at some point in their life, “you can’t make everyone happy.” Perhaps not in life. But in the sweetly cozy, zero-pressure, logic-puzzle indie game Is This Seat Taken? making people happy is not only possible, it’s the entire point. The game is set in a line-drawn, sepia-toned Barcelona and other cities. You act as a set of pinching fingers that lifts and places shape-people in their preferred seats — on the bus, in a restaurant, at a movie theater and so on. Each person has preferences (window seat, no bad smells, wants to read) and attributes (forgot to shower, plays loud music) that mesh or conflict.Tiny accessories and icons not only make each shape more adorable, they help keep track of some of their proclivities. Bubbly smiles or heartbreaking frowns tell you whether you’ve met a seated shape’s needs, and tapping on them tells you exactly what they want. A simple story involving a few of the shapes and an indie film takes form as you advance levels, but for the most part, you’re just checking in on what people want and arranging them to optimize happiness. I obsessively plowed through the game, soothed by the strummy music, delighted by the plops, bloops and chatters of the sound effects. As more people get on the bus (show up to the coworking space, arrive at the restaurant) it gets increasingly tougher to satisfy everyone — more than once I had to clear everyone off the train and start from scratch — but achieving 100 percent contentment is always possible. And if that’s not true IRL, then at least it is here. — Amy Skorheim, Senior ReporterKeeperKeeper is a surprisingly quiet and soul-soothing experience from Double Fine Productions, a studio best known for sassy, cartoon-style games like Costume Quest, Psychonauts and Brütal Legend. Keeper is a gorgeous and dialogue-free adventure through fantastical lands of deep shadows and vivid pastels, presented in a claymation-like art style that’s a joy to interact with. The game follows a sentient, walking lighthouse and its bird companion as they attempt to reach a mountaintop and cleanse the land of a nasty parasitic presence. Keeper only lasts about four hours tops, but its striking visuals, smooth mechanics and heartwarming story leave a lasting impression.— J.C.Kingdom Come: Deliverance IIKingdom Come: Deliverance II is a modern-day Morrowind. I mean that as a compliment. It's a game built on a series of complex, interlocking systems that work together to create one of the most immersive worlds I've had a chance to experience in recent years. As I guided my version of Henry of Skalitz through Warhorse Studios' beautiful recreation of 15th century Bohemia, I spent dozens of hours doing mundane things like blacksmithing, playing dice, foraging for herbs and concocting potions. Each of these activities feels like it could be a game on its own, and they work together to create an experience that feels refreshingly old-school. No one is making RPGs like Warhorse anymore — not even Bethesda — and that's what makes this game feel so special. It's the kind of experience studios used to make when games didn't need to appeal to everyone to recoup their development costs. — I.B.Look OutsideMonths after its release, Look Outside is still the game I can't shut up about, and it probably will continue to be for the foreseeable future. In Look Outside, your character wakes up to discover that an apocalyptic event has taken place, and anyone who looks outside to observe it is transformed into some sort of abomination. You have to survive two weeks inside your apartment building, gathering resources and, if you're trusting, accumulating allies to fight by your side. There are monsters everywhere, and their designs are wildly creative. It's a joy encountering all of the freakish creatures for the first time.There are tons of choices to make in Look Outside that will affect the course of your playthrough, and there are both moments of gut-wrenching bleakness and sheer absurdity. It's in a league of its own, blending a multitude of horrors — survival horror, cosmic horror, body horror, psychological horror — and captivating artwork (not to mention an S-tier soundtrack) into a gripping RPG that has enough substance to justify playing it again and again. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorLonely Mountains: Snow RidersMost games involving mountains are about a heroic climb. Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is about a series of humbling descents. This is a physics-driven downhill skiing game that, like its predecessor, starts you at the top of various summits and tasks you with racing to the goal in one piece. The way down is filled with interweaving routes and shortcuts, but there are no directional markers to guide you. Nor is there any music to pump you up, just the sounds of skis cutting into powder, winds whipping, birds chirping, nature being nature. The result is a game that pits you against yourself. You rush down to beat a target time, but you’re always fighting gravity and cold, hard earth. So you crash, again and again, until you manage to survive that one clean run. The mountain becomes something to respect, not conquer. It’s fast, thrilling and total slapstick: Steering your low-poly, literally blockheaded avatar into a tree or off a cliff is always good for a laugh. (Seeing others do it in multiplayer is even better.) It’s also gorgeous, all glistening snow, intimate sounds and serene vistas. More than an enjoyably tense sports game, Snow Riders is a vivid expression of our relationship with nature. Think of it like a more contemplative SSX. — J.D.Metroid Prime 4: BeyondMetroid Prime 4: Beyond is not a perfect game. The story barely hangs together at times, the addition of a squad of companions can really disrupt the atmospheric isolation the series is known for, there are a few unfair difficulty ramps and the open-world desert is a bit of a slog. And yet, it also does so many things right. As with most Metroid games, there are varying biomes to explore, each with a distinct identity and various flora and fauna that do not like intruders. As with most Nintendo games, the design of these levels are excellent across the board, with clever challenges and puzzles that reward continued exploration.But for me, seeing a Metroid Prime game in 4K was worth the price of admission alone. Beyond doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it presents an absolutely gorgeous and immersive spectacle the likes of which we haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. Given that Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out in 2007 on the Wii, a console that maxed out at 480p, seeing the series’ impeccable art style brought to life on modern hardware was a delight. It may have some issues, but Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still worth experiencing.— N.I.Ninja Gaiden RageboundI'd somehow never played a single Ninja Gaiden game until this year, but I could hardly have had a better introduction to the series. The Game Kitchen's Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is an old-school, hack-and-slash platformer with top-notch pixel art, an excellent score and slick level design.The combat helps ensure that everything hangs together. Dual protagonists Kinji Monzu and Kumori (whose souls fuse together) have distinct abilities that work in harmony, and using the right tools to tackle each enemy helps charge up a powerful hyper attack. Ragebound isn't necessarily easy, but it isn't frustrating either — unless you're trying to put it down and do something else, because this is a very absorbing, entertaining game.— K.H. PeakPeak perfectly captures the delightful, simultaneous disasters that can happen when multiple people make stupid decisions at the same time. Ostensibly a multiplayer game about child scouts who crash land on a deserted island and are forced to climb to the top of a mountain to get rescued, Peak's multitude of dangerous biomes, status-affecting consumables and hidden secrets make it fun to get you and your friends killed. The game is an awkward first-person platformer where it's sometimes easier to shoot someone out of a cannon than it is to get them to toddle up a hill, but those obstacles feel good to overcome because the game lets you talk to people while you do it. The term \"friendslop\" was coined following the popularity of Peak and games like it, a burgeoning micro-genre where games with deceptively simple virtual tasks are paired with proximity-based voice chat. Unsurprisingly, it's fun to play video games with your friends, but Peak stands out because the ongoing support of developers Aggro Crab and Landfall has managed to keep things interesting in the game for nearly half the year.— I.C.C.Oblivion RemasterThere's a comfort in knowing exactly what you're going to get from a game. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered delivers all the things I love about Bethesda creations. It's a world I want to get lost in, where the detours are the true point of the journey. I become a stealth archer cat person who can cause chaos or save the day. And I can enjoy the studio's signature open-world RPG experience without suffering through the wonky design ideas that made the original game frustrating. For Bethesda fans, this remaster is a joy whether it's your first time playing Oblivion or your fiftieth.— A.W.ÖooI have a deep appreciation for games that give you a limited set of tools and many ways to use them. Puzzle-platformer Öoo is a brilliantly constructed example of that. It's so thoughtfully crafted that even the name is perfect. The large Ö looks like the caterpillar character you control and the smaller characters resemble the two bombs that you drag around and use to solve a variety of conundrums. Öoo is also the noise I involuntarily made when I solved some of the puzzles.Nama Takahashi (who made Öoo with help from Tiny Cactus Studio and Tsuyomi) uses deeply clever level design to teach you how to use the bombs and move forward. Takahashi clearly wants you to succeed. Checkpoints are everywhere, so if you die while trying to find a puzzle solution, there's no lengthy runback to worry about. The developer (who previously created ElecHead) even made his own walkthrough video to help you get to the end.Öoo — which you can complete in a single sitting — respects your time. It looks and sounds wonderful too. The music reminds me a lot of the outstanding Poinpy. While I remain sad that it's not currently possible to play that game, I'm more than happy to have Öoo to return to.— K.H.SilksongIt’s such a relief to know that, finally, this is probably the last time I’ll write about Silksong. (Oh no, more is coming.) Seven years in the making, from DLC to standalone game to Reddit meme, Silksong arrived across pretty much every mainstream gaming platform. The Hollow Knight sequel swaps to a new protagonist, Hornet, who was a recurring boss in the original. She’s faster, she can attack in diagonal dives, and just plays pretty differently from the Knight. Off the back of the slowburn hit of Hollow Knight, Team Cherry have lavished more attention, more fun and more diverse boss battles, ensuring this feels like a better (although possibly more challenging) game. I prefer the faster, risk-and-reward playstyle too. Hornet uses silk to heal, which, like soul in Hollow Knight, you build up by attacking enemies. However, Hornet does this in bulk, healing three hearts at once. When you die, you’ll leave a bounty of silk behind, making for a tempting health top-up you can grab mid-boss fight. If you don’t die before then. You can equip Hornet with different weapon and subweapon loadouts, adding a little more variety in this sequel. Heavy, slower weapon swings, or relentless strikes with a much shorter range? Your choice.When it launched, half the Engadget team were sharing tales of bottlenecks and seemingly impossible boss fights, and we were all exploring the world of Silksong in entirely different directions. That’s the blessing and the curse of a Hollow Knight game. — Mat Smith, UK Bureau ChiefSilent Hill fIt’s a rare and special thing when a horror game lives up to the gruesome promises of its cinematic teaser trailer, and Silent Hill f accomplishes this and more. Silent Hill f is a heart-pounding survival-horror game set in a rural Japanese village in the 1960s and starring Hinako, a high school student with crappy friends and a tormented home life. Hinako’s town is ravaged by demonic creatures and an infectious botanical fungus, and she has to fight her way through it, shifting among realities and encountering a cast of untrustworthy peers and fox worshippers. The combat starts out great and only gets better as Hinako sacrifices her flesh in the name of salvation, meaning the body horror steadily ramps up as the game progresses. Hinako’s world is filled with terrifying mannequin minions, bulbous pus monsters and disturbing, trypophobic visuals. It’s beautiful.— J.C.Subway BuilderSubway BuilderAaron SouppourisSubway Builder is an indie transport sim like no other. Creator Colin Miller combined OpenStreet maps of large cities with government data about where people live and work. This creates a complex web of nodes representing residents and workplaces for you to connect. You’ll start with no public transport infrastructure and try to build out a profitable network. In dense cities like New York this is incredibly easy, but freeing even 20 percent of Phoenix's endless sprawl from cars without going bust is very challenging. The game scratches the same itch for me as Mini Metro, only instead of cutesy vector graphics you're basically working in Google Maps. It's also expanding at a rapid pace: When I first played in October, there were maybe 15 locations, and as of writing there are now 29 US cities and, most recently, five UK options. I spent the first 35 years of my life bouncing around Croydon and Lewisham in London; giving South Londoners a proper tube network (while ignoring anything north of Highbury) has been a real treat.— A.S. Sword of the SeaWhile the game might always be evoked in the same breath as Journey, the PlayStation classic with which it shares a key creative, Sword of the Sea is more than just another beautiful trek towards a mountain. Combining delectable traversal mechanics from The Pathless and beautiful sea creatures like those in Abzu, the game is a culmination of everything developer Giant Squid is good at. More importantly, though, Sword of the Sea's surfing mechanic just looks and feels damn cool.I don't know that I ever mastered how to surf on a sword during Sword of the Sea's silent and surprisingly brief narrative, but I do know it didn't take long to care. Carving through sand and snow immediately came easy enough that getting to any of the game's intriguing landmarks and collectibles was a matter of how, not if. That's not to discredit the game's other charms, like a score from Austin Wintory and a photo mode that's perfect for capturing close encounters with dolphins, whales and sharks. If you need a reason to play Sword of the Sea, though, let it be the surfing. It tells you more about the game and what it wants you to feel than any piece of dialogue could.— I.C.C. Sworn Let's get one thing out of the way. Yes, Sworn is a Hades clone, but it's a darned good one. This game swaps out the Olympian gods for characters sourced from Arthurian legend, but the nuts and bolts gameplay is pretty much the same. So why was this one of my favorite games in a year when Hades 2 set the world on fire? The combat is extremely addictive and there are multiple character classes that truly change how everything plays. Some characters are for up close combat and others are better at dropping turrets and related items that do damage over time. It's super fun to litter a bunch of poison-soaked cannons in a level and just let them do their thing. It also has four-player co-op, which is chaotic in all the best ways. The story is totally forgettable when compared to Hades, but that's not why I play roguelites. — L.B.

          "standfirst": "If you want to hear Apple Music’s lossless catalog the way it was meant to sound, you will need a little extra hardware. iPhones and most wireless headphones still have limitations when it comes to high-resolution audio, which means a good DAC can make a real difference in clarity and detail. Whether you listen through wired earbuds, studio headphones or a home speaker setup, the right DAC can bring out far more texture in your music.Lossless audio can be confusing at first, especially with different formats and file sizes to consider, but you do not need a complicated setup to enjoy it. Many DACs work across iOS, Android, Mac and Windows, and several are small enough to carry every day. In this guide, we picked the best DACs for Apple Music so you can upgrade your listening experience without wasting money on gear you do not need. Best DACs for 2026 DAC FAQs What does DAC stand for? DAC stands for digital to analogue converter. A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones. DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC). Some high-end DACs even include XLR outputs for better connectivity with professional audio equipment. The best DACs tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions like DSD. Most standalone DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into — in which case expect a hit to your battery life. Why do I need new hardware to listen to music? The short answer is, you don’t. You can play “hi-res” audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device’s audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that’s the experience you’ll get. If you want to enjoy better sounding music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you’ll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones, potentially using a headphone amp for an enhanced experience. It’s worth pointing out that “lossless” and “hi-res” are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses ALAC encoding which is compressed, but without “loss” to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate above 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above. This, of course, isn’t only about Apple’s new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s internal sound chipset often doesn’t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality. Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone? No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does). What about Bluetooth headphones? Chances are that over the last few years you’ve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you’re using (as those will technically be the “DAC”) and the codec — the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones. It’s also worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version. Look out for aptX HD, aptX Adaptive and (for the highest quality) aptX Lossless which are all better than standard and becoming more common, albeit slowly. It’s worth noting that both your phone or media player and your headphones need to support the same aptX codec. Currently, no iPhone supports any type of aptX, though dongles exist that will offer that functionality. Other higher-resolution Bluetooth codecs exist, like Sony’s LDAC, but Qualcomm’s AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss",

For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop’s internal sound chipset often doesn’t have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality. Okay, but can’t I just use the headphone adapter for my phone? No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you’re buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are “passive” and really just connect you to the phone’s internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does). What about Bluetooth headphones? Chances are that over the last few years you’ve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you’re using (as those will technically be the “DAC”) and the codec — the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones. It’s also worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version. Look out for aptX HD, aptX Adaptive and (for the highest quality) aptX Lossless which are all better than standard and becoming more common, albeit slowly. It’s worth noting that both your phone or media player and your headphones need to support the same aptX codec. Currently, no iPhone supports any type of aptX, though dongles exist that will offer that functionality. Other higher-resolution Bluetooth codecs exist, like Sony’s LDAC, but Qualcomm’s AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss",

If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you're on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product. AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag's location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.

          "title": "Palona goes vertical, launches Vision, Workflow: 4 key lessons for AI builders",
          "standfirst": "Building an enterprise AI company on a \"foundation of shifting sand\" is the central challenge for founders today, according to the leadership at Palona AI. Today, the Palo Alto-based startup—led by former Google and Meta engineering veterans—is making a decisive vertical push into the restaurant and hospitality space with today&#x27;s launch of Palona Vision and Palona Workflow. The new offerings transform the company’s multimodal agent suite into a real-time operating system for restaurant operations — spanning cameras, calls, conversations, and coordinated task execution.The news marks a strategic pivot from the company’s debut in early 2025, when it first emerged with $10 million in seed funding to build emotionally intelligent sales agents for broad direct-to-consumer enterprises. Now, by narrowing its focus to a \"multimodal native\" approach for restaurants, Palona is providing a blueprint for AI builders on how to move beyond \"thin wrappers\" to build deep systems that solve high-stakes physical world problems.“You’re building a company on top of a foundation that is sand—not quicksand, but shifting sand,” said co-founder and CTO Tim Howes, referring to the instability of today’s LLM ecosystem. “So we built an orchestration layer that lets us swap models on performance, fluency, and cost.”VentureBeat spoke with Howes and co-founder and CEO Maria Zhang in person recently at — where else? — a restaurant in NYC about the technical challenges and hard lessons learned from their launch, growth, and pivot.The New Offering: Vision and Workflow as a ‘Digital GM’For the end user—the restaurant owner or operator—Palona’s latest release is designed to function as an automated \"best operations manager\" that never sleeps.Palona Vision uses in-store security cameras to analyze operational signals — such as queue lengths, table turnover, prep bottlenecks, and cleanliness — without requiring any new hardware.It monitors front-of-house metrics like queue lengths, table turns, and cleanliness, while simultaneously identifying back-of-house issues like prep slowdowns or station setup errors.Palona Workflow complements this by automating multi-step operational processes. This includes managing catering orders, opening and closing checklists, and food prep fulfillment. By correlating video signals from Vision with Point-of-Sale (POS) data and staffing levels, Workflow ensures consistent execution across multiple locations. “Palona Vision is like giving every location a digital GM,” said Shaz Khan, founder of Tono Pizzeria + Cheesesteaks, in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “It flags issues before they escalate and saves me hours every week.”Going Vertical: Lessons in Domain ExpertisePalona’s journey began with a star-studded roster. CEO Zhang previously served as VP of Engineering at Google and CTO of Tinder, while Co-founder Howes is the co-inventor of LDAP and a former Netscape CTO. Despite this pedigree, the team’s first year was a lesson in the necessity of focus.Initially, Palona served fashion and electronics brands, creating \"wizard\" and \"surfer dude\" personalities to handle sales. However, the team quickly realized that the restaurant industry presented a unique, trillion-dollar opportunity that was \"surprisingly recession-proof\" but \"gobsmacked\" by operational inefficiency.\"Advice to startup founders: don&#x27;t go multi-industry,\" Zhang warned. By verticalizing, Palona moved from being a \"thin\" chat layer to building a \"multi-sensory information pipeline\" that processes vision, voice, and text in tandem.That clarity of focus opened access to proprietary training data (like prep playbooks and call transcripts) while avoiding generic data scraping. 1. Building on ‘Shifting Sand’To accommodate the reality of enterprise AI deployments in 2025 — with new, improved models coming out on a nearly weekly basis — Palona developed a patented orchestration layer.Rather than being \"bundled\" with a single provider like OpenAI or Google, Palona’s architecture allows them to swap models on a dime based on performance and cost. They use a mix of proprietary and open-source models, including Gemini for computer vision benchmarks and specific language models for Spanish or Chinese fluency. For builders, the message is clear: Never let your product&#x27;s core value be a single-vendor dependency.2. From Words to ‘World Models’The launch of Palona Vision represents a shift from understanding words to understanding the physical reality of a kitchen. While many developers struggle to stitch separate APIs together, Palona’s new vision model transforms existing in-store cameras into operational assistants.The system identifies \"cause and effect\" in real-time—recognizing if a pizza is undercooked by its \"pale beige\" color or alerting a manager if a display case is empty. \"In words, physics don&#x27;t matter,\" Zhang explained. \"But in reality, I drop the phone, it always goes down... we want to really figure out what&#x27;s going on in this world of restaurants\".3. The ‘Muffin’ Solution: Custom Memory ArchitectureOne of the most significant technical hurdles Palona faced was memory management. In a restaurant context, memory is the difference between a frustrating interaction and a \"magical\" one where the agent remembers a diner’s \"usual\" order.The team initially utilized an unspecified open-source tool, but found it produced errors 30% of the time. \"I think advisory developers always turn off memory [on consumer AI products], because that will guarantee to mess everything up,\" Zhang cautioned.To solve this, Palona built Muffin, a proprietary memory management system named as a nod to web \"cookies\". Unlike standard vector-based approaches that struggle with structured data, Muffin is architected to handle four distinct layers:Structured Data: Stable facts like delivery addresses or allergy information.Slow-changing Dimensions: Loyalty preferences and favorite items.Transient and Seasonal Memories: Adapting to shifts like preferring cold drinks in July versus hot cocoa in winter.Regional Context: Defaults like time zones or language preferences.The lesson for builders: If the best available tool isn&#x27;t good enough for your specific vertical, you must be willing to build your own.4. Reliability through ‘GRACE’In a kitchen, an AI error isn&#x27;t just a typo; it’s a wasted order or a safety risk. A recent incident at Stefanina’s Pizzeria in Missouri, where an AI hallucinated fake deals during a dinner rush, highlights how quickly brand trust can evaporate when safeguards are absent.To prevent such chaos, Palona’s engineers follow its internal GRACE framework:Guardrails: Hard limits on agent behavior to prevent unapproved promotions.Red Teaming: Proactive attempts to \"break\" the AI and identify potential hallucination triggers.App Sec: Lock down APIs and third-party integrations with TLS, tokenization, and attack prevention systems.Compliance: Grounding every response in verified, vetted menu data to ensure accuracy.Escalation: Routing complex interactions to a human manager before a guest receives misinformation.This reliability is verified through massive simulation. \"We simulated a million ways to order pizza,\" Zhang said, using one AI to act as a customer and another to take the order, measuring accuracy to eliminate hallucinations.The Bottom LineWith the launch of Vision and Workflow, Palona is betting that the future of enterprise AI isn&#x27;t in broad assistants, but in specialized \"operating systems\" that can see, hear, and think within a specific domain. In contrast to general-purpose AI agents, Palona’s system is designed to execute restaurant workflows, not just respond to queries — it&#x27;s capable of remembering customers, hearing them order their \"usual,\" and monitoring the restaurant operations to ensure they deliver that customer the food according to their internal processes and guidelines, flagging whenever something goes wrong or crucially, is about to go wrong.For Zhang, the goal is to let human operators focus on their craft: \"If you&#x27;ve got that delicious food nailed... we’ll tell you what to do.\"",

          "standfirst": "You can add Japan to the list of regions where Apple has been forced to do something it would rather not: open up the App Store. On Thursday, the company announced changes to iOS in Japan to comply with the nation's Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA). The tighter regulations for Apple and Google, which overlap with Europe's, took effect today. Users in the US and elsewhere won't see any of these changes.Apple's changes in iOS 26.2 in Japan revolve around alternative app stores, payments outside the App Store and browser choice. The company worked with Japanese regulators on new protections for increased security risks.The company calls this set of safeguards Notarization. It involves an authorization process for alternative app stores and child-safety protocols. Third-party marketplaces will need to undergo a baseline security review. This uses a combination of human and automated checks to block malware and other threats.Naturally, Apple cautions that Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Store's reviews. \"The App Store — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store's high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love,\" the company wrote.To state the obvious, the App Store is a booming business for the iPhone maker. In 2024, it generated $1.3 trillion in total sales. Opening it up poses a threat to one of the company's most reliable revenue streams. Big Tech seems to talk a lot about fewer rewards and more penalties for users when their own money trees are at risk.Apple CEO Tim Cook in Tokyo in October 2025ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty ImagesiOS 26.2 in Japan also introduces new payment options. Developers can now use non-Apple payment processors within their apps or link to external websites for purchases. (Children's content is exempt from this.) Here, Apple again warns the user about the penalties for doing something that will hurt its bottom line. \"For apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams or fraud,\" the company cautioned.The last big change involves picking defaults within the operating system. Users in Japan will see new browser and search engine choice screens. They'll also find default controls for navigation apps and app stores. Finally, developers can now offer browsers that use alternative engines other than Apple's WebKit.Apple's announcement comes a day after Google detailed its compliance with the MSCA. Since Android is more open than iOS, Google's changes in response to the regulations are a bit less pronounced. Android users will find new browser / search choice screens, expanded billing options and side-by-side comparisons of external vs. Play Store payment options.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-opens-up-ios-in-japan-in-response-to-new-regulations-174854950.html?src=rss",

This uses a combination of human and automated checks to block malware and other threats.Naturally, Apple cautions that Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Store's reviews. \"The App Store — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store's high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love,\" the company wrote.To state the obvious, the App Store is a booming business for the iPhone maker. In 2024, it generated $1.3 trillion in total sales. Opening it up poses a threat to one of the company's most reliable revenue streams. Big Tech seems to talk a lot about fewer rewards and more penalties for users when their own money trees are at risk.Apple CEO Tim Cook in Tokyo in October 2025ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty ImagesiOS 26.2 in Japan also introduces new payment options. Developers can now use non-Apple payment processors within their apps or link to external websites for purchases. (Children's content is exempt from this.) Here, Apple again warns the user about the penalties for doing something that will hurt its bottom line. \"For apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams or fraud,\" the company cautioned.The last big change involves picking defaults within the operating system. Users in Japan will see new browser and search engine choice screens. They'll also find default controls for navigation apps and app stores. Finally, developers can now offer browsers that use alternative engines other than Apple's WebKit.Apple's announcement comes a day after Google detailed its compliance with the MSCA. Since Android is more open than iOS, Google's changes in response to the regulations are a bit less pronounced. Android users will find new browser / search choice screens, expanded billing options and side-by-side comparisons of external vs. Play Store payment options.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-opens-up-ios-in-japan-in-response-to-new-regulations-174854950.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you're struggling to find your next binge-watch, you can't go wrong with anime. For the holidays, you can save on a Crunchyroll subscription, giving you access to its vast library of anime series to watch. Through December 29, you can sign up for an annual Fan subscription for $67, down from the usual $80, or a Mega Fan subscription for $100, down from $120. While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll's library, new episodes \"shortly after they air in Japan\" and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store. Notably missing from either subscription is access to Crunchyroll's new Manga service, but unless you're specifically looking for reading material, you'll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll's video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You'll find long-running series like One Piece and newer hits like Spy X Family, alongside hundreds of more niche series. Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was acquired by Sony, it's been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already produced poor results. It's hard to beat Crunchyroll's library, though, and for as little as $65, you'll get more than your money's worth.

Rather than building and maintaining multiple specialized AI systems, organizations can invest in creating and curating skills that encode their institutional knowledge and best practices.Anthropic&#x27;s own internal research supports this approach.

This lets Alexa+ answer the doorbell and converse with visitors, which certainly sounds futuristic in a \"gated community as dystopia\" kind of way. There are several caveats here. First of all, it only works with certain newer Ring video doorbell models. Customers also have to pony up for a Ring Premium Plan and have access to the Alexa+ early access build. It's available in the US and Canada and only in English. If you meet those criteria, this could be a fairly useful little feature. Amazon says it \"transforms your Ring doorbell into an intelligent assistant capable of determining who's at your door, understanding what they need and responding conversationally.\" The company promises that the tool operates whether people or home or out doing errands. How does this work? It's an AI algorithm that \"determines who's there based on what they're wearing, holding or their actions.\" It will use \"visual context, any information the visitor shares and the instructions it's been given to help manage interactions on your behalf.\" Amazon says that it can, for instance, distinguish if a person is wearing a delivery uniform and tell them to leave the package at the back door. Most of my delivery drivers don't come to the door in full uniforms because it's winter and that would be ridiculous. I don't even expect that during the summer. In other words, this is modern AI and mistakes will happen. The company gives other examples of how this could be used, like gathering messages from friends who stop by and telling door-to-door salespeople to (politely) bug off. Amazon also says Alexa+ will be able to direct visitors to water and snacks that have previously been laid out. Finally, there's a way to avoid those pesky cute kids on Halloween while still providing them with treats. Everything can be reviewed later on via the Ring app, which should provide context as to who has been hanging around the porch. Alexa+ Greetings are rolling out today.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has begun accepting submissions from third-party developers for their apps to be accessible directly in ChatGPT, and has launched a new App Directory (don&#x27;t call it a \"store\"!) that can be opened from the ChatGPT sidebar and at the URL chatgpt.com/apps.This means the 800 million+ users of OpenAI&#x27;s hit chatbot can search for, discover and begin using newly approved third-party apps immediately. Once installed, apps can be triggered during conversations by mentioning them by name (using @) or selecting them from the tools menu.The third-party app submission process officially went live last night, December 17, as OpenAI announced in a blog post and on its developer account on X, though the company notes it will be reviewing all new third-party app submissions before approving them for listing in the App Directory, and making them available to ChatGPT users, to ensure they comply with the company&#x27;s public guidelines. Apps that pass OpenAI’s review process will begin rolling out to users starting early 2026.For those enterprises who want to get in on the action with their own ChatGPT apps, OpenAI said it will host a public webinar “Build Hour” event for third-party developers on January 21, where OpenAI engineers will walk through how to build, submit, and design apps for ChatGPT, using real-world examples and taking questions.App Directory vs. GPT StoreThis whole effort marks the start of a broader developer ecosystem beyond the small set of curated partners OpenAI launched its Apps standard development kit (SDK) earlier this fall, and seems to be fulfilling some of the hype that ensued back when OpenAI debuted its \"GPT Store\" back in early 2024, nearly two years ago. However, despite the pledge of revenue sharing that OpenAI made back then, it hasn&#x27;t since provided many updates on the GPT Store, nor have we heard much from GPT builders about making substantive revenue from it. But while those custom, user-generated GPTs were limited primarily to text-based experiences, the new ChatGPT App Directory and SDK features allow for a far more interactive experience including user accessible buttons, maps, multi-views, sliders, shaders, and other interaction modalities. The GPT Store also still remains available now.Monetization, restrictions, and review processIn this early phase, ChatGPT apps may link out to external websites to complete purchases for physical goods only. Selling digital goods, subscriptions, or in‑app services isn&#x27;t yet allowed, though OpenAI says it is exploring additional monetization options over time.All apps must:Comply with OpenAI’s usage policiesBe suitable for general audiences, including teensInclude a clear privacy policy and support contactAvoid advertising, deceptive behavior, or prohibited commerce categoriesDevelopers submit apps through the OpenAI Developer Platform, where they can track review status. Only one version of an app can be under review at a time.What this means for developers and usersOpenAI first introduced the Apps SDK at its DevDay conference in October, positioning it as a way to build “apps inside of ChatGPT.” CEO Sam Altman described the vision as enabling “a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized.”Built on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) developed by rival Anthropic, the Apps SDK lets developers connect external services, fetch real-time context, trigger actions, and render UI directly inside ChatGPT. Until now, ChatGPT apps were limited to a list of seven pilot partners including:Booking.comCanvaCourseraExpediaFigmaSpotifyZillowThat list has since expanded to dozens of new apps, including popular software like Adobe PhotoShop (and Acrobat and Express), Github, Replit, Gmail and Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, Mailchimp, Stripe, and many more. And with general submissions now open, any verified developer—from solo builders to large enterprises—can build and submit apps for ChatGPT, provided they meet OpenAI’s quality, safety, and privacy standards.For users, the change means ChatGPT can now act as a hub for specialized tools and workflows. Apps can extend conversations by pulling in live data, rendering interactive interfaces, or taking actions on a user’s behalf—like designing a presentation, searching for housing, or interacting with an external service—without leaving the chat.Apps can appear in several formats, including:Inline cards or carousels inside the conversationFullscreen views for immersive tasks like maps or slide decksPicture‑in‑picture modes for video, tutorials, or live sessionsThe goal, OpenAI says, is to keep everything feeling conversational while adding real utility.How ChatGPT is handling Apps dataOne of the biggest open questions around ChatGPT apps is how user data is handled when third‑party apps are involved. Based on OpenAI’s documentation and guidelines, here’s what is clear—and what remains unanswered.What OpenAI has stated clearly:When a user connects to an app, ChatGPT discloses what types of data may be shared with the third party and surfaces the app’s privacy policy before connection.Third‑party developers are responsible for how their apps handle data once received.Apps must minimize data collection, requesting only what is necessary to perform a specific task.Apps are prohibited from requesting full chat transcripts, broad contextual data “just in case,” or sensitive personal data.Any action that sends data outside ChatGPT or modifies external systems must be clearly labeled and require user confirmation.Apps must not reconstruct or infer a user’s full chat history and must avoid undisclosed tracking or profiling.What OpenAI has not clarified publicly:Whether OpenAI itself retains or logs the data passed between ChatGPT and third‑party apps.Whether data exchanged with apps can be used for model training or internal analytics.How long, if at all, OpenAI stores metadata or interaction traces related to app usage.As a result, while OpenAI emphasizes strong guardrails for developers and transparency for users, it has not explicitly detailed OpenAI’s own role as a data processor in app interactions. That ambiguity has already drawn scrutiny and remains an open issue as the app ecosystem expands.The bigger pictureWith app submissions now open and an App Directory live, ChatGPT is no longer just a conversational AI—it’s becoming a distribution platform for AI‑native software.Developers get access to a massive built‑in audience, while users gain tools that can be discovered and used at the moment they’re needed, directly inside a conversation.OpenAI describes this as “just the beginning.” But with the infrastructure now in place, the shift from chatbot to app ecosystem is officially underway.",
          "content": "OpenAI has begun accepting submissions from third-party developers for their apps to be accessible directly in ChatGPT, and has launched a new App Directory (don&#x27;t call it a \"store\"!) that can be opened from the ChatGPT sidebar and at the URL chatgpt.com/apps.This means the 800 million+ users of OpenAI&#x27;s hit chatbot can search for, discover and begin using newly approved third-party apps immediately. Once installed, apps can be triggered during conversations by mentioning them by name (using @) or selecting them from the tools menu.The third-party app submission process officially went live last night, December 17, as OpenAI announced in a blog post and on its developer account on X, though the company notes it will be reviewing all new third-party app submissions before approving them for listing in the App Directory, and making them available to ChatGPT users, to ensure they comply with the company&#x27;s public guidelines. Apps that pass OpenAI’s review process will begin rolling out to users starting early 2026.For those enterprises who want to get in on the action with their own ChatGPT apps, OpenAI said it will host a public webinar “Build Hour” event for third-party developers on January 21, where OpenAI engineers will walk through how to build, submit, and design apps for ChatGPT, using real-world examples and taking questions.App Directory vs. GPT StoreThis whole effort marks the start of a broader developer ecosystem beyond the small set of curated partners OpenAI launched its Apps standard development kit (SDK) earlier this fall, and seems to be fulfilling some of the hype that ensued back when OpenAI debuted its \"GPT Store\" back in early 2024, nearly two years ago. However, despite the pledge of revenue sharing that OpenAI made back then, it hasn&#x27;t since provided many updates on the GPT Store, nor have we heard much from GPT builders about making substantive revenue from it. But while those custom, user-generated GPTs were limited primarily to text-based experiences, the new ChatGPT App Directory and SDK features allow for a far more interactive experience including user accessible buttons, maps, multi-views, sliders, shaders, and other interaction modalities.

          "standfirst": "If you're like me, it's probably been a hot minute since you’ve used or even thought of Meetup. Predating both Facebook and Twitter, the website, which was designed to help people organize in-person events, has changed hands a handful of times in recent years. In 2017, founder Scott Heiferman sold it to WeWork, which offloaded it a few years later before declaring bankruptcy in 2023. As of 2024, Bending Spoons, the Italian tech company that's probably best known for buying Evernote in 2022, has been running Meetup. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the platform has seen something of resurgence. As of late 2025, Gen Z and young Millennials make up 40 percent of Meetup's active user base and represent its most engaged group of users. This year, the app has also seen a 20 percent year-over-year increase in new registrations. Going into 2026, Bending Spoons is hoping to build on that momentum with a redesign of Meetup's mobile app. The new interface, which starts rolling out today, brings the Android and iOS app inline with Meetup's recently redesigned website. Across the application, users can expect updated fonts, new more colorful icons and better spacing. The goal of the redesign is to make the app \"vibrant, fun and more modern than before,\" says Chiara Vivaldi, Meetup's product lead. She adds the redesigned app retains all the key features found in the previous version, while making those easier to find. For instance, users can access their profile and groups directly from the homepage of the app. Beyond making Meetup feel more modern, Bending Spoon is using the redesign to cement the groundwork for a series of improvements it plans to roll out in the coming months. Soon, Meetup users will be able to see a breakdown of the people who have signed up for an event.Bending SpoonsAccording to Vivaldi, one major priority is to give people, particularly women, more confidence to attend the events that are listed on Meetup. When you navigate to an event page in the new app, you'll see a broad gender and age breakdown of the users who have signed up to be there. Additionally, new and richer user profiles allow people to get a better sense of who exactly they might meet if they decide to go. Bending Spoons is also introducing a new Super Organizer badge it plans to award to the platform's top event planners. It's designed to signal to users that the person who put together the event takes community building seriously. Taken together, Vivaldi says these features are designed to reduce the friction of attending events where you might not know anyone, and they're something the company plans to build on in the future. At the same time, Bending Spoons plans to make it easier for organizers to use Meetup. Starting early next year, the company will unify Meetup's two disparate apps — right now, the company maintains separate ones for members and organizers. Vivaldi says organizers can expect the unified app to include all of the features they depend on, alongside a handful of enhancements. For instance, Vivaldi’s team is working to make QR-based ticketing the norm for check-ins and attendance tracking. She says the move to a single app is informed by the fact that 75 percent of Meetup's organizers got their start as a member. \"[Organizers] are part of the community. They want to be in the action, and so having them within the same app is conducive to that. They can jump into conversations, look at other events, making it all feel a bit more organic,\" Vivaldi said. In the meantime, if it’s been since you’ve used Meetup, you can download the redesigned app from the App and Google Play stores.

Apple released the Mac mini M4 in late 2024 and we were impressed with how something so small could be so powerful.

You can pick up the Mac Mini M4 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799 — a 14 percent discount.

OpenAI also noted in a help document that \"connector\" apps like Google Drive are now simply called \"apps.\" The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit \"Connect\" then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you'll be able to \"gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,\" according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it. A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into \"an actionable shopping cart.\" Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company's app submission guidelines. It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including best practices, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step quickstart guide. That's on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI introduced in October. OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website — but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide \"clear\" policies. The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman's promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of custom \"GPT\" bots. \"Over time, we want apps in ChatGPT to feel like a natural extension of the conversation, helping people move from ideas to action, while building a thriving ecosystem for developers,\" the company wrote.

The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it). Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation.

They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget's Billy Steele wrote in his review, \"Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.\" In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you'll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s AirPods have become the default choice for many people, whether you want simple wireless earbuds that work without fuss or premium options with features like noise cancellation and spatial audio. The lineup has grown over the years, so there is now a model for almost every type of listener. Some pairs are built for all-day comfort, others focus on isolation and richer sound, and Apple’s over-ear option offers a more immersive experience for movies and music.If you spend most of your time on an iPhone or iPad, all AirPods share one big advantage: they connect instantly and switch between Apple devices seamlessly. With new models always on the horizon and longtime favorites still holding up well, we rounded up the best AirPods to help you decide which ones match your listening style. Table of contents What you need to know about AirPods Best AirPods for 2026 Best AirPods specs comparison chart Other AirPods we tested What you need to know about AirPods When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats. There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones.

          "content": "Apple’s AirPods have become the default choice for many people, whether you want simple wireless earbuds that work without fuss or premium options with features like noise cancellation and spatial audio. The lineup has grown over the years, so there is now a model for almost every type of listener. Some pairs are built for all-day comfort, others focus on isolation and richer sound, and Apple’s over-ear option offers a more immersive experience for movies and music.If you spend most of your time on an iPhone or iPad, all AirPods share one big advantage: they connect instantly and switch between Apple devices seamlessly. With new models always on the horizon and longtime favorites still holding up well, we rounded up the best AirPods to help you decide which ones match your listening style. Table of contents What you need to know about AirPods Best AirPods for 2026 Best AirPods specs comparison chart Other AirPods we tested What you need to know about AirPods When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats. There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.

          "standfirst": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. ESPN Unlimited bundle — $30/month with Disney+ and Hulu for free for one year: Sports fans can sign up for the new ESPB Unlimited bundle at the standard $30-per-month rate, but for a limited time, you can get Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) included in that price for free. The trio bundle would typically cost you $36 per month, so overall, you're saving $6 per month for one year, for a total of $72 in savings. Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Crunchyroll — $67 for one year ($13 off): Anime fans can get one year of Crunchyroll access for less right now. The Fan tier is down to $67 for the year, while the Mega Fan tier is on sale for $100 for one year. Both tiers give you ad-free access to the streaming service, but you'll get offline access and up to four simultaneous streams with the Mega Fan option. Note that this deal does not include access to Crunchyroll Manga. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon's own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "standfirst": "There’s a good chance you own a couple of gadgets that support wireless charging now, be it your iPhone or Android phone, wireless earbuds or smartwatch. Multi-device wireless chargers can help power them all up in one place, without the need for a bunch of cords messing up your space. There are dozens of these accessories out there today, and we’ve tested a bunch of the most popular models. You’ll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs. Table of contents Best wireless charging pads Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device? How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs Wireless charging speed and performance Best wireless charging pads Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device? The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category). When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up. Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a magnetic adapter for pretty cheap that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers. You’ll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are “Qi2 ready,” but since they do not have magnets built in, aren’t precisely Qi2 compliant. How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner. If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones. A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it. For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole. Wireless charging speed and performance It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung. Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they're still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough. If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

You’ll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are “Qi2 ready,” but since they do not have magnets built in, aren’t precisely Qi2 compliant. How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner. If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones. A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it. For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole. Wireless charging speed and performance It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung. Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they're still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough. If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "With the recent release of GPT 5.2, OpenAI updated other related models, including its popular coding model Codex, bringing more agentic use cases to its fold. GPT-5.2-Codex, which OpenAI called in a blog post “the most advanced agentic coding model yet for complex, real-world software engineer,” has been optimized for long-horizon work with agents and will have stronger cybersecurity capabilities. The model is an offshoot of GPT-5.2, optimized for agentic building. “GPT‑5.2-Codex represents a step forward in how advanced AI can support real-world software engineering and specialized domains like cybersecurity—helping developers and defenders tackle complex, long-horizon work, and strengthening the tools available for responsible security research,” the company said in its blog post. Enterprises can access the new Codex model “in all Codex surfaces for paid ChatGPT users, and working towards safely enabling access to GPT‑5.2-Codex for API users in the coming weeks.” The company is also piloting a program with invite-only trusted users to access “more permissive models for vetted professionals and organizations” for defensive cybersecurity work to determine a balance between accessibility and safety. Advances in cybersecurity with models OpenAI calls GPT-5.2-Codex its strongest cybersecurity model yet. Still, as its capabilities grow, the company said it needs to design a deployment approach that accounts for future growth and supports defensive cybersecurity. “As our models continue to advance along the intelligence frontier, we’ve observed that these improvements also translate to capability jumps in specialized domains such as cybersecurity⁠,” the company said. OpenAI said in its system card that it tested the model on three benchmarks: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) evals, CVE-Bench and Cyber Range. GPT-5.2-Codex became the company’s strongest-performing model in CTF evals, which they attributed to compaction, or “the ability for the model to work coherently across multiple context windows.”The model scored 87% in CVE-Bench, outperforming other models, with GPT-5.1-Codex-Max coming in a close second. This increase would be helpful for tasks involving running commands around vulnerability discovery and trying tools “with an almost brute-force approach.”In the long-form Cyber Range test, the model had a combined pass rate of 72.7%. GPT-5.1-Codex-Max scored 81.8%. Cybersecurity deployment projectOpenAI said some users of its GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, which launched in November, uncovered a source code exposure vulnerability in React and subsequently reported it. According to OpenAI, Andrew MacPherson, a security researcher at Privy, used GPT-5.1-Codex-Max to assess how well the model could support real-world vulnerability research. The model instead surfaced unexpected behavior. With improvements in cybersecurity capabilities for GPT-5.2-Codex and potentially for models that come after it, OpenAI said it needs to balance the deployment of frontier models with the necessary tools for defensive cybersecurity. While GPT-5.2-Codex “does not reach a high level of cyber capability under our Preparedness Framework,” the company plans to bring selected users to test security capabilities. (OpenAI’s Preparedness Framework to measure and track potential harms from AI to humans)“Security teams can run into restrictions when attempting to emulate threat actors, analyze malware to support remediation, or stress test critical infrastructure. We are developing a trusted access pilot to remove that friction for qualifying users and organizations and enable trusted defenders to use frontier AI cyber capabilities to accelerate cyberdefense.” OpenAI said. Agentic frontiers GPT-5.2 already received praise from users for its use in business tasks and workflows. With the Codex version, some of those capabilities could transfer, especially as enterprises plan to use the model to code their agents. The company said the model improves long-horizon work through compaction, offering strong performance on extensive code changes. It also features improved performance on Windows. In benchmark testing, GPT-5.2-Codex performed the best on accuracy compared to its previous versions. \"With these improvements, Codex is more capable at working in large repositories over extended sessions with full context intact. It can more reliably complete complex tasks like large refactors, code migrations, and feature builds — continuing to iterate without losing track, even when plans change or attempts fail,\" OpenAI said. Since it launched in previews in May, Codex has helped usher in acceptance of agentic and vibe coding in the enterprise AI builder space. Along with Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code and the many coding agents from Google, the platform moved LLMs from simple code completion to generating and starting asynchronous coding projects for users.",

According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data. SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results. Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”Read full article Comments",

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper. The cost of armor In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.Read full article Comments",

Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console. Earlier this week, R-Type Dimensions III publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "At this point, most competitive online multiplayer games on the PC come with some kind of kernel-level anti-cheat software. As we’ve written before, this is software that runs with more elevated privileges than most other apps and games you run on your PC, allowing it to load in earlier and detect advanced methods of cheating. More recently, anti-cheat software has started to require more Windows security features like Secure Boot, a TPM 2.0 module, and virtualization-based memory integrity protection. Riot Games, best known for titles like Valorant and League of Legends and the Vanguard anti-cheat software, has often been one of the earliest to implement new anti-cheat requirements. There’s already a long list of checks that systems need to clear before they’ll be allowed to play Riot’s games online, and now the studio is announcing a new one: a BIOS update requirement that will be imposed on “certain players” following Riot’s discovery of a UEFI bug that could allow especially dedicated and motivated cheaters to circumvent certain memory protections. In short, the bug affects the input-output memory management unit (IOMMU) “on some UEFI-based motherboards from multiple vendors.” One feature of the IOMMU is to protect system memory from direct access during boot by external hardware devices, which otherwise might manipulate the contents of your PC’s memory in ways that could enable cheating.Read full article Comments",

It didn’t charge very fast, and people found the seats quite uncomfortable. But it could get more than 230 miles on a single charge—a lot in 2017—and you didn’t have to be flush to afford one. Oh, and it was also pretty good to drive. I know I was a fan from the first time I tried a prototype at CES in 2016. Understandably, Bolt fans were upset when Chevy decided to kill off the car. Yes, it lacked features compared to more modern EVs, but it is also the brand‘s bestselling EV by quite a country mile. “Not to worry,” said the executives, who told us they had something better coming built on the platform they used to call Ultium but don’t anymore. Starting at around the same $35,000 price tag the Bolt launched with, this would be the new Equinox EV. That $34,995 price tag was perhaps a bit more appealing when the car was eligible for the now-dead $7,500 IRS clean vehicle tax credit. Truth be told, the LT1 spec is a little bare-boned, and you’ll need to step up to the LT2 we tested—which starts at $40,295—if you want things like heated seats or wireless charging for your devices. (The good news here is that people looking for a bargain should know that used Equinox EVs with decent specs are already much cheaper, just a year after the car’s launch.) And let’s not forget, when the Bolt was young, the more expensive trim was almost $42,000.Read full article Comments",

To see how effective these modern AI coding tools are becoming, we decided to test four major models with a simple task: re-creating the classic Windows game Minesweeper.

The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility. A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers).

Upon completion in the mid-2030s, the station would encompass seven shiny new modules, potentially including a private habitat for space tourists. It would be so sophisticated that the station could fly autonomously for months if needed. Importantly, the Russian station was also to fly in a polar orbit at about 400 km. This would allow the station to fly over the entirety of Russia, observing the whole country. It would be important for national pride because cosmonauts would not need to launch from Kazakhstan anymore.

The channels produced videos with titles like “GTA: San Andreas (2025) Teaser Trailer” and “Malcom In The Middle Reboot (2025) First Trailer.” Of course, neither of those projects exist, but that didn’t stop them from appearing in user feeds. Google demonetized the channels in early 2025, forcing them to adopt language that made it clear they were not official trailers. The channels were able to monetize again, but the disclaimers were not consistently used. Indeed, many of the most popular videos from those channels in recent months included no “parody” or “concept trailer” disclosures. Now, visiting either channel’s page on YouTube produces an error reading, “This page isn’t available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "After a year of stalled negotiations, TikTok owner ByteDance has reportedly agreed to Donald Trump’s deal giving US owners majority ownership of the app. By signing the agreements, ByteDance has ended a prolonged period of uncertainty for millions of Americans who rely on TikTok for news, entertainment, social connection, and income. Under a law that Trump declined to enforce—which lawmakers convinced the Supreme Court was critical for national security—TikTok risked a US ban next year if the sale did not go through. According to Reuters, terms of the deal match what was reported in September when Trump controversially confirmed that ByteDance would keep the algorithm. Under the deal, US investors and allies—including cloud computing firm Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX—will likely license the algorithm.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Four small satellites rode a Rocket Lab Electron launch vehicle into orbit from Virginia early Thursday, beginning a government-funded technology demonstration mission to test the performance of a new spacecraft design. The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility at 12:03 am EST (05:03 UTC). A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers). The launch was the starting gun for a proof-of-concept mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats. These satellites were designed by the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit federally funded research and development center. The project is jointly financed by NASA and the US Space Force, which paid for DiskSat’s development and launch, respectively.Read full article Comments",

There are some notable points in the document that clearly reflect the White House’s priorities, though, and Isaacman’s leadership of NASA.Read full article Comments",

Starting next year, instead of the profile page just showing your different Peacock profiles, most of the page will be dominated by an advertorial image. The circles of NBCUniversal-owned characters selected for user profiles will be relegated to a vertical column on the screen’s left side, as you can see here. To avoid seeing what NBCUniversal is calling “Arrival Ads” every time you open Peacock, you need to subscribe to Peacock’s most expensive plan, which is ad-free and starts at $17 per month (Peacock’s ad-based plans start at $8/month.)Read full article Comments",

In the first week or so of the drive, over 300 readers have contributed nearly $18,000 to either the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Child’s Play as part of the charity drive (Child’s Play has a roughly 55/45 donation lead at the moment). That’s still a long way from 2020’s record haul of over $58,000, but there’s plenty of time until the Charity Drive wraps up on Friday, January 2, 2026.

Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “Roman Wall Blues,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology. As previously reported, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, we reported on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.) Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia analyzed the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.Read full article Comments",
