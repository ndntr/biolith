          "standfirst": "Disney fans and binge-watchers, rejoice. The Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) is getting a holiday discount again this year, bringing both platforms together for one low price of $5 per month for one year. The bundle includes the Disney+ basic plan with ads and Hulu’s basic plan with ads. If you’re a new subscriber or an eligible returning customer, you can get this discount that brings the cost of both services down to $60 in total for one year. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

          "standfirst": "You’re not alone if you’re consistently aghast at the rising cost of streaming services. This year in particular has been bleak, with Disney+ and HBO Max being just a couple of the services that have increased prices as of late. If you’re like any of us at Engadget, you probably subscribe to more than a few of these services, and costs quickly add up even without the period price increases. While you can find the occasional streaming deal throughout the year, Black Friday is the time when they are most abundant. These are the best Black Friday streaming deals we found for 2025. Just note that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well. If you're looking for a more affordable plan, the News + Sports tier has a $10 discount for new subscribers. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. DirecTV — starting at $50/month for one month: All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-black-friday-streaming-deals-for-2025-one-year-of-the-disney-hulu-bundle-for-60-plus-save-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-and-more-094257206.html?src=rss",
          "content": "You’re not alone if you’re consistently aghast at the rising cost of streaming services. This year in particular has been bleak, with Disney+ and HBO Max being just a couple of the services that have increased prices as of late. If you’re like any of us at Engadget, you probably subscribe to more than a few of these services, and costs quickly add up even without the period price increases. While you can find the occasional streaming deal throughout the year, Black Friday is the time when they are most abundant. These are the best Black Friday streaming deals we found for 2025. Just note that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well.

          "title": "An indie studio says it's at risk of closure after Valve banned its game from Steam",
          "standfirst": "Indie studio Santa Ragione said it is at risk of shutting down as its latest project won't be available on Steam, which is by far the biggest storefront for PC games and a key point of sale for many developers. Horses, a first-person horror game that blends gameplay and live-action sequences, is about a college student who spends a summer working on a farm. However, the farm’s “horses” are actually naked human adults who are wearing horse masks. It’s clear from the trailer that this is a game for grownups.The studio plans to release Horses on the Epic Games Store, GOG, Itch and the Humble Store on December 2. However, Valve's content review team blocked Horses from Steam.\"We reviewed the game back in 2023. At that time, the developer indicated with their release date in Steamworks that they planned to release a few months later. Based on content in the store page, we told the developer we would need to review the build itself. This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines,” Valve told PC Gamer. “After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam.\"Santa Ragione wrote in an FAQ that it's \"committed to producing challenging, adult storytelling. Horses uses grotesque, subversive imagery to confront power, faith, and violence. We reject subjective obscenity standards and believe this kind of moralizing censorship evokes a darker past in which vague notions of 'decency' were used to silence artists. Games are an artistic medium and lawful works for adults should remain accessible. We respect players enough to present the game as intended and to let adults choose what to play; lawful works should not be made unreachable by a monopolistic storefront’s opaque decisions.\"This particular ban precedes the recent censorship of adult-oriented games at the behest of payment processors. Santa Ragione wanted to create a Steam store page for Horses back in 2023 to help build interest. The studio says Valve wanted to see a playable build of the game before it would approve a Coming Soon page. The game was nowhere close to being finished, so Santa Ragione scrambled to put together a playable version of the game with “tons of placeholders.”According to an email from Valve that the developer shared, it banned Horses from the storefront over \"content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Santa Ragione said Valve didn't provide more detailed reasons for rejecting the game. Valve noted that it wouldn't accept further submissions of Horses, \"even with modifications.\"The developer claimed that it spent the next two years trying to change Valve's mind, but the company repeatedly pointed it to Steam’s general guidelines and rejected its “requests for review and appeal.\" Santa Ragione does have a plausible theory as to why Valve blocked the game from Steam, however. The studio wrote in the FAQ that:All characters in the game are clearly older than 20 years old, as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game. We think the ban may have been triggered during the initial Steam submission by an incomplete scene on day six, in which a man and his young daughter visit the farm. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the 'horses' are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one. What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag. We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character.As a result of the Steam ban, Santa Ragione claimed it will be “very difficult“ to recoup its investment on Horses, which it claims is “not pornographic”. It spent around $100,000 on the game’s development. The studio initially put $50,000 of its own money into Horses after signing a deal with the game's creator, Andrea Lucco Borlera. It hoped to cover those costs with sales of its last game, Saturnalia, but that didn't perform nearly as well as the studio hoped. Horses was slated to be featured in a bundle, but that fell apart around the same time as Valve rejected the game. Santa Ragione said the Steam ban made it practically impossible for it to find an external publisher or partner, so it ultimately raised funds from friends in order to complete the game. As such, the studio claimed it is now \"in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs.\"Santa Ragione still plans to support Horses for at least another six months after release. It has set aside funds to cover the costs of fixing bugs and adding quality-of-life changes. But barring Horses finding success on non-Steam storefronts, that may be the studio’s last activity.\"I don't want to make a final decision before seeing how the game does on launch. But if things go the way that I expect them to go, then I think [studio's closure] is inevitable,” Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva told GamesIndustry.biz. \"All the money we'll earn is gonna go to the author and to the people who have offered money to finish the project. So there will likely be no money left to make a new [game]... Unless a miracle happens and Horses does very well.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/an-indie-studio-says-its-at-risk-of-closure-after-valve-banned-its-game-from-steam-210047830.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during a discount period like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. Just as one example: Black Friday streaming deals on Disney and Hulu are cheaper than ever right now, so take advantage as soon as you can. On this list, we've gathered the top sales of all kinds of subscriptions. We've got some of the best VPNs to keep you anonymous online, MasterClass deals to continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses, and streaming deals for TV marathons on those long winter nights. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (two months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Two months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-include-huge-savings-on-hbo-max-apple-tv-masterclass-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000935.html?src=rss",

It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (two months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Two months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-include-huge-savings-on-hbo-max-apple-tv-masterclass-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000935.html?src=rss",

If you want to watch out-of-market games, a $7 monthly subscription to NFL+ will let you tune into every out-of-market local and primetime game in the season on your phone — but only a select few regular-season games on your TV. You could also spring for the uber-expensive NFL Sunday Ticket package to get every out-of-market Sunday game of the season.

Best white elephant gift ideas According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

Best white elephant gift ideas According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

As ever, you’ll retain access to claimed games as long as your subscription remains active.The headliner this time around is Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5), which is a more family-friendly take on the Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo gave the events of Horizon Zero Dawn a Lego flavor in this spinoff, which is the first co-op game in the series (an MMO is in the pipeline too). I’ve been meaning to check this out, so it’ll be an easy addition to my library.The same goes for Neon White (PS4 and PS5), a fast-paced precision platformer and first-person shooter that’s also part-dating sim. Each level is a race to the exit but you’ll need to defeat every demon in the stage first. There are a couple of first-person co-op horror games in the December lineup. Those are the action-focused title Killing Floor 3 (PS5) and the psychological survival horror The Outlast Trials (PS4 and PS5). The final entry in the Monthly Games lineup this time around is extraction shooter Synduality Echo of Ada (PS5). That could help you scratch an Arc Raiders-shaped itch if you don’t fancy shelling out for that particular game right now.All five games will be available for PS Plus Essential, Extra and Premium members to snag on December 2 and they’ll remain up for grabs until January 5.

While it might add PS4 games from time to time, the onus for PS Plus going forward will be on PS5 (and perhaps some PS VR2) games.

You can get six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, giving you a chance to stream award-winning originals like Severance, Ted Lasso and The Morning Show. The offer is live for a limited time through December 1, so if you haven’t signed up before, it’s a great time to see what the service has to offer. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Apple TV+ continues to build one of the strongest lineups in streaming. Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience. All content is ad-free and available in up to 4K HDR, with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support where available. The app works on nearly every device, from iPhone and iPad to smart TVs, PlayStation, Xbox and Roku. You can also download episodes and movies to watch offline, which is handy for travel or long commutes. If you’re already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the integration is seamless. You can share your subscription with up to five other people through Family Sharing, and playback syncs across devices so you can start a show on your iPhone and finish it on your TV. Apple TV+ is also part of the Apple One bundle if you prefer to manage multiple Apple services under a single plan. This deal is available to new and qualified returning subscribers, meaning those who haven’t had an active subscription in the past 30 days. You’ll need to sign up directly through Apple rather than a third-party service or carrier. Once the three-month period ends, the plan renews at the standard $13 per month, so be sure to cancel before the renewal date if you don’t want to continue. With a growing slate of original series, award-winning films and a slick interface, Apple TV+ has turned into one of the best streaming services for premium content. And with this limited-time deal, you can catch up on its biggest hits without paying full price. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

          "standfirst": "According to our reviews, Apple makes some of the best tech you can buy. But that doesn’t mean you have to pay full price for the devices. Now that Black Friday sales have arrived, we’re seeing plenty of discounts on iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches and more. A few of the discounts are hitting all-time lows (the AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch Series 11 and standard iPad, to name a few). Other prices are the best we’ve seen in months. If you’ve had your eye on a new iPad for the family, an Apple Watch for a gift or a pair of AirPods for yourself, this is the list to check out. Here are the best Apple Black Friday deals around. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $100 ($79 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $69 ($61 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $80. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $400 ($149 off) at Amazon: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. This $400 sale price matches the all-time low. The headphones are selling for $429 at Walmart. EarPods for $13 ($6 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Black Friday deal Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,399 ($157 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $49 ($30 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.

          "content": "According to our reviews, Apple makes some of the best tech you can buy. But that doesn’t mean you have to pay full price for the devices. Now that Black Friday sales have arrived, we’re seeing plenty of discounts on iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches and more. A few of the discounts are hitting all-time lows (the AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch Series 11 and standard iPad, to name a few). Other prices are the best we’ve seen in months. If you’ve had your eye on a new iPad for the family, an Apple Watch for a gift or a pair of AirPods for yourself, this is the list to check out. Here are the best Apple Black Friday deals around. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $100 ($79 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $69 ($61 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $80. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $400 ($149 off) at Amazon: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. This $400 sale price matches the all-time low. The headphones are selling for $429 at Walmart. EarPods for $13 ($6 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Black Friday deal Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch.

          "standfirst": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Scroll through any retailer’s sale pages and you’ll be overwhelmed with choices — not all of them good. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark. Cables, chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented and pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk). In short, these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday deals under $50. Engadget's top picks under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $12 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is it worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add on to your service.. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Apple TV (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Personally, I think Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+) is the most valuable streaming subscription I pay for. Slow Horses, Severance, Shape Island, The Studio, Murderbot, For All Mankind and, yes, even Ted Lasso are among the best shows on TV of the past few years. That’s before you factor in Pluribus, the new show from the creator of Better Call Saul. I pay full price, but if you’re a new or returning subscriber, you can get the next six months for just $36. The deal ends December 1 and automatically renews unless you cancel. You also have to subscribe directly through Apple, not a third-party service. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.

          "content": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Scroll through any retailer’s sale pages and you’ll be overwhelmed with choices — not all of them good. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark. Cables, chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented and pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk). In short, these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday deals under $50. Engadget's top picks under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $12 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is it worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add on to your service.. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Apple TV (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Personally, I think Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+) is the most valuable streaming subscription I pay for. Slow Horses, Severance, Shape Island, The Studio, Murderbot, For All Mankind and, yes, even Ted Lasso are among the best shows on TV of the past few years. That’s before you factor in Pluribus, the new show from the creator of Better Call Saul. I pay full price, but if you’re a new or returning subscriber, you can get the next six months for just $36. The deal ends December 1 and automatically renews unless you cancel. You also have to subscribe directly through Apple, not a third-party service. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.

          "standfirst": "It's a good idea to look for Black Friday Apple deals this time of year if you're thinking about upgrading an aging laptop or picking up a pair of AirPods or an Apple Watch as a gift. One of the best discounts we're tracking at the moment is on the M4-powered Mac Mini desktop — it's $120 off right now, down from $599 to $479. That applies to the 16GB of RAM/256GB SSD model, and it's pretty close to its all-time-low price. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $719, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $889, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

This model topped our list of the best action cameras, and for good reason. It's a fantastic device with all kinds of bells and whistles. It's the most versatile Hero camera that GoPro has ever made. There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved.

Xreal has discounted its One Pro smart glasses by $50 for Black Friday, bringing them down to $599. The sale applies to both sizes. These glasses are the real deal. We praised them in our official review, saying they offer similar functionality to the Apple Vision Pro, but at a much friendlier price point. Wearing these glasses allows access to a massive 222-inch virtual display that can be used for just about anything. The glasses connect to laptops, gaming consoles and smartphones, among other gadgets. The 1080p Micro-OLED screens are surprisingly bright and sharp, which makes this device great for both work and consuming content. The frames even darken to give the illusion of wearing sunglasses. The glasses are light and comfortable, especially when compared to the Vision Pro. However, the comfort does come at a price. These oversized glasses are not as immersive as Apple's product, because they don't completely block out light and cover the entire face. They offer a 57-degree field of view. This is squarely an augmented reality product and not a virtual reality product. The company has also discounted its Xreal One AR glasses to $399, which is a discount of around $100. These offer smaller virtual screens than the Pro, with a 50-degree field of view. Elsewhere in the smart glasses space, the Meta Ray Ban Gen 1 glasses are 20 percent off for Black Friday as well.

          "standfirst": "It's a good time to pick up a robot vacuum on sale for Black Friday. Shark machines are some of our favorites, and we're seeing a number of models discounted for Black Friday. But this one, the Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum, is probably the best deal for most people this year. It's 58 percent off and down to an all-time low of $250. One of this model's standout features is its bagless design. Like many robovacs, it has an auto-empty station. But here, you can remove part of the base, dump its contents in the garbage, and lock it back in place. The base holds up to 60 days of dirt and debris, and you'll never need to order bag refills. The Shark AI Ultra has strong suction and decent obstacle avoidance (via LiDAR). The robovac cleans in a matrix grid. It auto-maps your home and supports Google Assistant and Alexa for voice control. The vacuum has a runtime of about 120 minutes. (If it needs to stop and charge, it will auto-resume afterward.) Also note that this is a vacuum-only model: no mopping here. But Shark has other Black Friday deals if you're interested in a robovac that also mops, or even a cordless stick vacuum instead. The Shark Stratos 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop is 55 percent off and down to $450 right now, while the Power Detect Pet Plus cordless vacuum with self-emptying base is down to $400.

          "standfirst": "Loads of Anker gear is on sale for Black Friday, and we rounded up the best deals we could find right here. We decided we like Anker so much, it deserves its own roundup. Afterall, the brand makes some of our favorite accessories for keeping phones, tablets and computers charged up and otherwise connected with excellent wireless chargers, MagSafe power banks, iPad accessories and more. Part of why we love this stuff is the affordability — particularly for what you get — but now these Anker Black Friday deals make these buys an even better value. Don’t hesitate to stock up. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. And we think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Black Friday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands, not just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Black Friday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "One of the best streaming devices you can get today is deeply discounted on Amazon ahead of Black Friday. The Google TV Streamer is going for just $75 right now — the lowest price we've seen it hit yet. The device normally costs $100. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $85 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

          "standfirst": "Apple updated its flagship earbuds this year with the new AirPods Pro 3, but the AirPods Pro 2 were our top picks for the best wireless earbuds for Apple users for many years before that. They're a bit hard to find at this point, but Walmart Black Friday deals have come for them (in addition to a bunch of other Apple products). Walmart has the AirPods Pro 2 for $139, which is the lowest price we've ever seen them and more than $100 off their standard $249 price tag. During Black Friday last year, they dropped to around $155. At this price, the AirPods Pro 2 are a good option for anyone who wants most of the conveniences and features of the Pro 3s without spending nearly $100 more. They have excellent active noise cancellation and great sound quality, and thanks to a firmware update, they do support Apple's new Live Translation feature. Using the buds in tandem with the Translate app on iPhones running iOS 26 or later, you can translate foreign languages in conversation in real time, hearing other languages being spoken to you in your preferred language. Sound quality remains great on the Pro 2 and battery life hits at around six hours of use on a single charge with ANC enabled. The wireless charging case that comes with the Pro 2 actually offers more total hours of listening time than the Pro 3 — 30 hours in total, in comparison to the Pro 3's 24 hours. You also get most of Apple's health tracking capabilities along with all the conveniences of the H2 chipset, which includes quick pairing and switching, plus hands-free Siri. What you won't get here is built-in heart rate tracking and improved sound quality and ANC, all of which are stand-out features of the new Pro 3. In addition to the AirPods Pro 2, other AirPods are on sale for Black Friday. AirPods 4, both with and without ANC, are down to record-low or near-record low prices. Plus, the new AirPods Pro 3 are on sale for their best price since their launch in September. We'll update this post as more Walmart Black Friday tech deals come in.

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off all models. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, this is the deal to beat. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179. You'll find a ton of PlayStation Black Friday deals across the web right now, and they also include some game sales. Those include Astro Bot for $40 and Horizon Forbidden West for $20.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for Black Friday. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in our review, now for less. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others.

Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $274 (21 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $69 (47 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $89 (26 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $89 (26 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

          "standfirst": "The Black Friday sales have started, and that means it’s a decent time to be in the market for a new SSD. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget in need of a boost, we’re rounding up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we can find below. The offers already include a handful of well-regarded SSDs, external drives and microSD cards, but we’ll update this post as new deals arise that are actually worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off MSRP): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express Card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want more space for a Switch 2, the 512GB version of Samsung’s P9 Express card is also on sale for a new low of $75. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $190 at Best Buy ($130 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. It’s usually retailed for $250 in recent months. Also at B&H. If you don't want the heatsink, the drive alone is on sale for $10 less. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $750 at Amazon ($250 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Also at Best Buy. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are on sale as well, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. While this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-ssd-deals-for-2025-include-up-to-250-off-recommended-storage-devices-175429428.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you clicked on this story because you don't know what a fabric shaver is, you're not alone. That was me not too long ago when I started searching for something that could get rid of the pilling on some of my most loved pieces of clothing. Blessedly, I stumbled upon the Philips Fabric Shaver, a type of device I didn't even know existed, and decided to give it a shot. It's now an essential piece of tech in my house, and you don't have to pay as much as I did for it thanks to this Black Friday deal that knocks it down to $13. Sure, it may not seem revolutionary — especially if you already knew of the wonders of such devices — but it was for me. I have a lot of T-shirts, joggers, sweaters and more that I've had for at least three years and wear regularly. We also have a bunch of throw blankets around the house, partially because I love a good throw, and partially because my cat demands soft spots on which to sleep. All of those well-worn, well-loved fabrics have pilled over time, and I was tired of picking at the pills myself. This Philips Fabric Shaver makes it so I never have to do that anymore. It runs on two AA batteries, has a simple on-off switch and a shaving head with three sized holes that, as you glide it over your sweater or blanket, catches the pills and shaves them right off. It's literally as simple as that; after I tried it the first time on a pair of joggers, I spent far too much time running around my house and through my closet de-pilling as many things as I could. All the little fabric bits collect in a removable chamber that you simply empty as often as you need into the trash. If you're like me and try to make the most of the wardrobe you have and not buy new clothing all the time, this little gadget will keep the pieces in your closet looking fresh.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/you-need-a-fabric-shaver-and-my-favorite-is-on-sale-for-13-for-black-friday-163402239.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Best Black Friday TV deals for 2025: Save hundreds on sets from Samsung, LG, Sony and others",
          "standfirst": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s OK to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales already floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. If you're already happy with your TV, we've also included a few deals on media streamers we like. The current selection includes several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and Hisense, but we’ll update this post through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($750 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal comes within $20 of the best price we've seen for the 48-inch version. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-black-friday-tv-deals-for-2025-save-hundreds-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-others-181143641.html?src=rss",

Roku's Black Friday deals offer a bunch of options to consider: the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, which is one of our favorite streaming devices, is 50 percent off and sale for just $20. The regular Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick 4K have also received discounts: 50 percent off across the board, coming in at $15 and $25, respectively. Roku makes some of the best streaming devices you can get, and any of the ones on sale would be great picks to upgrade an old TV you already have. The Streaming Stick Plus is our favorite of the bunch since it supports 4K HDR content and gives you access to a bunch of free content thanks to Roku's streaming OS. We also appreciate its accurate universal search and the fact that it draws power from your TV, so it doesn't need to be plugged into a wall outlet to get power. The standard Streaming Stick is a good alternative to Amazon's most basic Fire TV Stick, and if you already prefer Roku's streaming OS, it's arguably the better choice. The Streaming Stick 4K adds Dolby Vision into the mix, if that's a must-have for you. Also, if you're looking for a more powerful set-top streaming box, the Roku Ultra is 30 percent off, marked down to $69 from $100.

          "standfirst": "If you're a creator in the market for a good-quality wireless microphone, DJI has the best deal we've ever seen on one of its most popular products. The company's Mic Mini kit, which includes two mics, a receiver and a charging case (plus two windscreens and other accessories), is on sale for just $80 at B&H Photo Video, or 53 percent ($90) off the regular price — far and away the best deal we've seen on this product. If you don't need the charging case, you can get it without for just $66 for a savings of 45 percent, or grab the bundle with a single mic, receiver, charging dock and accessories for $45, or 49 percent off the regular price. DJI's Mic Mini microphones (transmitters) weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit, 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 Pro and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. With a range of 1300 feet and 48 hours of battery life with the charger case, they're an excellent addition to a creator's bag of tricks. Again, note that you can grab one a big cheaper without the charing case. DJI's Mic Mini deal includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with the charging case, two windscreens, a splitter USB-C cable for charging, a 3.5mm camera audio cable, two magnetic clips, a smartphone adapter, a charging cable and a compact carrying case. At this price the deal may not last the week, so if you've been eyeing one, act quickly.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday Apple deals are here, and one of the best we're tracking is on the AirPods 4. They're down to $69 right now, which is a new record low. While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. Elsewhere when it comes to Black Friday AirPods deals, you can pick up the AirPods 4 with ANC for $100, the new AirPods Pro 3 for $220 and the AirPods Max (in certain colors) for $400.

          "title": "HBO Max Black Friday deal: Get one year of access for only $36",
          "standfirst": "HBO Max has launched its latest offer, giving new subscribers one year of streaming for $36 through December 1. The deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. It’s a rare opportunity to explore HBO Max’s mix of originals, Warner Bros. films and live sports while paying less than usual. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

          "title": "A weekend ‘vibe code’ hack by Andrej Karpathy quietly sketches the missing layer of enterprise AI orchestration",
          "standfirst": "This weekend, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, decided he wanted to read a book. But he did not want to read it alone. He wanted to read it accompanied by a committee of artificial intelligences, each offering its own perspective, critiquing the others, and eventually synthesizing a final answer under the guidance of a \"Chairman.\"To make this happen, Karpathy wrote what he called a \"vibe code project\" — a piece of software written quickly, largely by AI assistants, intended for fun rather than function. He posted the result, a repository called \"LLM Council,\" to GitHub with a stark disclaimer: \"I’m not going to support it in any way... Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over.\"Yet, for technical decision-makers across the enterprise landscape, looking past the casual disclaimer reveals something far more significant than a weekend toy. In a few hundred lines of Python and JavaScript, Karpathy has sketched a reference architecture for the most critical, undefined layer of the modern software stack: the orchestration middleware sitting between corporate applications and the volatile market of AI models.As companies finalize their platform investments for 2026, LLM Council offers a stripped-down look at the \"build vs. buy\" reality of AI infrastructure. It demonstrates that while the logic of routing and aggregating AI models is surprisingly simple, the operational wrapper required to make it enterprise-ready is where the true complexity lies.How the LLM Council works: Four AI models debate, critique, and synthesize answersTo the casual observer, the LLM Council web application looks almost identical to ChatGPT. A user types a query into a chat box. But behind the scenes, the application triggers a sophisticated, three-stage workflow that mirrors how human decision-making bodies operate.First, the system dispatches the user’s query to a panel of frontier models. In Karpathy’s default configuration, this includes OpenAI’s GPT-5.1, Google’s Gemini 3.0 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, and xAI’s Grok 4. These models generate their initial responses in parallel.In the second stage, the software performs a peer review. Each model is fed the anonymized responses of its counterparts and asked to evaluate them based on accuracy and insight. This step transforms the AI from a generator into a critic, forcing a layer of quality control that is rare in standard chatbot interactions.Finally, a designated \"Chairman LLM\" — currently configured as Google’s Gemini 3 — receives the original query, the individual responses, and the peer rankings. It synthesizes this mass of context into a single, authoritative answer for the user.Karpathy noted that the results were often surprising. \"Quite often, the models are surprisingly willing to select another LLM&#x27;s response as superior to their own,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). He described using the tool to read book chapters, observing that the models consistently praised GPT-5.1 as the most insightful while rating Claude the lowest. However, Karpathy’s own qualitative assessment diverged from his digital council; he found GPT-5.1 \"too wordy\" and preferred the \"condensed and processed\" output of Gemini.FastAPI, OpenRouter, and the case for treating frontier models as swappable componentsFor CTOs and platform architects, the value of LLM Council lies not in its literary criticism, but in its construction. The repository serves as a primary document showing exactly what a modern, minimal AI stack looks like in late 2025.The application is built on a \"thin\" architecture. The backend uses FastAPI, a modern Python framework, while the frontend is a standard React application built with Vite. Data storage is handled not by a complex database, but by simple JSON files written to the local disk.The linchpin of the entire operation is OpenRouter, an API aggregator that normalizes the differences between various model providers. By routing requests through this single broker, Karpathy avoided writing separate integration code for OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The application does not know or care which company provides the intelligence; it simply sends a prompt and awaits a response.This design choice highlights a growing trend in enterprise architecture: the commoditization of the model layer. By treating frontier models as interchangeable components that can be swapped by editing a single line in a configuration file — specifically the COUNCIL_MODELS list in the backend code — the architecture protects the application from vendor lock-in. If a new model from Meta or Mistral tops the leaderboards next week, it can be added to the council in seconds.What&#x27;s missing from prototype to production: Authentication, PII redaction, and complianceWhile the core logic of LLM Council is elegant, it also serves as a stark illustration of the gap between a \"weekend hack\" and a production system. For an enterprise platform team, cloning Karpathy’s repository is merely step one of a marathon.A technical audit of the code reveals the missing \"boring\" infrastructure that commercial vendors sell for premium prices. The system lacks authentication; anyone with access to the web interface can query the models. There is no concept of user roles, meaning a junior developer has the same access rights as the CIO.Furthermore, the governance layer is nonexistent. In a corporate environment, sending data to four different external AI providers simultaneously triggers immediate compliance concerns. There is no mechanism here to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before it leaves the local network, nor is there an audit log to track who asked what.Reliability is another open question. The system assumes the OpenRouter API is always up and that the models will respond in a timely fashion. It lacks the circuit breakers, fallback strategies, and retry logic that keep business-critical applications running when a provider suffers an outage.These absences are not flaws in Karpathy’s code — he explicitly stated he does not intend to support or improve the project — but they define the value proposition for the commercial AI infrastructure market.Companies like LangChain, AWS Bedrock, and various AI gateway startups are essentially selling the \"hardening\" around the core logic that Karpathy demonstrated. They provide the security, observability, and compliance wrappers that turn a raw orchestration script into a viable enterprise platform.Why Karpathy believes code is now \"ephemeral\" and traditional software libraries are obsoletePerhaps the most provocative aspect of the project is the philosophy under which it was built. Karpathy described the development process as \"99% vibe-coded,\" implying he relied heavily on AI assistants to generate the code rather than writing it line-by-line himself.\"Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like,\" he wrote in the repository’s documentation.This statement marks a radical shift in software engineering capability. Traditionally, companies build internal libraries and abstractions to manage complexity, maintaining them for years. Karpathy is suggesting a future where code is treated as \"promptable scaffolding\" — disposable, easily rewritten by AI, and not meant to last.For enterprise decision-makers, this poses a difficult strategic question. If internal tools can be \"vibe coded\" in a weekend, does it make sense to buy expensive, rigid software suites for internal workflows? Or should platform teams empower their engineers to generate custom, disposable tools that fit their exact needs for a fraction of the cost?When AI models judge AI: The dangerous gap between machine preferences and human needsBeyond the architecture, the LLM Council project inadvertently shines a light on a specific risk in automated AI deployment: the divergence between human and machine judgment.Karpathy’s observation that his models preferred GPT-5.1, while he preferred Gemini, suggests that AI models may have shared biases. They might favor verbosity, specific formatting, or rhetorical confidence that does not necessarily align with human business needs for brevity and accuracy.As enterprises increasingly rely on \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems to evaluate the quality of their customer-facing bots, this discrepancy matters. If the automated evaluator consistently rewards \"wordy and sprawled\" answers while human customers want concise solutions, the metrics will show success while customer satisfaction plummets. Karpathy’s experiment suggests that relying solely on AI to grade AI is a strategy fraught with hidden alignment issues.What enterprise platform teams can learn from a weekend hack before building their 2026 stackUltimately, LLM Council acts as a Rorschach test for the AI industry. For the hobbyist, it is a fun way to read books. For the vendor, it is a threat, proving that the core functionality of their products can be replicated in a few hundred lines of code.But for the enterprise technology leader, it is a reference architecture. It demystifies the orchestration layer, showing that the technical challenge is not in routing the prompts, but in governing the data.As platform teams head into 2026, many will likely find themselves staring at Karpathy’s code, not to deploy it, but to understand it. It proves that a multi-model strategy is not technically out of reach. The question remains whether companies will build the governance layer themselves or pay someone else to wrap the \"vibe code\" in enterprise-grade armor.",

In particular, we're recommending the DJI Neo drone, which is down to $159 on Amazon for Prime members only. That's 20 percent off and a great deal, considering its regular price is $200. The DJI Neo was recently pushed off our list of the best drones in favor of the newer Neo 2, but the original is still a fantastic, budget-friendly option. We called it the \"best $200 drone ever made\" in our official review, and with good reason. It's quick, ultra-maneuverable and beginner-friendly. The learning curve here isn't that steep. It boasts four propeller guards, for safety, and the built-in 4K camera certainly gets the job done. It's extremely light, weighing just 135 grams. This makes it easy to transport, sure, but also means that the Neo is exempt from drone license requirements. This version doesn't ship with a dedicated controller, though there is a combo pack for that, but that doesn't really matter here. The Neo can be maneuvered by hand gestures, human voice, mobile app or standard RC controller.

The 128GB Meta Quest 3S is 17 percent off in an early Black Friday deal, bringing it to a record-low price of $250. It normally goes for $300. With the purchase, you also get the game Gorilla Tag for free. The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a 90 in Engadget's review, landing it among our picks for the best VR headsets around right now. It's comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn't quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM. The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience.

Sony's A7 IV, which I said has \"the best combination of image quality, performance and video powers\" is on sale for $1,998, or 26 percent off the regular price. And the A7R V, which shoots beautiful 61MP images and offers fast and accurate autofocus, has hit at an all-time low of $3,298 or 21 percent ($898) off. With a superb score of 90 in my review, Sony's A7 IV is still one of the best hybrid cameras you can get thanks to the high resolution, fast shooting speeds and 4K 60p video. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and it comes with in-body stabilization to help smooth your shots. And for photographers, image quality has never been better thanks to the high dynamic range and enhanced resolution compared to the previous model. Although it does see occasional discounts, I've never seen it drop below $2,000, so if you've been looking, now is a perfect time to buy. Sony's A7R V garnered a similarly superb Engadget review. With a 61-megapixel sensor, it shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap. Again, there's never been a better time to buy one, as Sony told me this is the lowest price it has ever been sold at.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a new iPad at a lower price, this might be the time. The iPad A16 is on sale for $274 thanks to Black Friday, which is a solid drop from its usual list price. It’s the best budget tablet in Apple’s lineup and a great pick for streaming, note-taking or browsing without spending Pro-level money. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $274, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

You can get a Sling Orange Day Pass for just $1 through November 30, and get access to 34 channels, including ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3. Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV's interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you're likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sling-orange-day-passes-drop-to-1-each-with-this-black-friday-streaming-deal-231208021.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The AirPods Pro 3 are now on sale for $220, marking the biggest discount since launch. That’s a solid price for Apple’s newest earbuds, which bring improved sound, longer battery life and upgraded noise cancellation in a familiar, comfortable design. Previously, the lowest we saw Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 go down to was $239. This is a deal worth considering, as we can’t guarantee they’ll be discounted further anytime soon. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $100 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $69. If you prefer over-ear headphones, select colors of the AirPods Max are down to $400.

          "standfirst": "It&#x27;s not just Google&#x27;s Gemini 3, Nano Banana Pro, and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 we have to be thankful for this year around the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S.No, today the German AI startup Black Forest Labs released FLUX.2, a new image generation and editing system complete with four different models designed to support production-grade creative workflows.FLUX.2 introduces multi-reference conditioning, higher-fidelity outputs, and improved text rendering, and it expands the company’s open-core ecosystem with both commercial endpoints and open-weight checkpoints. While Black Forest Labs previously launched with and made a name for itself on open source text-to-image models in its Flux family, today&#x27;s release includes one fully open-source component: the Flux.2 VAE, available now under the Apache 2.0 license.Four other models of varying size and uses — Flux.2 [Pro], Flux.2 [Flex], and Flux.2 [Dev] —are not open source; Pro and Flex remain proprietary hosted offerings, while Dev is an open-weight downloadable model that requires a commercial license obtained directly from Black Forest Labs for any commercial use. An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows. Standardizing on a transparent, Apache-licensed VAE supports auditability and compliance requirements, ensures consistent reconstruction quality across internal assets, and allows future models trained for the same latent space to function as drop-in replacements.This transparency also enables downstream customization such as lightweight fine-tuning for brand styles or internal visual templates—even for organizations that do not specialize in media but rely on consistent, controllable image generation for marketing materials, product imagery, documentation, or stock-style visuals. The announcement positions FLUX.2 as an evolution of the FLUX.1 family, with an emphasis on reliability, controllability, and integration into existing creative pipelines rather than one-off demos.A Shift Toward Production-Centric Image ModelsFLUX.2 extends the prior FLUX.1 architecture with more consistent character, layout, and style adherence across up to ten reference images. The system maintains coherence at 4-megapixel resolutions for both generation and editing tasks, enabling use cases such as product visualization, brand-aligned asset creation, and structured design workflows. The model also improves prompt following across multi-part instructions while reducing failure modes related to lighting, spatial logic, and world knowledge.In parallel, Black Forest Labs continues to follow an open-core release strategy. The company provides hosted, performance-optimized versions of FLUX.2 for commercial deployments, while also publishing inspectable open-weight models that researchers and independent developers can run locally. This approach extends a track record begun with FLUX.1, which became the most widely used open image model globally.Model Variants and Deployment OptionsFlux.2 arrives with 5 variants as follows:Flux.2 [Pro]: This is the highest-performance tier, intended for applications that require minimal latency and maximal visual fidelity. It is available through the BFL Playground, the FLUX API, and partner platforms. The model aims to match leading closed-weight systems in prompt adherence and image quality while reducing compute demand.Flux.2 [Flex]: This version exposes parameters such as the number of sampling steps and the guidance scale. The design enables developers to tune the trade-offs between speed, text accuracy, and detail fidelity. In practice, this enables workflows where low-step previews can be generated quickly before higher-step renders are invoked.Flux.2 [Dev]: The most notable release for the open ecosystem is the 32-billion-parameter open-weight checkpoint which integrates text-to-image generation and image editing into a single model. It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.Flux.2 [Klein]: Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.Flux.2 – VAE: Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license, updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. Benchmark PerformanceBlack Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana ProA pricing calculator on BFL’s site indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka \"Nano Banana Pro,\" currently prices image output at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs. While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.Technical Design and the Latent Space OverhaulFLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.Capabilities Across Creative WorkflowsThe most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.Ecosystem and Open-Core StrategyBlack Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest LabsBlack Forest Labs (BFL) was founded in 2024 by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.BFL’s first major release, FLUX.1, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.In late 2024, BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision MakersThe FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.",

It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.Flux.2 [Klein]: Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.Flux.2 – VAE: Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license, updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. Benchmark PerformanceBlack Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana ProA pricing calculator on BFL’s site indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka \"Nano Banana Pro,\" currently prices image output at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs. While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.Technical Design and the Latent Space OverhaulFLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.Capabilities Across Creative WorkflowsThe most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.Ecosystem and Open-Core StrategyBlack Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest LabsBlack Forest Labs (BFL) was founded in 2024 by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.BFL’s first major release, FLUX.1, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.In late 2024, BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision MakersThe FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.",

          "standfirst": "Researchers at Alibaba’s Tongyi Lab have developed a new framework for self-evolving agents that create their own training data by exploring their application environments. The framework, AgentEvolver, uses the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models for autonomous learning, addressing the high costs and manual effort typically required to gather task-specific datasets.Experiments show that compared to traditional reinforcement learning–based frameworks, AgentEvolver is more efficient at exploring its environment, makes better use of data, and adapts faster to application environments. For the enterprise, this is significant because it lowers the barrier to training agents for bespoke applications, making powerful, custom AI assistants more accessible to a wider range of organizations.The high cost of training AI agentsReinforcement learning has become a major paradigm for training LLMs to act as agents that can interact with digital environments and learn from feedback. However, developing agents with RL faces fundamental challenges. First, gathering the necessary training datasets is often prohibitively expensive, requiring significant manual labor to create examples of tasks, especially in novel or proprietary software environments where there are no available off-the-shelf datasets.Second, the RL techniques commonly used for LLMs require the model to run through a massive number of trial-and-error attempts to learn effectively. This process is computationally costly and inefficient. As a result, training capable LLM agents through RL remains laborious and expensive, limiting their deployment in custom enterprise settings.How AgentEvolver worksThe main idea behind AgentEvolver is to give models greater autonomy in their own learning process. The researchers describe it as a “self-evolving agent system” designed to “achieve autonomous and efficient capability evolution through environmental interaction.” It uses the reasoning power of an LLM to create a self-training loop, allowing the agent to continuously improve by directly interacting with its target environment without needing predefined tasks or reward functions.“We envision an agent system where the LLM actively guides exploration, task generation, and performance refinement,” the researchers wrote in their paper.The self-evolution process is driven by three core mechanisms that work together.The first is self-questioning, where the agent explores its environment to discover the boundaries of its functions and identify useful states. It’s like a new user clicking around an application to see what’s possible. Based on this exploration, the agent generates its own diverse set of tasks that align with a user’s general preferences. This reduces the need for handcrafted datasets and allows the agent and its tasks to co-evolve, progressively enabling it to handle more complex challenges. According to Yunpeng Zhai, researcher at Alibaba and co-author of the paper, who spoke to VentureBeat, the self-questioning mechanism effectively turns the model from a “data consumer into a data producer,” dramatically reducing the time and cost required to deploy an agent in a proprietary environment.The second mechanism is self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency by reusing and generalizing from past experiences. AgentEvolver extracts insights from both successful and unsuccessful attempts and uses them to guide future actions. For example, if an agent tries to use an API function that doesn&#x27;t exist in an application, it registers this as an experience and learns to verify the existence of functions before attempting to use them in the future.The third mechanism, self-attributing, enhances learning efficiency by providing more detailed feedback. Instead of just a final success or failure signal (a common practice in RL that can result in sparse rewards), this mechanism uses an LLM to assess the contribution of each individual action in a multi-step task. It retrospectively determines whether each step contributed positively or negatively to the final outcome, giving the agent fine-grained feedback that accelerates learning. This is crucial for regulated industries where how an agent solves a problem is as important as the result. “Instead of rewarding a student only for the final answer, we also evaluate the clarity and correctness of each step in their reasoning,” Zhai explained. This improves transparency and encourages the agent to adopt more robust and auditable problem-solving patterns.“By shifting the training initiative from human-engineered pipelines to LLM-guided self-improvement, AgentEvolver establishes a new paradigm that paves the way toward scalable, cost-effective, and continually improving intelligent systems,” the researchers state.The team has also developed a practical, end-to-end training framework that integrates these three mechanisms. A key part of this foundation is the Context Manager, a component that controls the agent&#x27;s memory and interaction history. While today&#x27;s benchmarks test a limited number of tools, real enterprise environments can involve thousands of APIs. Zhai acknowledges this is a core challenge for the field, but notes that AgentEvolver was designed to be extended. “Retrieval over extremely large action spaces will always introduce computational challenges, but AgentEvolver’s architecture provides a clear path toward scalable tool reasoning in enterprise settings,” he said.A more efficient path to agent trainingTo measure the effectiveness of their framework, the researchers tested it on AppWorld and BFCL v3, two benchmarks that require agents to perform long, multi-step tasks using external tools. They used models from Alibaba’s Qwen2.5 family (7B and 14B parameters) and compared their performance against a baseline model trained with GRPO, a popular RL technique used to develop reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1.The results showed that integrating all three mechanisms in AgentEvolver led to substantial performance gains. For the 7B model, the average score improved by 29.4%, and for the 14B model, it increased by 27.8% over the baseline. The framework consistently enhanced the models&#x27; reasoning and task-execution capabilities across both benchmarks. The most significant improvement came from the self-questioning module, which autonomously generates diverse training tasks and directly addresses the data scarcity problem.The experiments also demonstrated that AgentEvolver can efficiently synthesize a large volume of high-quality training data. The tasks generated by the self-questioning module proved diverse enough to achieve good training efficiency even with a small amount of data. For enterprises, this provides a path to creating agents for bespoke applications and internal workflows while minimizing the need for manual data annotation. By providing high-level goals and letting the agent generate its own training experiences, organizations can develop custom AI assistants more simply and cost-effectively.“This combination of algorithmic design and engineering pragmatics positions AgentEvolver as both a research vehicle and a reusable foundation for building adaptive, tool-augmented agents,” the researchers conclude.Looking ahead, the ultimate goal is much bigger. “A truly ‘singular model’ that can drop into any software environment and master it overnight is certainly the holy grail of agentic AI,” Zhai said. “We see AgentEvolver as a necessary step in that direction.” While that future still requires breakthroughs in model reasoning and infrastructure, self-evolving approaches are paving the way.",

          "title": "What enterprises should know about The White House's new AI 'Manhattan Project' the Genesis Mission",
          "standfirst": "President Donald Trump’s new “Genesis Mission” unveiled Monday, November 24, 2025, is billed as a generational leap in how the United States does science akin to the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb during World War II. The executive order directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to build a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform” that links the country’s 17 national laboratories, federal supercomputers, and decades of government scientific data into “one cooperative system for research.” The White House fact sheet casts the initiative as a way to “transform how scientific research is conducted” and “accelerate the speed of scientific discovery,” with priorities spanning biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion, quantum information science, and semiconductors. DOE’s own release calls it “the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built” and quotes Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil describing it as a “closed-loop system” linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into “an engine for discovery that doubles R&D productivity.”The text of the order outlines mandatory steps DOE must complete within 60, 90, 120, 240, and 270 days—including identifying all Federal and partner compute resources, cataloging datasets and model assets, assessing robotic laboratory infrastructure across national labs, and demonstrating an initial operating capability for at least one scientific challenge within nine months.The DOE’s own Genesis Mission website adds important context: the initiative is launching with a broad coalition of private-sector, nonprofit, academic, and utility collaborators. The list spans multiple sectors—from advanced materials to aerospace to cloud computing—and includes participants such as Albemarle, Applied Materials, Collins Aerospace, GE Aerospace, Micron, PMT Critical Metals, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. That breadth signals DOE’s intent to position Genesis not just as an internal research overhaul but as a national industrial effort connected to manufacturing, energy infrastructure, and scientific supply chains.The collaborator list also includes many of the most influential AI and compute firms in the United States: OpenAI for Government, Anthropic, Scale AI, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AWS, IBM, Cerebras, HPE, Hugging Face, and Dell Technologies. The DOE frames Genesis as a national-scale instrument — a single “intelligent network,\" an “end-to-end discovery engine,” one intended to generate new classes of high-fidelity data, accelerate experimental cycles, and reduce research timelines from “years to months.” The agency casts the mission as foundational infrastructure for the next era of American science.Taken together, the roster outlines the technical backbone likely to shape the mission’s early development—hardware vendors, hyperscale cloud providers, frontier-model developers, and orchestration-layer companies. DOE does not describe these entities as contractors or beneficiaries, but their inclusion demonstrates that private-sector technical capacity will play a defining role in building and operating the Genesis platform.What the administration has not provided is just as striking: no public cost estimate, no explicit appropriation, and no breakdown of who will pay for what. Major news outlets including Reuters, Associated Press, Politico, and others have all noted that the order “does not specify new spending or a budget request,” or that funding will depend on future appropriations and previously passed legislation. That omission, combined with the initiative’s scope and timing, raises questions not only about how Genesis will be funded and to what extent, but about who it might quietly benefit.“So is this just a subsidy for big labs or what?”Soon after DOE promoted the mission on X, Teknium of the small U.S. AI lab Nous Research posted a blunt reaction: “So is this just a subsidy for big labs or what.” The line has become a shorthand for a growing concern in the AI community: that the U.S. government could offer some sort of public subsidy for large AI firms facing staggering and rising compute and data costs.That concern is grounded in recent, well-sourced reporting on OpenAI’s finances and infrastructure commitments. Documents obtained and analyzed by tech public relations professional and AI critic Ed Zitron describe a cost structure that has exploded as the company has scaled models like GPT-4, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5.1. The Register has separately inferred from Microsoft quarterly earnings statements that OpenAI lost about $13.5 billion on $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 alone. Other outlets and analysts have highlighted projections that show tens of billions in annual losses later this decade if spending and revenue follow current trajectoriesBy contrast, Google DeepMind trained its recent Gemini 3 flagship LLM on the company’s own TPU hardware and in its own data centers, giving it a structural advantage in cost per training run and energy management, as covered in Google’s own technical blogs and subsequent financial reporting. Viewed against that backdrop, an ambitious federal project that promises to integrate “world-class supercomputers and datasets into a unified, closed-loop AI platform” and “power robotic laboratories” sounds, to some observers, like more than a pure science accelerator. It could, depending on how access is structured, also ease the capital bottlenecks facing private frontier-model labs.The aggressive DOE deadlines and the order’s requirement to build a national AI compute-and-experimentation stack amplify those questions: the government is now constructing something strikingly similar to what private labs have been spending billions to build for themselves.The order directs DOE to create standardized agreements governing model sharing, intellectual-property ownership, licensing rules, and commercialization pathways—effectively setting the legal and governance infrastructure needed for private AI companies to plug into the federal platform. While access is not guaranteed and pricing is not specified, the framework for deep public-private integration is now fully established.What the order does not do is guarantee those companies access, spell out subsidized pricing, or earmark public money for their training runs. Any claim that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google “just got access” to federal supercomputing or national-lab data is, at this point, an interpretation of how the framework could be used, not something the text actually promises.Furthermore, the executive order makes no mention of open-source model development — an omission that stands out in light of remarks last year from Vice President JD Vance, when, prior to assuming office and while serving as a Senator from Ohio and participating in a hearing, he warned against regulations designed to protect incumbent tech firms and was widely praised by open-source advocates.That silence is notable given Vance’s earlier testimony, which many in the AI community interpreted as support for open-source AI or, at minimum, skepticism of policies that entrench incumbent advantages. Genesis instead sketches a controlled-access ecosystem governed by classification rules, export controls, and federal vetting requirements—far from the open-source model some expected this administration to champion.Closed-loop discovery and “autonomous scientific agents”Another viral reaction came from AI influencer Chris (@chatgpt21 on X), who wrote in an X post that that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have already “got access to petabytes of proprietary data” from national labs, and that DOE labs have been “hoarding experimental data for decades.” The public record supports a narrower claim.The order and fact sheet describe “federal scientific datasets—the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments” and direct agencies to identify data that can be integrated into the platform “to the extent permitted by law.” DOE’s announcement similarly talks about unleashing “the full power of our National Laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources.” It is true that the national labs hold enormous troves of experimental data. Some of it is already public via the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and other repositories; some is classified or export-controlled; much is under-used because it sits in fragmented formats and systems. But there is no public document so far that states private AI companies have now been granted blanket access to this data, or that DOE characterizes past practice as “hoarding.”What is clear is that the administration wants to unlock more of this data for AI-driven research and to do so in coordination with external partners. Section 5 of the order instructs DOE and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology to create standardized partnership frameworks, define IP and licensing rules, and set “stringent data access and management processes and cybersecurity standards for non-Federal collaborators accessing datasets, models, and computing environments.”Equally notable is the national-security framing woven throughout the order. Multiple sections invoke classification rules, export controls, supply-chain security, and vetting requirements that place Genesis at the junction of open scientific inquiry and restricted national-security operations. Access to the platform will be mediated through federal security norms rather than open-science principles.A moonshot with an open question at the centerTaken at face value, the Genesis Mission is an ambitious attempt to use AI and high-performance computing to speed up everything from fusion research to materials discovery and pediatric cancer work, using decades of taxpayer-funded data and instruments that already exist inside the federal system. The executive order spends considerable space on governance: coordination through the National Science and Technology Council, new fellowship programs, and annual reporting on platform status, integration progress, partnerships, and scientific outcomes. The order also codifies, for the first time, the development of AI agents capable of generating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting results, and directing robotic laboratories—an explicit embrace of automated scientific discovery and a significant departure from prior U.S. science directives.Yet the initiative also lands at a moment when frontline AI labs are buckling under their own compute bills, when one of them—OpenAI—is reported to be spending more on running models than it earns in revenue, and when investors are openly debating whether the current business model for proprietary frontier AI is sustainable without some form of outside support.In that environment, a federally funded, closed-loop AI discovery platform that centralizes the country’s most powerful supercomputers and data is inevitably going to be read in more than one way. It may become a genuine engine for public science. It may also become a crucial piece of infrastructure for the very companies driving today’s AI arms race.Standing up a platform of this scale—complete with robotic labs, synthetic data generation pipelines, multi-agency datasets, and industrial-grade AI agents—would typically require substantial, dedicated appropriations and a multi-year budget roadmap. Yet the order remains silent on cost, leaving observers to speculate whether the administration will repurpose existing resources, seek congressional appropriations later, or rely heavily on private-sector partnerships to build the platform.For now, one fact is undeniable: the administration has launched a mission it compares to the Manhattan Project without telling the public what it will cost, how the money will flow, or exactly who will be allowed to plug into it. How enterprise tech leaders should interpret the Genesis MissionFor enterprise teams already building or scaling AI systems, the Genesis Mission signals a shift in how national infrastructure, data governance, and high-performance compute will evolve in the U.S.—and those signals matter even before the government publishes a budget. The initiative outlines a federated, AI-driven scientific ecosystem where supercomputers, datasets, and automated experimentation loops operate as tightly integrated pipelines. That direction mirrors the trajectory many companies are already moving toward: larger models, more experimentation, heavier orchestration, and a growing need for systems that can manage complex workloads with reliability and traceability.Even though Genesis is aimed at science, its architecture hints at what will become expected norms across American industries.The specificity of the order’s deadlines also signals where enterprise expectations may shift next: toward standardized metadata, provenance tracking, multi-cloud interoperability, AI pipeline observability, and rigorous access controls. As DOE operationalizes Genesis, enterprises—particularly in regulated sectors such as biotech, energy, pharmaceuticals, and advanced manufacturing—may find themselves evaluated against emerging federal norms for data governance and AI-system integrity.The lack of cost detail around Genesis does not directly alter enterprise roadmaps, but it does reinforce the broader reality that compute scarcity, escalating cloud costs, and rising standards for AI model governance will remain central challenges. Companies that already struggle with constrained budgets or tight headcount—particularly those responsible for deployment pipelines, data integrity, or AI security—should view Genesis as early confirmation that efficiency, observability, and modular AI infrastructure will remain essential. As the federal government formalizes frameworks for data access, experiment traceability, and AI agent oversight, enterprises may find that future compliance regimes or partnership expectations take cues from these federal standards.Genesis also underscores the growing importance of unifying data sources and ensuring that models can operate across diverse, sometimes sensitive environments. Whether managing pipelines across multiple clouds, fine-tuning models with domain-specific datasets, or securing inference endpoints, enterprise technical leaders will likely see increased pressure to harden systems, standardize interfaces, and invest in complex orchestration that can scale safely. The mission’s emphasis on automation, robotic workflows, and closed-loop model refinement may shape how enterprises structure their internal AI R&D, encouraging them to adopt more repeatable, automated, and governable approaches to experimentation. In this sense, Genesis may serve as an early signal of how national-level AI infrastructure is likely to influence private-sector requirements, especially for companies operating in critical industries or scientific supply chains.Here is what enterprise leaders should be doing now:Expect increased federal involvement in AI infrastructure and data governance. This may indirectly shape cloud availability, interoperability standards, and model-governance expectations.Track “closed-loop” AI experimentation models. This may preview future enterprise R&D workflows and reshape how ML teams build automated pipelines.Prepare for rising compute costs and consider efficiency strategies. This includes smaller models, retrieval-augmented systems, and mixed-precision training.Strengthen AI-specific security practices. Genesis signals that the federal government is escalating expectations for AI system integrity and controlled access.Plan for potential public–private interoperability standards. Enterprises that align early may gain a competitive edge in partnerships and procurement.Overall, Genesis does not change day-to-day enterprise AI operations today. But it strongly signals where federal and scientific AI infrastructure is heading—and that direction will inevitably influence the expectations, constraints, and opportunities enterprises face as they scale their own AI capabilities.",
          "content": "President Donald Trump’s new “Genesis Mission” unveiled Monday, November 24, 2025, is billed as a generational leap in how the United States does science akin to the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb during World War II. The executive order directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to build a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform” that links the country’s 17 national laboratories, federal supercomputers, and decades of government scientific data into “one cooperative system for research.” The White House fact sheet casts the initiative as a way to “transform how scientific research is conducted” and “accelerate the speed of scientific discovery,” with priorities spanning biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion, quantum information science, and semiconductors. DOE’s own release calls it “the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built” and quotes Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil describing it as a “closed-loop system” linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into “an engine for discovery that doubles R&D productivity.”The text of the order outlines mandatory steps DOE must complete within 60, 90, 120, 240, and 270 days—including identifying all Federal and partner compute resources, cataloging datasets and model assets, assessing robotic laboratory infrastructure across national labs, and demonstrating an initial operating capability for at least one scientific challenge within nine months.The DOE’s own Genesis Mission website adds important context: the initiative is launching with a broad coalition of private-sector, nonprofit, academic, and utility collaborators. The list spans multiple sectors—from advanced materials to aerospace to cloud computing—and includes participants such as Albemarle, Applied Materials, Collins Aerospace, GE Aerospace, Micron, PMT Critical Metals, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. That breadth signals DOE’s intent to position Genesis not just as an internal research overhaul but as a national industrial effort connected to manufacturing, energy infrastructure, and scientific supply chains.The collaborator list also includes many of the most influential AI and compute firms in the United States: OpenAI for Government, Anthropic, Scale AI, Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AWS, IBM, Cerebras, HPE, Hugging Face, and Dell Technologies. The DOE frames Genesis as a national-scale instrument — a single “intelligent network,\" an “end-to-end discovery engine,” one intended to generate new classes of high-fidelity data, accelerate experimental cycles, and reduce research timelines from “years to months.” The agency casts the mission as foundational infrastructure for the next era of American science.Taken together, the roster outlines the technical backbone likely to shape the mission’s early development—hardware vendors, hyperscale cloud providers, frontier-model developers, and orchestration-layer companies. DOE does not describe these entities as contractors or beneficiaries, but their inclusion demonstrates that private-sector technical capacity will play a defining role in building and operating the Genesis platform.What the administration has not provided is just as striking: no public cost estimate, no explicit appropriation, and no breakdown of who will pay for what. Major news outlets including Reuters, Associated Press, Politico, and others have all noted that the order “does not specify new spending or a budget request,” or that funding will depend on future appropriations and previously passed legislation. That omission, combined with the initiative’s scope and timing, raises questions not only about how Genesis will be funded and to what extent, but about who it might quietly benefit.“So is this just a subsidy for big labs or what?”Soon after DOE promoted the mission on X, Teknium of the small U.S. AI lab Nous Research posted a blunt reaction: “So is this just a subsidy for big labs or what.” The line has become a shorthand for a growing concern in the AI community: that the U.S. government could offer some sort of public subsidy for large AI firms facing staggering and rising compute and data costs.That concern is grounded in recent, well-sourced reporting on OpenAI’s finances and infrastructure commitments. Documents obtained and analyzed by tech public relations professional and AI critic Ed Zitron describe a cost structure that has exploded as the company has scaled models like GPT-4, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5.1. The Register has separately inferred from Microsoft quarterly earnings statements that OpenAI lost about $13.5 billion on $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 alone. Other outlets and analysts have highlighted projections that show tens of billions in annual losses later this decade if spending and revenue follow current trajectoriesBy contrast, Google DeepMind trained its recent Gemini 3 flagship LLM on the company’s own TPU hardware and in its own data centers, giving it a structural advantage in cost per training run and energy management, as covered in Google’s own technical blogs and subsequent financial reporting. Viewed against that backdrop, an ambitious federal project that promises to integrate “world-class supercomputers and datasets into a unified, closed-loop AI platform” and “power robotic laboratories” sounds, to some observers, like more than a pure science accelerator. It could, depending on how access is structured, also ease the capital bottlenecks facing private frontier-model labs.The aggressive DOE deadlines and the order’s requirement to build a national AI compute-and-experimentation stack amplify those questions: the government is now constructing something strikingly similar to what private labs have been spending billions to build for themselves.The order directs DOE to create standardized agreements governing model sharing, intellectual-property ownership, licensing rules, and commercialization pathways—effectively setting the legal and governance infrastructure needed for private AI companies to plug into the federal platform. While access is not guaranteed and pricing is not specified, the framework for deep public-private integration is now fully established.What the order does not do is guarantee those companies access, spell out subsidized pricing, or earmark public money for their training runs. Any claim that OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google “just got access” to federal supercomputing or national-lab data is, at this point, an interpretation of how the framework could be used, not something the text actually promises.Furthermore, the executive order makes no mention of open-source model development — an omission that stands out in light of remarks last year from Vice President JD Vance, when, prior to assuming office and while serving as a Senator from Ohio and participating in a hearing, he warned against regulations designed to protect incumbent tech firms and was widely praised by open-source advocates.That silence is notable given Vance’s earlier testimony, which many in the AI community interpreted as support for open-source AI or, at minimum, skepticism of policies that entrench incumbent advantages. Genesis instead sketches a controlled-access ecosystem governed by classification rules, export controls, and federal vetting requirements—far from the open-source model some expected this administration to champion.Closed-loop discovery and “autonomous scientific agents”Another viral reaction came from AI influencer Chris (@chatgpt21 on X), who wrote in an X post that that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have already “got access to petabytes of proprietary data” from national labs, and that DOE labs have been “hoarding experimental data for decades.” The public record supports a narrower claim.The order and fact sheet describe “federal scientific datasets—the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments” and direct agencies to identify data that can be integrated into the platform “to the extent permitted by law.” DOE’s announcement similarly talks about unleashing “the full power of our National Laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources.” It is true that the national labs hold enormous troves of experimental data. Some of it is already public via the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and other repositories; some is classified or export-controlled; much is under-used because it sits in fragmented formats and systems. But there is no public document so far that states private AI companies have now been granted blanket access to this data, or that DOE characterizes past practice as “hoarding.”What is clear is that the administration wants to unlock more of this data for AI-driven research and to do so in coordination with external partners. Section 5 of the order instructs DOE and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology to create standardized partnership frameworks, define IP and licensing rules, and set “stringent data access and management processes and cybersecurity standards for non-Federal collaborators accessing datasets, models, and computing environments.”Equally notable is the national-security framing woven throughout the order. Multiple sections invoke classification rules, export controls, supply-chain security, and vetting requirements that place Genesis at the junction of open scientific inquiry and restricted national-security operations. Access to the platform will be mediated through federal security norms rather than open-science principles.A moonshot with an open question at the centerTaken at face value, the Genesis Mission is an ambitious attempt to use AI and high-performance computing to speed up everything from fusion research to materials discovery and pediatric cancer work, using decades of taxpayer-funded data and instruments that already exist inside the federal system.

This was close to impossible through the spring and summer. But it’s not a good time to build a new PC or swap your older motherboard out for a new one that needs DDR5 RAM. And the culprit is a shortage of RAM and flash memory chips that has suddenly sent SSD and (especially) memory prices into the stratosphere, caused primarily by the ongoing AI boom and exacerbated by panic-fueled buying by end users and device manufacturers. To illustrate just how high things have jumped in a short amount of time, let’s compare some of the RAM and storage prices listed in our system guide from three months ago to the pricing for the exact same components today.

          "content": "Worries about the US grid’s ability to handle the surge in demand due to data center growth have made headlines repeatedly over the course of 2025. And, early in the year, demand for electricity had surged by nearly 5 percent compared to the year prior, suggesting the grid might truly be facing a data center apocalypse. And that rise in demand had a very unfortunate effect: Coal use rose for the first time since its recent collapse began. But since the first-quarter data was released, demand has steadily eroded. As of yesterday’s data release by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which covers the first nine months of 2025, total electricity demand has risen by 2.3 percent. That slowdown means that most of the increased demand could have been met by the astonishing growth of solar power. Better than feared If you look over data on the first quarter of 2025, the numbers are pretty grim, with total demand rising by 4.8 percent compared to the same period in the year prior. While solar power continued its remarkable surge, growing by an astonishing 44 percent, it was only able to cover a third of the demand growth. As a result of that and a drop in natural gas usage, coal use grew by 23 percent.Read full article Comments",

The earliest look at OpenAI’s strategy to overcome the string of lawsuits came in a case where parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine accused OpenAI of relaxing safety guardrails that allowed ChatGPT to become the teen’s “suicide coach.” OpenAI deliberately designed the version their son used, ChatGPT 4o, to encourage and validate his suicidal ideation in its quest to build the world’s most engaging chatbot, parents argued. But in a blog, OpenAI claimed that parents selectively chose disturbing chat logs while supposedly ignoring “the full picture” revealed by the teen’s chat history. Digging through the logs, OpenAI claimed the teen told ChatGPT that he’d begun experiencing suicidal ideation at age 11, long before he used the chatbot.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham as its new principal deputy director—a choice that was immediately called “dangerous” and “irresponsible,” yet not as bad as it could have been, by experts. Physician Jeremy Faust revealed the appointment in his newsletter Inside Medicine yesterday, which was subsequently confirmed by journalists. Faust noted that a CDC source told him, “I heard way worse names floated,” and although Abraham’s views are “probably pretty terrible,” he at least has had relevant experience running a public health system, unlike other current leaders of the agency. But Abraham hasn’t exactly been running a health system the way most public health experts would recommend. Under Abraham’s leadership, the Louisiana health department waited months to inform residents about a deadly whooping cough (pertussis) outbreak. He also has a clear record of anti-vaccine views. Earlier this year, he told a Louisiana news outlet he doesn’t recommend COVID-19 vaccines because “I prefer natural immunity.” In February, he ordered the health department to stop promoting mass vaccinations, including flu shots, and barred staff from running seasonal vaccine campaigns.Read full article Comments",

People have worked to identify the genes associated with many of these behaviors, taking advantage of the fact that dogs can interbreed. But that creates its own experimental challenges, as it can be difficult to separate some behaviors from physical traits distinctive to the breed—small dog breeds may seem more aggressive simply because they feel threatened more often. To get around that, a team of researchers recently did the largest gene/behavior association study within a single dog breed. Taking advantage of a population of over 1,000 golden retrievers, they found a number of genes associated with behaviors within that breed. A high percentage of these genes turned out to correspond to regions of the human genome that have been associated with behavioral differences as well. But, in many cases, these associations have been with very different behaviors. Gone to the dogs The work, done by a team based largely at Cambridge University, utilized the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study, which involved over 3,000 owners of these dogs filling out annual surveys that included information on their dogs’ behavior. Over 1,000 of those owners also had blood samples obtained from their dogs and shipped in; the researchers used these samples to scan the dogs’ genomes for variants. Those were then compared to ratings of the dogs’ behavior on a range of issues, like fear or aggression directed toward strangers or other dogs.Read full article Comments",

An analysis published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine found that most participants in a clinical trial who were assigned to stop taking tirzepatide (Zepbound from Eli Lilly) not only regained significant amounts of the weight they had lost on the drug, but they also saw their cardiovascular and metabolic improvements slip away. Their blood pressure went back up, as did their cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c (used to assess glucose control levels), and fasting insulin. In an accompanying editorial, two medical experts at the University of Pittsburgh, Elizabeth Oczypok and Timothy Anderson, suggest that this new class of drugs should be rebranded from “weight loss” drugs to “weight management” drugs, which people may need to take indefinitely.Read full article Comments",

Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules announced in March, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a Remote Watch Pass, which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2/month starting price. Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent Plex forums post by a Plex employee that How-To Geek spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access.

A Long March 2F rocket fired its engines and lifted off with the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft, carrying cargo instead of a crew, at 11:11 pm EST Monday (04:11 UTC Tuesday). The spacecraft docked with the Tiangong station nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth about three-and-a-half hours later. Chinese engineers worked fast to move up the launch of the Shenzhou 22, originally set to fly next year. On November 4, astronauts discovered one of the two crew ferry ships docked to the Tiangong station had a damaged window, likely from an impact with a small fragment of space junk. The crew members used a microscope to photograph the defect from different angles, confirming a small triangular area with a crack, Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China’s human spaceflight program, told Chinese state media.Read full article Comments",

And Steam Machine owners should expect to pay roughly what they would for desktop hardware with similar specs, he added. “If you build a PC from parts and get to basically the same level of performance, that’s the general price window that we aim to be at,” Griffais said.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Our exploration of the outer Solar System has revealed a host of icy moons, many with surface features that suggest a complex geology. In some cases, these features—most notably the geysers of Enceladus—hint at the presence of oceans beneath the icy surfaces. These oceans have been ascribed to gravitational interactions that cause flexing and friction within the moon, creating enough heat to melt the body’s interior. Something that has received a bit less attention is that some of these orbital interactions are temporary or cyclical. The orbits of any body are not always regular and often have long-term cycles. That’s also true for the other moons that provide the gravitational stress. As a result, the internal oceans may actually come and go, as the interiors of the moons melt and refreeze. A new study, released today by Nature Astronomy, looks at one of the consequences of the difference in density between liquid water and ice (about 10 percent): the potential for the moon’s interior to shrink as it melts, leaving an area of low pressure immediately below its icy shell. If the moon is small enough, this study suggests, that could cause the surface of the ocean to boil.Read full article Comments",
