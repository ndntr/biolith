          "standfirst": "Joining the ranks of a growing number of smaller, powerful reasoning models is MiroThinker 1.5 from MiroMind, with just 30 billion parameters, compared to the hundreds of billions or trillions used by leading foundation large language models (LLMs).But MiroThinker 1.5 stands out among these smaller reasoners for one major reason: it offers agentic research capabilities rivaling trillion-parameter competitors like Kimi K2 and DeepSeek, at a fraction of the inference cost.The release marks a milestone in the push toward efficient, deployable AI agents. Enterprises have long been forced to choose between expensive API calls to frontier models or compromised local performance. MiroThinker 1.5 offers a third path: open-weight models architected specifically for extended tool use and multi-step reasoning.One of the biggest trends emerging in the industry is a move away from highly specialized agents toward more generalized ones. Until recently, that capability was largely limited to proprietary models. MiroThinker 1.5 represents a serious open-weight contender in this space. Watch my YouTube video on it below. Reduced Hallucination Risk Through Verifiable ReasoningFor IT teams evaluating AI deployment, hallucinations remain the primary barrier to using open models in production. MiroThinker 1.5 addresses this through what MiroMind calls “scientist mode”—a fundamental architectural shift in how the model handles uncertainty.Rather than generating statistically plausible answers from memorized patterns (the root cause of most hallucinations), MiroThinker is trained to execute a verifiable research loop: propose hypotheses, query external sources for evidence, identify mismatches, revise conclusions, and verify again. During training, the model is explicitly penalized for high-confidence outputs that lack source support.The practical implication for enterprise deployment is auditability. When MiroThinker produces an answer, it can surface both the reasoning chain and the external sources it consulted. For regulated industries such as financial services, healthcare, and legal, this creates a documentation trail that memorization-based models cannot provide. Compliance teams can review not just what the model concluded, but how it arrived there.This approach also reduces the “confident hallucination” problem common in production AI systems. The model is trained to seek verification rather than extrapolate when uncertain—a behavior that translates directly into fewer costly errors.Benchmark Performance: Punching Above Its WeightUnder this framework, MiroThinker-v1.5-30B delivers performance comparable to models with up to 30× more parameters, including the trillion-parameter Kimi-K2-Thinking model. On BrowseComp-ZH, a key benchmark for web research capabilities, the 30B model actually outperformed its trillion-parameter competitor with a score of 69.8.The cost differential is equally notable. MiroMind reports inference costs as low as $0.07 per call for the 30B variant—roughly one-twentieth the cost of Kimi-K2-Thinking—along with faster inference speeds.A larger 235B variant (with 22B active parameters in a mixture-of-experts architecture) ranks in the global top tier across multiple search-agent benchmarks. On general agentic search evaluations, these models hold their own against systems from DeepSeek V3.2, Minimax, GLM, and Kimi-K2.In testing, the larger model approaches Gemini 3 Pro on several benchmarks and comes closer to GPT-5-class systems than its parameter count might suggest. While benchmark hill-climbing is increasingly common, what matters more is overall competitiveness—and MiroThinker holds up well.Extended Tool Use: Up to 400 Tool Calls per SessionThe defining capability of MiroThinker 1.5 is sustained tool use.The models support up to 256,000 tokens of context and claim support for up to 400 tool calls per session—a critical requirement for complex research workflows involving extensive information gathering, synthesis, and cross-checking.This places MiroThinker firmly in the emerging category of agentic models designed for autonomous task completion rather than single-turn Q&A. Practical applications include deep research workflows, content pipelines, report generation, and podcast-style outputs similar to NotebookLM.Training Innovation: Time-Sensitive SandboxAnother major innovation in MiroThinker 1.5 is its Time-Sensitive Training Sandbox.Traditional model training operates from what MiroMind describes as a “God’s-eye view,” where the model has access to finalized outcomes within static datasets—creating hindsight bias. MiroThinker’s training removes that advantage.During training, the model can only interact with information published before a given timestamp, preventing future leakage and forcing it to reason under realistic conditions of incomplete information.The pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm popularized by DeepSeek,, encouraging the model to select the right tool at the right time.This approach is especially relevant for enterprise use cases where models must reason about evolving situations rather than recall static facts.Practical Deployment ConsiderationsFor IT teams considering deployment, hardware requirements still matter. Even the 30B model requires a substantial amount of GPU memory, and smaller setups may struggle.One advantage is compatibility. MiroThinker runs on vLLM servers with OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, making it easier to integrate into existing toolchains and function-calling workflows as a drop-in replacement.Both model sizes are available under the permissive, enterprise-friendly MIT license on Hugging Face, and an online demo is available for evaluation. The permissive license removes major barriers to internal deployment and fine-tuning.The Bigger Picture: Interactive Scaling vs. Parameter ScalingMiroThinker 1.5 arrives as the industry confronts the limits of traditional scaling laws. Bigger models no longer guarantee better real-world performance. As Artificial Analysis has noted, many benchmarks are saturated, pushing the industry toward evaluations based on economic usefulness rather than abstract reasoning alone.MiroMind’s bet is on interactive scaling—improving capability through deeper tool interaction rather than ever-larger parameter counts. If correct, this could enable sophisticated agents on infrastructure that does not depend on expensive frontier APIs.The company, founded by Tianqiao Chen and AI scientist Jifeng Dai, describes its mission as building “Native Intelligence”—AI that reasons through interaction, not memorization.Whether this approach becomes dominant or remains a specialized niche is still an open question. But for enterprises wrestling with cost-capability tradeoffs, MiroThinker 1.5 offers a compelling data point: sometimes, teaching a model how to research matters more than teaching it to remember everything.",

          "standfirst": "Right now in the AI world, there are a lot of percolating ideas and experimentation. But as far as Replit CEO Amjad Masad is concerned, they&#x27;re just \"toys\": unreliable, marginally effective, and generic. “There&#x27;s a lot of sameness out there,” Masad explains in a new VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “Everything kind of looks the same, all the images, all the code, everything.”This \"slop,\" as it’s come to be known, is not only the result of lazy one-shot prompting, but a lack of individual flavor. “The way to overcome slop is for the platform to expend more effort and for the developers of the platform to imbue the agent with taste,” Masad says.How Replit overcomes being generic Replit tackles the slop problem through a mix of specialized prompting, classification features built into its design systems, and proprietary RAG techniques. The team also isn’t hesitant to use more tokens; this results in higher-quality inputs, Masad notes. Ongoing testing is also critical. After the first generation of an app, Masad’s team kicks the result off to a testing agent, which analyzes all its features, then reports back to a coding agent about what worked (and didn’t). “If you introduce testing in the loop, you can give the model feedback and have the model reflect on its work,” Masad says. Pitting models against one another is another of Replit&#x27;s strategies: Testing agents may be built on one LLM, coding agents on another. This capitalizes on their different knowledge distributions. “That way the product you&#x27;re giving to the customer is high effort and less sloppy,” Masad says. “You generate more variety.” Ultimately, he describes a “push and pull” between what the model can actually do and what teams need to build on top of it to add value. Also, “if you wanna move fast and you wanna ship things, you need to throw away a lot of code,” he says. Why vibe coding is the future There’s still a lot of frustration around AI because, Masad acknowledges, it isn’t living up to the intense hype. Chatbots are well-established but they offer a “marginal improvement” in workflows. Vibe coding is beginning to take off partly because it&#x27;s the best way for companies to adopt AI in an impactful way, he notes. It can “make everyone in the enterprise the software engineer,” he says, allowing employees to solve problems and improve efficiency through automation, thus requiring less reliance on traditional SaaS tools. “I would say that the population of professional developers who studied computer science and trained as developers will shrink over time,” Masad says. On the flip side, the population of vibe coders who can solve problems with software and agents will grow “tremendously” over time. In the end, enterprises must fundamentally change how they think about software; traditional roadmaps are no longer relevant, Masad says. Because AI capabilities are evolving so dramatically, builders can only “roughly” estimate what things might look like months or even weeks into the future. Reflecting this reality, Replit’s team remains agile and isn’t hesitant to “drop everything” when a new model comes out to perform evals. “It&#x27;ll ebb and flow,” Masad contends. “You need to be very zen about it and not have an ego about it.” Listen to the full podcast to hear about: The “squishy” divide in AI intelligence that impedes specialization;The cathedral versus bazaar debate in open source — and why a “cathedral made of bazaars” may be the best path to collective innovation;How Replit “forks” the development environment to create isolated sandboxes for experimentation; The importance of context compression; What really defines AI agents: They don’t just retrieve information; they work autonomously, repeatedly, without human intervention.

          "title": "Samsung Display at CES 2026: Playful demos and mysterious prototypes",
          "standfirst": "Samsung Display is the part of its giant parent company that makes OLEDs, LCDs and other screens for both Samsung devices and anyone else that can afford them. This year, it’s going all-in on OLEDs of the future. And that meant things like foldable displays with invisible creases, robots hurling basketballs at supertough OLED panels, and OLED screens packed into baffling form factors for no good reason. Creases Samsung Display The “seamless” foldable display that might be a part of a future foldable iPhone disappeared from the booth during our tour, reappearing when it was time to leave. (This is an image provided by Samsung Display.) The device was labelled as an R&D concept, but it somehow disguised the crease in the center of the main display, making the (unlabelled) Galaxy Z Fold on the left look like a messy first-iteration foldable. There's still a crease there Will it actually form part of Apple’s foray into foldables, or just part of the Z Fold 8? Why not both? Put an OLED on it Mat Smith for Engadget This isn’t a record player you’ll ever buy. You don’t need an OLED display on the side of your wireless headphones, but you could have them. I liked the cute OLED pendants; a customizable near-future button badge, but a lot of this is just devices for the sake of making them. The booth tour had a small segment dedicated to portable gaming OLED, adding more possibilities whether that’s an eye-sight for FPS games or extra HUD for the most important info. The world’s brightest OLED TV Mat Smith for Engadget Reaching 4,500-nit brightness, I had to squint when sat in front of this beastly OLED. For reference, consumer-level TVs typically peak at around 2,700 nits. Compared to other display technologies, OLED can achieve deeper contrast and more accurate color reproduction, but it often lacks the brightness of rival TV technologies. Not for this prototype. Let me get my sunglasses. Kobe! Mat Smith for Engadget I didn’t consider OLED displays to be more fragile than other display technology, but that didn’t stop Samsung Display from installing a robot arm that throws a basketball at a hoop with a backboard made of 18 foldable OLEDs. With a bang, making Samsung Display execs and engineers nearby increasingly anxious as the days of CES go on. Foldables have come a long way Mat Smith for Engadget After Samsung finally solved the problem of weight and thickness with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it made life hard for itself again with the TriFold, with 50 percent more foldable screen. But it's worth seeing how Samsung’s foldables have evolved over the past few years. A solid reminder that the first Galaxy Fold (2019) was beefy. The next big thing in gaming displays Mat Smith for Engadget Samsung Display has begun mass production of its 360Hz QD-OLED panel, with new “V-Stripe” RGB pixel structures.

          "content": "Samsung Display is the part of its giant parent company that makes OLEDs, LCDs and other screens for both Samsung devices and anyone else that can afford them. This year, it’s going all-in on OLEDs of the future. And that meant things like foldable displays with invisible creases, robots hurling basketballs at supertough OLED panels, and OLED screens packed into baffling form factors for no good reason. Creases Samsung Display The “seamless” foldable display that might be a part of a future foldable iPhone disappeared from the booth during our tour, reappearing when it was time to leave. (This is an image provided by Samsung Display.) The device was labelled as an R&D concept, but it somehow disguised the crease in the center of the main display, making the (unlabelled) Galaxy Z Fold on the left look like a messy first-iteration foldable. There's still a crease there Will it actually form part of Apple’s foray into foldables, or just part of the Z Fold 8? Why not both? Put an OLED on it Mat Smith for Engadget This isn’t a record player you’ll ever buy. You don’t need an OLED display on the side of your wireless headphones, but you could have them. I liked the cute OLED pendants; a customizable near-future button badge, but a lot of this is just devices for the sake of making them. The booth tour had a small segment dedicated to portable gaming OLED, adding more possibilities whether that’s an eye-sight for FPS games or extra HUD for the most important info. The world’s brightest OLED TV Mat Smith for Engadget Reaching 4,500-nit brightness, I had to squint when sat in front of this beastly OLED. For reference, consumer-level TVs typically peak at around 2,700 nits. Compared to other display technologies, OLED can achieve deeper contrast and more accurate color reproduction, but it often lacks the brightness of rival TV technologies. Not for this prototype. Let me get my sunglasses. Kobe! Mat Smith for Engadget I didn’t consider OLED displays to be more fragile than other display technology, but that didn’t stop Samsung Display from installing a robot arm that throws a basketball at a hoop with a backboard made of 18 foldable OLEDs. With a bang, making Samsung Display execs and engineers nearby increasingly anxious as the days of CES go on. Foldables have come a long way Mat Smith for Engadget After Samsung finally solved the problem of weight and thickness with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it made life hard for itself again with the TriFold, with 50 percent more foldable screen. But it's worth seeing how Samsung’s foldables have evolved over the past few years. A solid reminder that the first Galaxy Fold (2019) was beefy. The next big thing in gaming displays Mat Smith for Engadget Samsung Display has begun mass production of its 360Hz QD-OLED panel, with new “V-Stripe” RGB pixel structures. Inside each pixel, subpixels are vertically aligned, which appears to improve the clarity of text edges and other small contrast objects. While it was framed at the booth as a boon for office workers, a corner was dedicated to gaming applications.

But one startup at CES is already showing off how the glasses can help power an intriguing set of accessibility features.Hapware has created Aleye, a haptic wristband that, when paired with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, can help people understand the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of the people they are talking to. The company says the device could help people who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent unlock a type of communication that otherwise wouldn't be available.Aleye is a somewhat chunky wristband that can vibrate in specific patterns on your wrist to correspond to the facial expressions and gestures of the person you're talking to. It uses the Meta Ray-Ban glasses's computer vision abilities to stream video of your conversation to the accompanying app, which uses an algorithm to detect facial expressions and gestures.The bumps on the underside of the Aleye vibrate to form unique patterns.Karissa Bell for EngadgetUsers can customize which expressions and gestures they want to detect in the app, which also provides a way for people to learn to distinguish between the different patterns. Hapware CEO Jack Walters said in their early testing people have been able to learn a handful of patterns within a few minutes. The company has also tried to make them intuitive. \"Jaw drop might feel like a jaw drop, a wave feels more like a side to side haptics,\" he explains.The app is also able to use Meta AI to give vocal cues about people's expressions, though Hapware's CTO Dr. Bryan Duarte told me it can get a bit distracting to talk to people while the assistant is babbling in your ear. Duarte, who has been blind since a motorcycle accident at the age of 18, told me he prefers Aleye to Meta AI's other accessibility features like Live AI. \"It will only tell me there's a person in front of me,\" he explains. \"It won't tell me if you're smiling. You have to prompt it every time, it won't just tell you stuff.\"Hapware has started taking pre-orders for the Aleye, which starts at $359 for the wristband or $637 for the wristband plus a year subscription to the app (a subscription is required and otherwise will cost $29 a month).

          "standfirst": "It's a new year, and a great time to fulfill your resolution to practice better cybersecurity. The early days of January are a great time to grab a last-minute subscription for yourself or a loved one. With access to a virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart online trackers. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $78.18 for a two-year subscription with four months free (78 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $100.58 for a two-year subscription with four months free (74 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan. NordVPN Plus — $105.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 84 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "How to use a VPN on iPhone",
          "standfirst": "Installing a virtual private network (VPN) on an iPhone or iPad is easy. The days are gone when Apple users had to be content with the leavings from the Windows ecosystem — in 2026, all the best VPN services have secure, user-friendly iOS apps on par with every other platform. If you've decided to add a VPN to your iPhone to stay anonymous online and change your virtual location, you've got plenty of great choices.Since you're here, chances are you're familiar with the benefits of using a VPN, including security on public Wi-Fi and the ability to explore streaming libraries in other countries. But you may still be daunted by the process of actually choosing, installing and configuring a VPN on your iPhone.In this article, I'll walk you through the steps, including how to configure a VPN manually without going through a service. Check out my how to use a VPN piece for more general information.How to choose an iPhone VPNOne of the trickiest parts of installing an iPhone VPN is picking the right service. That brings us to our first pro tip: Don’t just go to the App Store and search on “VPN.” That will simply front-load whichever vendor(s) are paying for top placement (note the little “Ad” icon) as well as a laundry list of free services that come with big caveats. There are dozens of mobile VPNs out there, and many of them don't put the user first (for example, I reported last year on popular VPNs that failed to disclose shared security flaws). Choosing hastily can leave you stuck with an iOS VPN that's either mediocre or actively harmful.Before downloading an iPhone VPN, do some research into the provider's background. A dependable VPN should have a well-written customer support page, a clear timeline of its history and a way to tell at a glance who actually owns and operates it. Check the reviews on the app store — it should have at least several hundred, almost all 4s and 5s.iPhone users have a particular advantage here: several VPNs let you download their iOS app and start using it without paying. You can use this free trial period to put the VPN through its paces. Start by testing its speed using Ookla speedtest or a similar app. You should also use an IP address checker to make sure it isn't leaking; to confirm this, just check your phone's IP address before and after connecting to the VPN and make sure it's different the second time.To keep things simple, my top recommendation for all platforms is Proton VPN. Out of all VPNs, it strikes the best balance of solid security, fast performance, useful features and a commitment to user privacy. Other iPhone VPNs I love include ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN.How to install a VPN on your iPhoneInstalling an iPhone VPN is like installing any other app. Just go to the App Store, find the VPN you've chosen and download it onto your phone. When it finishes downloading, open the app to grant permissions and finish setup. However, since there are a couple of potential sticking points, I'll run through the steps in more detail.Proton VPN on the iOS app store.Sam Chapman for EngadgetOpen the App Store.Tap the search bar and type in the name of your chosen VPN. Hit Search and look through the list of results. Be careful to pick the right one — there are some \"mockbuster\" VPNs that try to snare people looking for well-known names. As a rule, the one with the most reviews is the service worth using.On the page for the VPN app, tap Get. Enter your Apple ID and password to begin the installation.Once installation is complete, either tap Open in the App Store or find the new VPN icon on your home screen.Create a VPN account with a username and password. Most services let you do this within the app, but you may have to shift temporarily to a browser, so make sure you've got internet access.Choose a subscription. If there's a free trial, grab it and use it to test the VPN. If not, or if it's already expired, choose a plan that fits your budget and needs. Longer-term plans tend to save you money on average, but cost more at the start.On the VPN app, log in with your new credentials. You're now ready to get started.If you aren't interested in paying for software right now, you can still get an iOS VPN. Check out my list of the best free VPNs, which all have iPhone apps. We also constantly update a curated list of the best VPN deals for bargain hunters.How to configure and use a VPN on your iPhoneAn iOS VPN is generally usable with the default settings. Even so, it's a good idea to look through the options — you may not end up using all of them, but many of them are vital security checks or important quality-of-life boosters.Proton VPN's NetShield content blocker on iOS.Sam Chapman for EngadgetHere are some quick steps to make sure you're getting the best performance. These settings are in different places on each VPN, but most can be found by clicking a button with a gear icon, or any page labeled \"settings\" or \"preferences.\"Turn on the kill switch. This will protect you from broadcasting any data the VPN hasn't encrypted. In the event the VPN suddenly disconnects, the kill switch also cuts off your internet connection.Set the VPN to always reconnect automatically if it disconnects. The method for doing this varies between services, so check the VPN's help page. Some (like Proton VPN) have an always-on VPN setting in the app itself, while others (like ExpressVPN) handle it through iOS settings.Configure split tunneling. Not many iPhone VPNs have this option, but if yours does, you can use it to let certain apps or websites skip the VPN tunnel. Make sure to only bypass the VPN on sites and apps that share no sensitive information, or that refuse to work with a VPN active (some banks are like this).If your VPN has a feature for blocking ads and malware domains, I recommend using it — the worst it can do is not work.

Sometimes called Profiles, this relatively common feature lets you connect to the VPN and open a certain website with one tap.Decide when and how you want the VPN to send you notifications.Check available protocols. It's almost always best to let the VPN pick for you, but if you want to choose for yourself, IKEv2 is generally the fastest.Look over the server list to see what choices are available.When choosing a VPN server, think about what you need the VPN for. If you're just using it for privacy, pick the fastest server (or let the VPN app choose it for you). On the other hand, if you want to watch a movie or TV show that's only on streaming in another country, choose the fastest server in that country. If you're on a good VPN, it still shouldn't slow you down too much.If you have the address of a VPN server and the necessary credentials, iOS lets you set up your own VPN and connect directly. This is less convenient than using a provider app, since you need to know the details about every server you connect to, but it's nice if you're worried about trusting your privacy to a third party. It can also be convenient for quickly accessing a work or school VPN from your phone. Here's how to do it.Manually setting up a VPN connection on iOS.Sam Chapman for EngadgetOpen the Settings app. Scroll down and tap General.Scroll down again and tap VPN & Device Management.

Your ISP may sell this knowledge to marketers to target ads at you, or in worse cases, collaborate with governments willing to violate their citizens' rights to privacy.When you use a VPN, though, your real IP address is hidden behind that of the VPN server, so nothing you do on the internet connects back to you. That's why I always advise using a VPN on any device, including iPhones, that connects to the internet. It's even more important on the unprotected public networks you sometimes find in cafes and hotels. On the fun side, you can also use a VPN to change your virtual location to show you different content libraries on Netflix and other streaming platforms.One more thing: I often hear iPhone users ask whether they need a VPN, since iCloud Private Relay comes standard on iOS devices. Just to clear this up, iCloud Private Relay is not a VPN. As you can see from this support page, your ISP can still see your real IP address when it’s active.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Installing a virtual private network (VPN) on an iPhone or iPad is easy. The days are gone when Apple users had to be content with the leavings from the Windows ecosystem — in 2026, all the best VPN services have secure, user-friendly iOS apps on par with every other platform. If you've decided to add a VPN to your iPhone to stay anonymous online and change your virtual location, you've got plenty of great choices.Since you're here, chances are you're familiar with the benefits of using a VPN, including security on public Wi-Fi and the ability to explore streaming libraries in other countries. But you may still be daunted by the process of actually choosing, installing and configuring a VPN on your iPhone.In this article, I'll walk you through the steps, including how to configure a VPN manually without going through a service. Check out my how to use a VPN piece for more general information.How to choose an iPhone VPNOne of the trickiest parts of installing an iPhone VPN is picking the right service. That brings us to our first pro tip: Don’t just go to the App Store and search on “VPN.” That will simply front-load whichever vendor(s) are paying for top placement (note the little “Ad” icon) as well as a laundry list of free services that come with big caveats. There are dozens of mobile VPNs out there, and many of them don't put the user first (for example, I reported last year on popular VPNs that failed to disclose shared security flaws). Choosing hastily can leave you stuck with an iOS VPN that's either mediocre or actively harmful.Before downloading an iPhone VPN, do some research into the provider's background. A dependable VPN should have a well-written customer support page, a clear timeline of its history and a way to tell at a glance who actually owns and operates it. Check the reviews on the app store — it should have at least several hundred, almost all 4s and 5s.iPhone users have a particular advantage here: several VPNs let you download their iOS app and start using it without paying. You can use this free trial period to put the VPN through its paces. Start by testing its speed using Ookla speedtest or a similar app. You should also use an IP address checker to make sure it isn't leaking; to confirm this, just check your phone's IP address before and after connecting to the VPN and make sure it's different the second time.To keep things simple, my top recommendation for all platforms is Proton VPN. Out of all VPNs, it strikes the best balance of solid security, fast performance, useful features and a commitment to user privacy. Other iPhone VPNs I love include ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN.How to install a VPN on your iPhoneInstalling an iPhone VPN is like installing any other app. Just go to the App Store, find the VPN you've chosen and download it onto your phone. When it finishes downloading, open the app to grant permissions and finish setup. However, since there are a couple of potential sticking points, I'll run through the steps in more detail.Proton VPN on the iOS app store.Sam Chapman for EngadgetOpen the App Store.Tap the search bar and type in the name of your chosen VPN. Hit Search and look through the list of results. Be careful to pick the right one — there are some \"mockbuster\" VPNs that try to snare people looking for well-known names. As a rule, the one with the most reviews is the service worth using.On the page for the VPN app, tap Get. Enter your Apple ID and password to begin the installation.Once installation is complete, either tap Open in the App Store or find the new VPN icon on your home screen.Create a VPN account with a username and password. Most services let you do this within the app, but you may have to shift temporarily to a browser, so make sure you've got internet access.Choose a subscription. If there's a free trial, grab it and use it to test the VPN. If not, or if it's already expired, choose a plan that fits your budget and needs. Longer-term plans tend to save you money on average, but cost more at the start.On the VPN app, log in with your new credentials. You're now ready to get started.If you aren't interested in paying for software right now, you can still get an iOS VPN. Check out my list of the best free VPNs, which all have iPhone apps. We also constantly update a curated list of the best VPN deals for bargain hunters.How to configure and use a VPN on your iPhoneAn iOS VPN is generally usable with the default settings. Even so, it's a good idea to look through the options — you may not end up using all of them, but many of them are vital security checks or important quality-of-life boosters.Proton VPN's NetShield content blocker on iOS.Sam Chapman for EngadgetHere are some quick steps to make sure you're getting the best performance. These settings are in different places on each VPN, but most can be found by clicking a button with a gear icon, or any page labeled \"settings\" or \"preferences.\"Turn on the kill switch. This will protect you from broadcasting any data the VPN hasn't encrypted. In the event the VPN suddenly disconnects, the kill switch also cuts off your internet connection.Set the VPN to always reconnect automatically if it disconnects. The method for doing this varies between services, so check the VPN's help page. Some (like Proton VPN) have an always-on VPN setting in the app itself, while others (like ExpressVPN) handle it through iOS settings.Configure split tunneling. Not many iPhone VPNs have this option, but if yours does, you can use it to let certain apps or websites skip the VPN tunnel. Make sure to only bypass the VPN on sites and apps that share no sensitive information, or that refuse to work with a VPN active (some banks are like this).If your VPN has a feature for blocking ads and malware domains, I recommend using it — the worst it can do is not work. Some also include parental controls, in case you're setting up the VPN on your child's phone.Create shortcuts. Sometimes called Profiles, this relatively common feature lets you connect to the VPN and open a certain website with one tap.Decide when and how you want the VPN to send you notifications.Check available protocols. It's almost always best to let the VPN pick for you, but if you want to choose for yourself, IKEv2 is generally the fastest.Look over the server list to see what choices are available.When choosing a VPN server, think about what you need the VPN for.

          "standfirst": "Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia&#x27;s latest B200 graphics processors.The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year&#x27;s Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSlNousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release.\"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,\" wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability.How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicateWhat distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company&#x27;s Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.\"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,\" noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.\"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,\" Li wrote in the technical report.But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners.Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problemsNousCoder-14B&#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.The approach relies on what researchers call \"verifiable rewards\" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves \"dynamic sampling\" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.The researchers also adopted \"iterative context extension,\" first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters.The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progressBuried in Li&#x27;s technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses \"a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.\"In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.\"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,\" Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. \"This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.\"This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is \"increasingly finite,\" as Li put it.\"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,\" he concluded.The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. \"Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,\" he wrote.A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big TechNous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to open-source releases that compete with — and sometimes exceed — proprietary alternatives.The company raised $50 million in April 2025 in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its Psyche platform.Previous releases include Hermes 4, a family of models that we reported \"outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions,\" and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first \"toggle-on reasoning model\" — allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand.The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. \"Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,\" wrote one critic on X, referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance.Others raised technical questions. \"Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better,\" noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models. Another asked whether NousCoder-14B is \"agentic focused or just &#x27;one shot&#x27; coding\" — a distinction that matters for practical software development, where iterating on feedback typically produces better results than single attempts.What researchers say must happen next for AI coding tools to keep improvingThe release includes several directions for future work that hint at where AI coding research may be heading.Multi-turn reinforcement learning tops the list. Currently, the model receives only a final binary reward — pass or fail — after generating a solution. But competitive programming problems typically include public test cases that provide intermediate feedback: compilation errors, incorrect outputs, time limit violations. Training models to incorporate this feedback across multiple attempts could significantly improve performance.Controlling response length also remains a challenge. The researchers found that incorrect solutions tended to be longer than correct ones, and response lengths quickly saturated available context windows during training — a pattern that various algorithmic modifications failed to resolve.Perhaps most ambitiously, Li proposed \"problem generation and self-play\" — training models to both solve and create programming problems. This would address the data scarcity problem directly by enabling models to generate their own training curricula.\"Humans are great at generating interesting and useful problems for other competitive programmers, but it appears that there still exists a significant gap in LLM capabilities in creative problem generation,\" Li wrote.The model is available now on Hugging Face under an Apache 2.0 license. For researchers and developers who want to build on the work, Nous Research has published the complete Atropos training stack alongside it.What took Li two years of adolescent dedication to achieve—climbing from a 1600-level novice to a 2100-rated competitor on Codeforces—an AI replicated in 96 hours. He needed 1,000 problems. The model needed 24,000. But soon enough, these systems may learn to write their own problems, teach themselves, and leave human benchmarks behind entirely.The question is no longer whether machines can learn to code. It&#x27;s whether they&#x27;ll soon be better teachers than we ever were.",

Shine’s compact turbine isn’t going to power your house any time soon (though Rachel Carr, the company’s co-founder told me they have plans in that direction) but it can suck up the energy required to refill a smartphone in as little as 17 minutes. Of course, what it can generate depends on wind speed. That same charge could take as long as 11 hours if there’s only a slight breeze. That power curve, and its ability to operate at night, sets the turbine apart from solar panels.

Shine turbine 2.0 Shine The Shine 2.0 looks like a thin space football and has a screw-off cap that reveals a hollow compartment for the stand and tie downs.

This is the second version of the turbine and updates include a USB-C port instead of USB-A, as well as app connectivity. The company claims you can set the entire thing up in around two minutes.

However, their specs aren’t often tailored to the needs of gamers, so at CES 2026, ASUS and XREAL partnered to make a pair with two very important features you don’t normally get from rivals. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are based on the existing XREAL One Pro, so naturally they share a lot of the same components and specs including dual micro-OLED displays with a per-eye resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, three degrees of freedom (natively), 700-nit peak brightness, 57-degree FOV and built-in speakers tuned by Bose. However, the big difference on the R1s is that instead of maxing out with a 120Hz refresh rate, ASUS and XREAL’s collab goes all the way up to 240Hz. That’s a pretty nice bump, especially for people with older hardware or anyone who might not have access to a high refresh rate display or just doesn’t want to lower their standards while traveling. The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses deliver 1,920 x 1,080 resolution to each eye with a 240Hz refresh rate and 57-degree FOV. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe other big addition is the R1’s included ROG Control Dock, which from what I’ve seen is slightly better suited for home use. It’s designed to be a simple hub with two HDMI 2.0 jacks, one DisplayPort 1.4 connector and a couple of USB-C slots (one is for power), so you can quickly switch between multiple systems like your desktop and console with a single touch. That said, depending on the situation you might not even need the dock at all because the R1s can also be connected to compatible PCs or gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally X (see the synergy there?) directly via USB-C. When I got to try them out at CES, the R1s delivered a very easy to use and relatively streamlined kit. At 91 grams, they are barely heavier than the original XREAL One Pro (87g) so they don’t feel too weighty or cumbersome. I also really like the inclusion of electrochromic lenses, which allow you to change the tint of the glasses with the touch of a button. This lets you adjust how much or little light you want to come in through the front to best suit your environment. And thanks to support for three DOF, you have the ability to pin your virtual screen in one location or let it follow you around. Of course, ASUS and XREAL couldn't resist putting RGB lighting on the ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetNow it is important to remember that in order to get 240Hz on the smartglasses, you need hardware capable of pushing the kind of performance. So depending on the title, when the R1s are connected to something like a gaming handheld, you might not be able to get there. Luckily, I had the chance to use the specs when connected to a PC as well, which let me really appreciate the smoothness you get from faster refresh rates. General image quality was also quite good thanks to the glasses’ 1080p resolution, so I had no trouble reading text or discerning small UI elements. The ROG Control dock makes it easy to connect multiple devices to the ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses, but it may be a bit too bulky to pull out in tight situations like on a plane. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMy one small gripe is that I kind of wish its 57-degree FOV was a tiny bit bigger, but that’s more of a limitation of current optical technology as there aren't a ton of similarly sized specs that can go much higher (at least not yet). That said, even with its current FOV, you can still create up to a 171-inch virtual screen at four meters away, which is massively bigger than any portable screen you might entertain carrying around.Unfortunately, ASUS and XREAL haven’t announced official pricing or a release date for the R1s yet, but hopefully they won’t cost too much more than the XREAL One Pro, which are currently going for $649.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-and-xreal-teamed-up-at-ces-to-make-gaming-smartglasses-with-two-important-upgrades-190500897.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A startup called ReviMo has developed a robotic system that provides a way for people with limited mobility to lift and transfer themselves — like from a bed to a wheelchair, or to the toilet — without the assistance of a caregiver. ReviMo's Niko has two sets of arms: one that forms a \"scooping seat\" that slides underneath the person to lift them up, and the other encircling their torso and providing a backrest. It can be operated both by remote and using the controls on its dashboard. Niko in its current iteration can carry up to 250 pounds, but the team says it's working on a version that can support up to 400 pounds.In addition to aiding in transfers, Niko can lift the rider to a standing level and offers retractable handlebars for support. It also has the potential to be a big help to caregivers, who in many cases assist with multiple transfers every day. Even in a situation where a person isn't able to operate it by themselves, Niko facilitates a transfer that requires much less physical exertion than today's common methods, like sling-based mechanical lift systems. At CES, founder Aleksandr Malaschenko gave a demonstration of its lifting capabilities, using it to scoop him up from a chair and bring him out into the aisle. Niko is designed to work with most wheelchairs and be compact enough to navigate small bathrooms. It can position a person right above a toilet, and there are disposable seat covers. The goal is to help people with limited ability achieve more independence. It is the kind of device that, if it delivers on its promises, could be a game-changer for people with limited mobility and paralysis, and their loved ones. My dad was diagnosed with ALS when I was a kid, and I learned how to operate a Hoyer lift by the time I was in middle school. This strikes me as something we would have really appreciated having around. Malaschenko has said the inspiration for the robotic system came from being a caregiver for his grandfather following a stroke. Niko will cost about $15,000, though the team said it's working to get it covered by insurance. The company is also offering lower prices for customers who sign up for one of its premium waitlists, and there are options to rent it for those who would only need a lift and transfer system temporarily.

          "standfirst": "When LG announced that it would demo a laundry-folding, chore-doing robot at CES 2026, I was immediately intrigued. For years, I've wandered the Las Vegas Convention Center halls and wondered when someone might create a robot that can tackle the mundane but useful tasks I despise like folding laundry. With CLOiD (pronounced like \"Floyd\"), LG has proven that this is theoretically possible, but probably not likely to happen any time soon. I went to the company's CES booth to watch its demonstration of CLOiD's abilities, which also include serving food, fetching objects and fitness coaching. During a very carefully choreographed 15-minute presentation, I watched CLOiD grab a carton of milk out of the fridge, put a croissant in an oven, sort and fold some laundry and grab a set of keys off a couch and hand them to the human presenter.Throughout the demonstration, LG showed off how its own appliances can play along with the robot. When it rolled over to the fridge, the door automatically opened, as did the oven. When the LG-branded robot vacuum needed to move around a hamper, CLOiD helpfully cleared the path. But the robot also moved very slowly, which you can see in the highlight video below. The appliance maker is selling the setup as a part of its vision for a \"zero labor home\" where its appliances and, I guess, robotics technology can come together to take care of all your chores and household upkeep. Maybe I'm jaded from a decade of watching CES vaporware, but I left the slick demo thinking the concept is unlikely to amount to much anytime soon.On one hand, it is exciting to see robots competently performing tasks that would actually be useful to most people. But this technology is still far from accessible. Even LG isn't making any firm commitments about CLOiD's future as anything more than a CES demo. The company has instead said that CLOiD is a signal of its interest in creating \"home robots with practical functions\" and \"robotized appliances,\" like fridges with doors that can open automatically. That may be a more reasonable target for the company (and yet another way for LG to sell us more appliance upgrades). But it's still pretty far from anything approaching the fantasy of a \"zero labor home.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html?src=rss",
          "content": "When LG announced that it would demo a laundry-folding, chore-doing robot at CES 2026, I was immediately intrigued. For years, I've wandered the Las Vegas Convention Center halls and wondered when someone might create a robot that can tackle the mundane but useful tasks I despise like folding laundry. With CLOiD (pronounced like \"Floyd\"), LG has proven that this is theoretically possible, but probably not likely to happen any time soon. I went to the company's CES booth to watch its demonstration of CLOiD's abilities, which also include serving food, fetching objects and fitness coaching. During a very carefully choreographed 15-minute presentation, I watched CLOiD grab a carton of milk out of the fridge, put a croissant in an oven, sort and fold some laundry and grab a set of keys off a couch and hand them to the human presenter.Throughout the demonstration, LG showed off how its own appliances can play along with the robot. When it rolled over to the fridge, the door automatically opened, as did the oven. When the LG-branded robot vacuum needed to move around a hamper, CLOiD helpfully cleared the path. But the robot also moved very slowly, which you can see in the highlight video below. The appliance maker is selling the setup as a part of its vision for a \"zero labor home\" where its appliances and, I guess, robotics technology can come together to take care of all your chores and household upkeep. Maybe I'm jaded from a decade of watching CES vaporware, but I left the slick demo thinking the concept is unlikely to amount to much anytime soon.On one hand, it is exciting to see robots competently performing tasks that would actually be useful to most people. But this technology is still far from accessible. Even LG isn't making any firm commitments about CLOiD's future as anything more than a CES demo. The company has instead said that CLOiD is a signal of its interest in creating \"home robots with practical functions\" and \"robotized appliances,\" like fridges with doors that can open automatically. That may be a more reasonable target for the company (and yet another way for LG to sell us more appliance upgrades). But it's still pretty far from anything approaching the fantasy of a \"zero labor home.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming tech at the show too.You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week. We also have CES live updates, with all the latest news from the event.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and The Imperial March.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGLikewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES. The company is shining the spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person this week.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm are all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was laregly a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios. The company also revealed that a super computer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture NVIDIA unveiled in 2024 is in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel for a while, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it right the ship. These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. It’s more of a mid-range chip that isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the last generation.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for the specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint by bringing the ROG Zephyrus Duo to CES. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetMicro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August, — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that scene with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the Fire TV OS will deliver speed boosts of up to 20 to 30 percent. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates.Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first of those on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and give each a dedicated section of the display — that could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that set up. It's possible to control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES , though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for camping trips too, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the leadup to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one of those) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's only in prototype form for now and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It's said to have sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea) and bulkiness. However, after Sam opened it up, “my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate could come in very useful for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll get the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a physical keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150 mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then it's a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and it will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can seemingly identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s also a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there's going to be a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere are a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic (which costs $399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping in this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that draft an email when you say you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony and Honda to plan to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona.We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi (above) looks quite pretty and has a cup holder(!), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250 Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. And that’s not to mention emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. The company also unveiled a new Xbox controller with swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller and since I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. They can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio built in.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while thanks to its Sonos integration, and the Soundstage speaker is tempting too. The Soundstage will be available this summer for $350. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer hut no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model and the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victorla and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear earbuds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds, which have Dolby Atmos support. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the exterior of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now, but the audio quality is “excellent,” Billy wrote in his hands-on story.

          "content": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming tech at the show too.You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week. We also have CES live updates, with all the latest news from the event.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and The Imperial March.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGLikewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES. The company is shining the spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon, but we should get a closer look at the CLOiD in person this week.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm are all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was laregly a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios. The company also revealed that a super computer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture NVIDIA unveiled in 2024 is in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel for a while, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it right the ship. These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. It’s more of a mid-range chip that isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the last generation.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for the specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint by bringing the ROG Zephyrus Duo to CES. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetMicro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August, — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that scene with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the Fire TV OS will deliver speed boosts of up to 20 to 30 percent. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates.Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first of those on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and give each a dedicated section of the display — that could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that set up. It's possible to control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES , though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for camping trips too, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the leadup to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one of those) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. First Look has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's only in prototype form for now and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It's said to have sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea) and bulkiness. However, after Sam opened it up, “my concerns were quickly pushed aside because suddenly you’re greeted with 10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate could come in very useful for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll get the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a physical keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150 mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then it's a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and it will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can seemingly identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s also a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there's going to be a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere are a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic (which costs $399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping in this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that draft an email when you say you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony and Honda to plan to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona.We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi (above) looks quite pretty and has a cup holder(!), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250 Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. And that’s not to mention emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. The company also unveiled a new Xbox controller with swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller and since I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. They can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio built in.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while thanks to its Sonos integration, and the Soundstage speaker is tempting too. The Soundstage will be available this summer for $350. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer hut no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model and the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victorla and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear earbuds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds, which have Dolby Atmos support. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the exterior of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now, but the audio quality is “excellent,” Billy wrote in his hands-on story.

          "standfirst": "I’m no psychologist, but I get a sense Segway turned up to CES 2026 with something to prove after last year. Certainly, it’s gone out of its way to prove its micromobility bona fides with the press, who perhaps were a bit too sniffy that scooter people were launching an e-bike. This year, Segway’s not just launching two more mainstream e-bikes, but an electric dirt bike, all of which are crammed with the sort of tech that might just make everyone halt their sniffiness.First up, there’s the Myon, a chunky step-through with a decent-sized pannier rack for folks who want to go far and carry a bit of luggage as they go. That’s hardly an eye-catching proposition given so many e-bikes fit within the same template, but Segway is hoping its tech will make a difference here. Myon is equipped with electronic gear shifting (tied to a Shimano CUES chain drivetrain), electronic motor optimization and the company’s proprietary Intelligent Ride System. The latter, along with Segway(TM) TurboTuned(TM) will automatically optimize motor and battery performance while under way. The company adds that the bike’s built-in gyros, cadence and torque sensors will meter out performance according to road conditions. So if you’re going up hill, the power will gently increase before you have to think about it. Additionally, if you stop at the lights, the system won’t just turn on the power to whatever you’ve set it at as soon as it senses the tiniest ounce of pressure on the pedal, removing the jerky start action you see in other bikes.Segway’s broader pitch is that its bikes will also feature a whole host of smart features, including integration with Apple’s Find My network, GPS tracking, remote locking, integration with your health and fitness app of choice, and smartphone pairing. MuxiSegwayMuxi (pronounced moo-shee) is a more interesting piece of hardware, since it’s been built like a longtail cargo bike, but with the long tail chopped off. Even so, the focus is on cargo, with the bike getting an optional passenger seat with foot pegs, and an optional middle basket. Plus, the bike comes with a beverage cup holder (although given it has a direct drive motor, I’m not sure I’d want to cruise around at low speed while trying to sip my morning latte). To ensure you don’t struggle with your load, the bike comes with Hill Start Assist, Hill Descent Control, regenerative braking and traction control. Plus the aforementioned suite of added value features, like Find My integration, remote locking, GPS and the app integrations. Rounding out the announcements is the Xaber (say-br) 300, an electric dirt bike geared toward off-roading. It has three power modes, letting you learn on the equivalent of a 150cc engine, then dialing that up to 200cc, before topping out at 300cc. If you still want a greater sense of control, you can activate an electronic clutch, and if you want to cede more of it to the bike, you can set the maximum wheelie angle. If you want to enjoy all of that dirt bikin’ action, it’ll set you back $5,300 when it arrives.As for Myon, it’s available to buy today from Segway’s official site and via its dealer network, priced at $2,000. Muxi will be available through those same channels in March, setting you back $1,700.

Other than a knee injury more than a decade ago, my ability to walk long distances has largely been limited only by my own choices. That's not the case for everyone, though. And robotics company Dephy has created a pair of robotic sneakers, called the Sidekick, that are meant to help people who want to walk more than their bodies might otherwise be capable of.The system consists of two parts: an ankle-worn exoskeleton and a special pair of sneakers that attach to it. The exoskeleton hooks onto the back of the shoe and is secured with a strap around your calf. The battery powered device is equipped with sensors that can detect and adapt to the wearer's gait in order to deliver an extra \"boost\" with each step. The whole setup is pricey, at $4,500, but Dephy is betting that people who have \"personal range anxiety\" might be willing to pay for the extra confidence the Sidekick can provide. \"This is a device that's kind of like [having] an extra calf muscle,\" Dephy CEO Luke Mooney told me. The Sidekick.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI was able to take the Sidekick for a spin around the CES showfloor and it was a truly surprising sensation. The best way I can describe walking with the Sidekick powered on is that with every step forward there's a noticeable upward push from under your heel. It wasn't enough to throw me off balance, but it did feel a bit strange.The Sidekick has adjustable power levels based on how much help you might need. At the highest level, it definitely felt unnecessarily pushy. The lower levels were still noticeable but felt less disruptive. I just felt… bouncy. Later, when Mooney turned off the power entirely, I noticed that my feet felt weirdly heavy in a way they hadn't just a few minutes before. Mooney was quick to tell me that I'm not Dephy's target demographic. \"A lot of times people who are fit, or like athletes, actually struggle to adopt to the technology because their body's so in tune with how they move,\" he said. \"Whereas folks who are not as physically active and fit, their body's ready to accept help.\"The company's technology will be used in products more focused on athletic performance, however. Dephy has partnered with Nike on its upcoming robotic sneaker currently known as Project Amplify. Mooney declined to share details on the collaboration, but the shoemaker has claimed that some early testers have been able to improve their mile times by two minutes. I tried the Sidekick early in the day. Several hours later, though, when I was walking between the Las Vegas Conventions Center halls for the third or fourth time, I started thinking about those robotic sneakers again. I was getting close to 10,000 steps and hadn't sat down for hours. My feet were sore. I remembered that strange, bouncy boost and thought it sounded kind of nice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/these-robotic-sneakers-gave-me-a-surprising-boost-at-ces-174500005.html?src=rss",

The company’s new initiative, Smart Play, encompasses the Smart Brick as well as Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags. It’s remains to be seen how diehard Lego fans will take to this new system, but it’s fair to say this is the biggest move Lego has ever made to infuse its products with connected technology. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside of it that Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It runs something called the Play Engine that can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields. Thanks to this and some integrated copper coils, the Smart Brick can sense distance, direction and orientation of other Smart Bricks near it when you’re building. The brick also has a tiny built-in speaker, an accelerometer and an LED array. Lego says the speaker can produce audio that is “tied to live play actions” rather than just playing pre-recorded clips. The Smart Tag and Smart Minifigures are a lot simpler. The Tag is a 2 x 2 studless tile with a digital ID embedded in it that the Smart Brick can read via “near-field magnetic communication.” This obviously sounds a lot like NFC, but we can’t be sure that these new Lego pieces will be able to communicate with any other NFC devices. Similarly, the Smart Minifigure also has a digital ID readable by NFC. The purpose of the Smart Tag as well as the similar tech in a Smart Minifigure is to let the Smart Brick know what kind of context it is being used in. As Lego puts it, “The role of the Smart Tag is to tell the Smart Brick how it should play back with you.” The Tag tells the Brick what kind of object, animal, vehicle and so forth it should become. A Smart Tag in a Lego Star Wars X-Wing set, for example, will contain the unique ID and instructions for how the Smart Brick should behave. If this isn’t enough, Lego has also built a local wireless layer that connects this all together called BrickNet. It’s based on Bluetooth and uses Lego’s proprietary “Neighbor Position Measurement\" system, which is what lets the Smart Bricks know how close they are to each other and how they’re oriented. Lego says that this lets the bricks “talk” to each other directly without the need for apps, internet connections or external controls. It sounds like the idea is all three of these new Smart pieces can communicate and interact without any need for setup, which should make it refreshingly like a traditional Lego set. That said, these bricks naturally will need some power. Lego says that their batteries should still perform even after “years” of inactivity, and the coils and power system is designed so that multiple bricks can be charged wirelessly on a shared charging pad. Lego Star Wars set with Smart Bricks Lego Speaking of sets, Lego is unsurprisingly launching the Smart Play system with its biggest licensed partner: Star Wars. There will be three “all-in-one” Star Wars sets available, all of which are on the smaller side and definitely geared towards kids, rather than the 1,000 piece and up sets that the company has released to get adults (like me) interested. The prices are inflated compared to non-smart sets, but not outrageously so. Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter is a 473-piece set with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, priced at $70. Luke’s Red Five X-Wing is a 584-piece set with two Smart Minifigures, one Smart Brick and five Smart Tags, priced at $100. The Throne Room Duel & A-wing is a 962-piece set with three Smart Minifigures, two Smart Bricks and five Smart Tags, priced at a slightly shocking $160. It’s an entirely new direction for Lego, and you won’t have to wait long to check it out. The company is putting those three sets up for pre-order on January 9, and they’ll launch on March 1. There’s obviously a lot of technology here that’s entirely new to Lego, and as such it’s hard to imagine just how this will all look when it comes together — but we’re hoping that Lego will have some sets on hand here at CES so we can get a closer look at how the Smart Play system works. In the meantime, you can find a few videos on how Smart Play works here.

          "standfirst": "It's been six years since Sony first rolled out its prototype car at CES 2020. It was called the Vision-S back then, and I remember everyone endlessly debating just how serious the consumer electronics powerhouse was about making a car. Over the subsequent half-decade, Sony has proven it is not only serious, but absolutely hell-bent on making this thing a reality.At CES 2026, we're still somehow about 12 months away from that car hitting the roads. Now called the Afeela 1, instead of being built by Sony proper it will come from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility. It will start at $89,900, offer around 300 miles of range, and wear an exterior design so sedate that even the 31.5-inch-wide \"Media Bar\" micro-LED integrated into the nose barely makes an impact.With the Afeela up on stage again this year, what's new in 2026? I'm fresh from getting a closer look at the sedan here in Las Vegas and, sadly, there's little more to see than what so underwhelmed me last year. From the outside, 2026's Afeela looks nigh identical to 2025's, save for one change: I'm happy to report that the unfortunate seam running down the middle of last year's nose-mounted Media Bar has been fixed. It now appears to be a single, contiguous panel.On the inside, the interior seems to have a higher degree of fit and finish than last year's. To get in, you either push on a little button hidden in the trim or pull out the smartphone app and request that the door open automatically. There are no door latches as such, something that might raise a few eyebrows given Tesla's current door handle woes. (I was told there are physical door releases hidden below the car on the outside, and low in the door card on the inside.)Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026Tim Stevens for EngadgetThe door closes automatically once you're inside, instantly hushing the manic drone of the crowd on the always-packed CES floor. This creates a great soundscape for the whopping 28 speakers Sony is deploying here. The car's interior shape was actually designed to optimize the placement of those speakers, and the few moments of music I heard were impressive.There's Dolby Atmos support, so you can take full advantage of the spatial audio features in the cockpit. You can even toggle the sound on or off for individual seats, perhaps helping a little one stay asleep in the back seat — or simply sparing your kids from the depths of your guilty pleasure playlist.The most noticeable feature inside the car, though, is the sweeping display that runs across the dashboard. There's a 12.3-inch LCD gauge cluster on the left conjoined with a 28.5-inch display that goes all the way to the right. Sony's infotainment software effectively splits that rightmost panel in two, enabling you or the passenger to drag apps left or right as needed.Media or other distracting apps running on the passenger's side of the display will trigger an integrated privacy shield, blacking it out ensuring minimal distraction for the driver. But Sony is still pushing the envelope a bit here in a few other areas. You can dial into Zoom meetings from the driver's seat, for example, and while the Afeela 1 won't be the first car to do this (Mercedes-Benz included the service in the car in its 2024 E-Class), Sony will actually let the driver participate in the video while driving. This seems a little unnecessary to me.Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026Tim Stevens for EngadgetZoom uses the ceiling-mounted camera, one of 40 sensors in and around the Afeela 1. That includes the pods for a LiDAR sensor and more cameras protruding rather conspicuously from the roof. These sensors will provide Level 2+ driver assistance at launch. Over time, Sony promises to upgrade the car to Level 4, meaning that you, the driver, could theoretically take a nap behind the wheel. The car certainly looks to have enough sensors and processing power to make that work, but as we saw with Tesla's Full Self Driving, these sorts of automotive upgrades have a tendency to take longer than anticipated.Some of that digital processing power comes courtesy of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis, which also powers the infotainment experience. The software that runs the dashboard and rear seat experience looked far more comprehensive than before. That includes a functional AI voice assistant providing advanced routing guidance, like telling you which of the dozen taquerias on your route has the best guac.Personalization is a big part of the sales pitch here, with downloadable packages changing everything from the car's ambient lights to the gauge cluster, engine sound, and even whatever's displayed on the nose-mounted display.The idea here is to give you an emotional connection with the car -- despite its decidedly emotionless exterior design.Sony Honda Mobility at CES 2026Tim Stevens for Engadget\"Our brand, Afeela, is built on a vision to redefine the relationship between people and mobility,\" Izumi Kawanishi, Sony Honda Mobility's president and COO, said. \"Being in a car will no longer be about driving. It will be about making the most of your time and space while you move.\"I got to sample a number of these customizations at the show, including a particularly cool one that replicated the dashboard of Honda's first-ever Grand Prix-winning machine, 1965's RA272. The Afeela even picked up the raspy sound of its 1.5-liter V12.The pre-production car on the Afeela stage had about a dozen such experiences installed, but the plan is for many, many more. Sony Honda Mobility will launch what it's calling the Afeela Co-Creation Program, a set of software developer tools and interfaces enabling third-party developers to not only create their own customizations, but to sell them.Yes, alternate revenue streams are a big part of the equation here, including premium audio and video purchases, but Sony seemingly isn't factoring that in to help make the Afeela 1 more affordable. Again, you're looking at $89,900 to start, a price that hasn't changed from last year.In fact, the biggest change to the Afeela 1 since CES 2025's showing is a delay. The sedan now isn't hitting the road until the very end of 2026, with first, limited deliveries happening in California. Arizona is next in 2027, but it could be years more before it's available anywhere else in the world.Don't call it vaporware, though, because it is coming. Trial production work is already happening at Honda's plant in Ohio.

          "title": "The biggest TV announcements at CES 2026",
          "standfirst": "CES is once again where TV manufacturers lay out their plans for the year ahead, and CES 2026 is shaping up to be a showcase of both familiar rivalries and genuinely new display tech. While OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups, Micro RGB has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the market. Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues. Samsung Micro RGB TVs Samsung's flagship Micro RGB TV Engadget Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs. The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping 130-inch Micro RGB concept, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at Samsung’s First Look event. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in. Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward. Samsung OLED TVs Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs. The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups. Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences. LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV LG's 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV Devindra Hardawar for Engadget LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away. Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown. LG Micro RGB evo TVs LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its Micro RGB evo lineup, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization. LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management. This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles. LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H) OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume. These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year. TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV TCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness. The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company. The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates. With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-190929976.html?src=rss",
          "content": "CES is once again where TV manufacturers lay out their plans for the year ahead, and CES 2026 is shaping up to be a showcase of both familiar rivalries and genuinely new display tech. While OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups, Micro RGB has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the market. Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues. Samsung Micro RGB TVs Samsung's flagship Micro RGB TV Engadget Samsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs. The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping 130-inch Micro RGB concept, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at Samsung’s First Look event. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in. Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward. Samsung OLED TVs Samsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs. The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups. Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences. LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV LG's 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TV Devindra Hardawar for Engadget LG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away. Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown. LG Micro RGB evo TVs LG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its Micro RGB evo lineup, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.

          "standfirst": "Vision tests are an important part of life, but they aren’t always the most convenient things to work into your schedule. It’s an issue Eyebot thinks it has solved with its kiosk, which shrinks the time taken from 20 minutes to closer to three minutes. Plus, you don’t need to book an appointment where an optician will lean too close in to your face while trial and error-ing corrective lenses. As mundane as a subject as a visit to the eye doctor is, this device could have some fairly massive ramifications. And, having tested it, I can certainly see the benefits.Eyebot CEO Matthias Hofmann said that, despite the popularity of online glasses retailers like Warby Parker, 85 percent of Americans prefer to buy glasses in person. But accessibility is a big issue, especially in areas where there aren’t enough eye doctors to efficiently process tests. Hofmann added that this issue is far worse in rural areas, where people may need to drive for an hour or more to see an eye doctor, and then wait two weeks for their prescription to be filed. It’s these two maladies that Eyebot’s kiosk is meant to address, allowing people to walk up and complete their vision test whenever they want.The test itself is very simple, you just walk up to the kiosk and let the big touchscreen walk you through the steps. You’ll answer some basic screening questions — this test is suitable for those aged 18 to 64 — and then complete a fairly perfunctory letter test. Once that’s done, you’ll be asked to stare at a picture of a hot air balloon (but not the picture you’re thinking of). Once that’s done, you just need to share your email address and then wait for your prescription to be filed.But you don’t need to worry that your eye health is being left to some algorithm making its best guess. Eyebot explained that each of its prescriptions are sent to an eye doctor working remotely who can look at the data the kiosk has generated, signing off on the prescription. Thankfully, I was able to compare this prescription with my last eye test (conducted by a professional) from the previous year, and found that Eyebot’s results matched it perfectly. It is worth noting, however, that Eyebot can’t run any medical tests; like the little puff of air blown onto your eyes to measure the pressure your eyes can withstand, which shows your risk of glaucoma. Consequently, while you can get your prescription with this process, you’ll still be advised to take regular visits to see a clinician. Eyebot is presently operating in limited numbers in some Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in Pennsylvania, with plans to roll this out across the US in the near future. For the former, you’ll need to pay, while the latter comes as a benefit of your membership. Hofmann said that he envisages a future where there are Eyebot kiosks in shopping malls or at brick and mortar stores for online glasses retailers to grease the wheels of getting that fancy new pair of specs.

          "standfirst": "CES 2026 isn't the first year we've seen a wave of interesting robots or even useful robots crop up in Las Vegas. But it's the first year I can remember when there have been so many humanoid and humanoid-like robots performing actually useful tasks. Of those, Switchbot's Onero H1 has been one of the most intriguing robot helpers I've seen on the show floor, especially because the company says that it will actually go on sale later this year (though it won't come cheap). Up to now, Chinese company Switchbot has been known for its robot vacuums and smart home devices. Much of that expertise is evident in Onero. The unexpectedly cute robot has a wheeled base that looks similar to the company's robot vacuums, but is also equipped with a set of articulated arms that can help it perform common household tasks. I was able to see some of its abilities at Switchbot's CES booth, where Onero dutifully picked up individual articles of clothing from a couch, rolled over to a washing machine, opened the door, placed the items inside and closed the door. The robot moved a bit slowly; it took nearly two minutes for it to grab one piece of clothing and deposit it inside the appliance which was only a few feet away. I'm not sure if its slowness was a quirk of the poor CES Wi-Fi, a demo designed to maximize conference-goers attention or a genuine limitation of the robot. But I'm not sure it matters all that much. The whole appeal of a chore robot is that it can take care of things when you're not around; if you come home to a load of laundry that's done, it's not that concerning if the robot took longer to complete the task than you would have. The laundry is done and you don't have to do it. That's the dream. Under the hood, Onero is powered by RealSense cameras and other sensors that help it learn its surroundings, as well as on-device AI models.The demo of course only offered a very limited glimpse of Onero's potential capabilities. In a promotional video shared by Switchbot, the company suggests the robot can so much, much more: serve food and drinks, put dishes away, wash windows, fold clothes and complete a bunch of other — frankly, impressive — tasks. The Onero in the video also has an articulated hand with five fingers that gives it more dexterity than the claw-hand one I saw at CES. A Switchbot rep told me, though, that it plans to offer both versions when it does go on sale. Which brings me to the most exciting part about watching Onero: the company is actually planning on selling it this year. A Switchbot rep confirmed to me it will be available to buy sometime in 2026, though it will likely be closer to the end of the year. The company hasn't settled on a final price, but I was told it will be \"less than $10,000.\" While we don't know how much less, it's safe to say Onero won't come cheap. It also seems fair to say that this will be a very niche device compared to many of Switchbot's other products. But, if it can competently handle everything the company claims it can, then there's probably a lot of people and businesses that would be willing to pay.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/switchbot-came-to-ces-with-a-laundry-robot-you-might-actually-be-able-to-buy-153000025.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Lego Smart Play hands-on: Using Smart Brick technology to get kids to play together",
          "standfirst": "Lego’s Smart Play system announced at CES 2026 earlier this week is a new embrace of digital technology that we haven’t seen from the company before. While the demo Lego gave at its press conference on Monday was a good start to showing what Smart Bricks are capable of, it really isn’t a substitute for seeing it in person. I was able to get an extended demo that answered many of my questions about how the system will work once Lego fans of all ages get their hands on the first Smart Play sets.As I detailed yesterday, the Smart Play system contains three elements. The Smart Brick is packed with technology like proximity sensors, an accelerometer, color sensors and a speaker, all powered by a tiny chip. It’s crucial to know that each Smart Brick is identical at this point; to really bring a set to life, you need to combine it with Smart Tags or Smart Minifigures. Both the Tags and Minifigures contain specific instructions that help the Brick understand the context that it is placed in.The demo started out simply, with three small Lego builds: a car, a helicopter and a duck. Each of those builds had a unique Smart Tag that the Smart Brick uses to understand how it should respond to real-world stimulus. The car started making the sound of a revving engine, and when playing with it to drive it faster and more aggressively, the engine made more noise. Tilting the car would cause it to make some screeching sounds as if it was taking corners hard, and flipping it over would make the sound of a car wreck. The Smart Brick can similarly sense what specific Smart Minifigures is near it and respond accordingly. Since the first three Smart Play sets are all based on Star Wars, it’s a little easier to explain how they interact with the Smart Brick. Take the Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set — it includes Smart Minifigs for Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine, and there are also Smart Tags that correspond to various actions the characters can take. If you place a Smart Brick behind Palpatine’s throne, the classic “Imperial March” theme will ring out and Palpatine himself will chatter a bit. The Minifigures don’t actually say real words, but they can still embody their characters well enough. Vader, for example, offers his classic breathing sound and exclaim if he’s defeated in a light saber duel.Lego Smart Play Star Wars setsNathan Ingraham for EngadgetThat duel is a clever part of this set. There are moveable mounts you can place Luke and Vader on, along with a Smart Brick. To complete the battle scene, a Smart Tag tells the brick to take on the characteristics necessary for a light saber battle. As such, when you place the Minifigures in the mount, you’ll hear the classic sound of a light saber humming to life. And if you move the characters around and crash them together, you’ll hear the sounds of battle. Finally, knocking a Minifigure off its spot will tell the brick associated with that character to make their trademark sound of defeat — in Vader’s case, that’s the iconic “noooooooo.” The other two new Smart Play sets are Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter and Luke’s Red Five X-Wing — an ideal pair for some space-based dogfighting. The X-Wing shows off how good the Smart Brick is at handling multiple inputs. Adding it to the X-Wing will make sounds of the ship humming to life, thanks to the X-Wing-specific Smart Tile. Sit Luke in the cockpit and you’ll hear the Jedi theme music play, and seating R2-D2 in the back will make the Droid chatter at you in its familiar tones. The Smart Tile is how the Smart Brick identifies this set as an X-Wing figher.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPitting the two ships against each other shows off more of the Smart Brick’s capabilities. Grabbing the ships and whooshing them through the air will make the Smart Brick play sounds that aren’t just generic engine noises — you can definitely hear the difference between the X-Wing and the TIE fighter. Each ship also has lasers you can activate, and if two kids are in the same room flying ships around and firing off lasers, you’ll hear the ships taking “damage” as well. Firing enough shots while aiming at another ship will eventually cause it to play some exploding sounds to indicate that it has gone up in flames — the Minifigures associated with the ship will also make sounds of dismay, as well. At first glance, the sets themselves don’t feel wildly different than other smaller-scale Star Wars sets, but the people from the Lego Group giving the demo pointed out a few notable characteristics. The TIE fighter and X-Wing are both specifically designed to withstand more abuse from active play scenarios than the average Lego set, and they’re also specifically designed to fit will in a kid’s hand so they can run around and propel them through the air. The Throne Room set, meanwhile, has a detachable area where Luke and Vader can battle — you can remove and re-attach it to the throne area easily enough, but it’s good to separate it out for more aggressive light saber battles.Lego Smart Play Star Wars setsNathan Ingraham for EngadgetAll told, I’m quite excited to see where Lego goes with its Smart Play system from here. Starting out with some simpler sets from a massive franchise like Star Wars is a logical way to introduce the system. There are obvious play scenarios that make perfect sense as a way to show off the Smart Brick. But I’m looking forward to a time when Lego starts selling tiles and Minifigures that can expand the capabilities of existing sets, whether they’re licensed or not. And the idea of smushing together Star Wars with some of the many other properties that Lego has access to (Jurassic World? DC or Marvel? Despicable Me or Bluey?) feels like just the kind of chaotic fun kids will love having.That’s perhaps the most important point about Smart Play. While Lego has made major overtures for capturing the hearts and wallets of adult Lego fans, Smart Play is very clearly aimed at kids right now. There are no screens, apps or setup needed for Smart Play — it seems exceedingly easy to just pick up and start playing. Furthermore, Lego is using this technology to make Lego sets more interactive, something the company hopes will encourage more social play amongst kids. That’s a solid use of the technology packed into a Smart Brick if you ask me.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html?src=rss",

The Smart Brick can similarly sense what specific Smart Minifigures is near it and respond accordingly. Since the first three Smart Play sets are all based on Star Wars, it’s a little easier to explain how they interact with the Smart Brick. Take the Throne Room Duel & A-Wing set — it includes Smart Minifigs for Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine, and there are also Smart Tags that correspond to various actions the characters can take. If you place a Smart Brick behind Palpatine’s throne, the classic “Imperial March” theme will ring out and Palpatine himself will chatter a bit. The Minifigures don’t actually say real words, but they can still embody their characters well enough. Vader, for example, offers his classic breathing sound and exclaim if he’s defeated in a light saber duel.Lego Smart Play Star Wars setsNathan Ingraham for EngadgetThat duel is a clever part of this set. There are moveable mounts you can place Luke and Vader on, along with a Smart Brick. To complete the battle scene, a Smart Tag tells the brick to take on the characteristics necessary for a light saber battle. As such, when you place the Minifigures in the mount, you’ll hear the classic sound of a light saber humming to life. And if you move the characters around and crash them together, you’ll hear the sounds of battle. Finally, knocking a Minifigure off its spot will tell the brick associated with that character to make their trademark sound of defeat — in Vader’s case, that’s the iconic “noooooooo.” The other two new Smart Play sets are Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter and Luke’s Red Five X-Wing — an ideal pair for some space-based dogfighting. The X-Wing shows off how good the Smart Brick is at handling multiple inputs. Adding it to the X-Wing will make sounds of the ship humming to life, thanks to the X-Wing-specific Smart Tile. Sit Luke in the cockpit and you’ll hear the Jedi theme music play, and seating R2-D2 in the back will make the Droid chatter at you in its familiar tones. The Smart Tile is how the Smart Brick identifies this set as an X-Wing figher.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPitting the two ships against each other shows off more of the Smart Brick’s capabilities. Grabbing the ships and whooshing them through the air will make the Smart Brick play sounds that aren’t just generic engine noises — you can definitely hear the difference between the X-Wing and the TIE fighter. Each ship also has lasers you can activate, and if two kids are in the same room flying ships around and firing off lasers, you’ll hear the ships taking “damage” as well. Firing enough shots while aiming at another ship will eventually cause it to play some exploding sounds to indicate that it has gone up in flames — the Minifigures associated with the ship will also make sounds of dismay, as well. At first glance, the sets themselves don’t feel wildly different than other smaller-scale Star Wars sets, but the people from the Lego Group giving the demo pointed out a few notable characteristics. The TIE fighter and X-Wing are both specifically designed to withstand more abuse from active play scenarios than the average Lego set, and they’re also specifically designed to fit will in a kid’s hand so they can run around and propel them through the air. The Throne Room set, meanwhile, has a detachable area where Luke and Vader can battle — you can remove and re-attach it to the throne area easily enough, but it’s good to separate it out for more aggressive light saber battles.Lego Smart Play Star Wars setsNathan Ingraham for EngadgetAll told, I’m quite excited to see where Lego goes with its Smart Play system from here. Starting out with some simpler sets from a massive franchise like Star Wars is a logical way to introduce the system. There are obvious play scenarios that make perfect sense as a way to show off the Smart Brick. But I’m looking forward to a time when Lego starts selling tiles and Minifigures that can expand the capabilities of existing sets, whether they’re licensed or not. And the idea of smushing together Star Wars with some of the many other properties that Lego has access to (Jurassic World? DC or Marvel? Despicable Me or Bluey?) feels like just the kind of chaotic fun kids will love having.That’s perhaps the most important point about Smart Play. While Lego has made major overtures for capturing the hearts and wallets of adult Lego fans, Smart Play is very clearly aimed at kids right now. There are no screens, apps or setup needed for Smart Play — it seems exceedingly easy to just pick up and start playing. Furthermore, Lego is using this technology to make Lego sets more interactive, something the company hopes will encourage more social play amongst kids. That’s a solid use of the technology packed into a Smart Brick if you ask me.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES remains a key stage for laptop makers to lay out their plans for the year ahead. At CES 2026, that meant new flagship productivity machines, reconsidered gaming notebooks and solid incremental updates across several major lineups. While we’re still seeing embargoes lift and hands-on time on the show floor, the announcements below reflect the most significant laptops we’ve seen so far. Plus, the list will grow as more companies reveal details throughout January 6 and beyond.Lenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovo Legion Pro RollableEngadgetLenovo came prepared for CES 2026 with a ton of laptops — concepts, fully-formed designs and everything in betwee. The most striking concept was the Legion Pro Rollable, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.Lenovo also showed the XD Rollable concept, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view.Samsung Galaxy Book6 seriesNew Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.Samsung announced the Galaxy Book6 family at CES 2026, introducing three new laptops built around Intel’s Panther Lake chips: the Galaxy Book6, Book6 Pro and Book6 Ultra. The focus this year is on slimmer designs, improved thermals and longer battery life, with Samsung claiming up to 30 hours of video playback on the Book6 Ultra and Pro.The 16-inch Galaxy Book6 Ultra sits at the top of the lineup, with configurations offering up to Intel Core Ultra X9 processors, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, including RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 options. Samsung says the Ultra delivers up to 1.6x better CPU performance and 1.7x improved graphics compared with the previous Galaxy Book generation, helped by a wider vapor chamber and a new dual-path fan system for GPU cooling.Both the Book6 Ultra and Book6 Pro feature upgraded 2,880 x 1,800 AMOLED 2X displays with touch support, adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and peak brightness of up to 1,000 nits. The laptops are thinner than their predecessors, with the Ultra measuring 15.4mm thick and the Pro coming in at 11.9mm — and Samsung has added haptic trackpads across the series for the first time. Pricing and release dates have not yet been announced.ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoOn top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.ASUS brought its dual-screen design into the gaming space at CES 2026 with the ROG Zephyrus Duo, a laptop that pairs two full-size 16-inch displays with high-end gaming hardware. Unlike productivity-focused dual-screen systems, the Zephyrus Duo is positioned as a hybrid machine designed to handle gaming, content creation and multitasking in a single portable setup.Both 16-inch Nebula OLED panels support HDR with up to 1,100 nits of peak brightness, NVIDIA G-SYNC, stylus input and high color accuracy. Performance comes from Intel’s latest Core Ultra processors paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5090. While the system’s 135W power budget means it won’t match the raw performance of some single-screen gaming laptops, ASUS is clearly prioritizing versatility over maximum output.The Zephyrus Duo includes a detachable wireless keyboard, a built-in kickstand and multiple usage modes, including stacked dual-screen layouts and drawing configurations. Despite weighing a whopping 6.28 pounds, ASUS has kept the chassis relatively slim at 0.77 inches and equipped it with a six-speaker system, vapor chamber cooling and a broad selection of ports including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1 and a full-size SD card slot. Pricing and availability have not yet been announced.MSI Stealth 16 AI+MSI's most powerful gaming laptop.MSIMSI updated its Stealth lineup at CES 2026 with the Stealth 16 AI+, a gaming laptop designed to balance performance and portability. The system measures just 16.6mm thick, weighs under two kilograms and is equipped with NVIDIA RTX 50-series graphics alongside Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors.Despite its slim profile, the Stealth 16 AI+ includes dual memory slots and dual SSD bays, giving it more upgrade flexibility than many thin gaming laptops. MSI is positioning it as a versatile machine for users who want gaming performance without the bulk typically associated with high-end hardware.MSI Crosshair 16 Max HXThe Crosshair 16 Max HX represents MSI’s more traditional gaming approach, pairing Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series GPUs. It sits below the company’s flagship Raider models but still targets players who want strong performance in a relatively streamlined chassis.Buyers can opt for an optional QHD+ OLED display with a 165Hz refresh rate, adding sharper visuals and smoother motion for gaming and media. Alongside the Max HX, MSI also announced a Crosshair 16 HX variant, giving the Crosshair line a broader range of configurations aimed at mid-to-high-end gaming buyers.HP OmniBook Ultra 14HP claims the Omnibook Ultra 14 has passed 20 different MIL-STD 810H tests for things like extreme temperature and shock resistance.HP used CES 2026 to debut its new flagship consumer laptop, the OmniBook Ultra 14. It’s a premium ultraportable built around an ultra-thin but durability-focused design. The laptop measures just 0.42 inches thick and weighs 2.8 pounds, yet HP says it passes 20 MIL-STD-810 tests for shock, drops and extreme temperatures. Rather than a traditional unibody chassis, HP uses a forge-stamped aluminum construction designed to improve strength and bend resistance.The OmniBook Ultra 14 features a 3K OLED display and can be configured with up to 64GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Buyers can choose between Intel Core Ultra processors or Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite, with the Snapdragon version offering a more powerful NPU rated at up to 85 TOPS for AI workloads. HP has also added a vapor chamber for the first time in an OmniBook to support sustained performance in such a slim chassis.HP rounds things out with a large touchpad, quad speakers and three USB-C ports supporting Thunderbolt 4, DisplayPort 2.1 and fast charging. The OmniBook Ultra 14 is expected to go on sale later this month starting at $1,550.HP Omen Max 16HP also refreshed its gaming lineup at CES 2026 with the Omen Max 16, which the company describes as its most powerful 16-inch gaming laptop to date. The system is built around Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors and NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, with configurations reaching the high end of HP’s mobile performance offerings.Designed for sustained gaming workloads, the Omen Max 16 features expanded thermal headroom and high-refresh-rate displays aimed at competitive players. HP is positioning the laptop as the flagship of its Omen lineup, sitting above refreshed Omen 15 and Omen 16 models that target more mainstream gaming buyers.Pricing and availability for the Omen Max 16 have not yet been announced, with HP expected to share more details later this year.Acer Swift 16 AIPromo photo of the Acer Swift 16 AI laptopAcerAcer expanded its flagship Swift lineup at CES 2026 with the Swift 16 AI, a large-screen ultraportable that leans heavily into input innovation and display quality. The standout feature is what Acer says is the world’s largest haptic touchpad, which supports MPP 2.5 stylus input and is designed to improve precision for creative and productivity tasks.The Swift 16 AI features a 16-inch 3K OLED WQXGA+ touchscreen with HDR support, a 120Hz refresh rate and full DCI-P3 color coverage. It can be configured with up to an Intel Core Ultra X9 388H processor and Intel Arc B390 graphics, with up to 32GB of memory and 2TB of storage. Despite the large display, the laptop measures just 14.9mm thick and weighs about 3.4 pounds.Acer says the Swift 16 AI is part of the Copilot+ PC program, positioning it around on-device AI features alongside performance and portability. Pricing and availability have not yet been announced.Dell XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16Dell wouldn't let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here's a teaser it provided for CES. DellHaving a bit of déjà vu? You’re not alone. Dell killed its XPS branding last year only to bring it back this year after admitting it had made a mistake. Instead of simplifying its product offering, the rebranding only bewildered consumers and tech journalists alike, both of which had come to know the XPS lineup to be synonymous with quality. Now, Dell is getting back to its roots and coming out with a whole refreshed lineup of XPS laptops, including new XPS 13, XPS 14 and XPS 16 machines. Specific details for each model still remain under wraps, and there’s no word yet on when they will hit the market.Alienware gaming laptopsAlienware used CES 2026 to tease a new ultra-slim gaming laptop designed to sit below the company’s Area-51 flagships. The laptop measures roughly 17mm, or about 0.67 inches, thick and will be offered in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes.According to Alienware, the 16-inch version will feature NVIDIA discrete graphics paired with new, highly efficient CPUs. Rather than positioning it as a pure gaming machine, Alienware says the laptop is intended to balance gaming performance with creative work, productivity and everyday use.Alienware has not shared pricing, availability or full specifications, and it remains unclear how the 14-inch and 16-inch models will differ beyond size.Alienware also previewed a new entry-level gaming laptop aimed at expanding its reach to more budget-conscious players. While specs remain limited, the company says the system will deliver strong gaming performance at its most accessible price point yet.Alienware suggests pricing should come in below the $1,199 starting price of the Alienware 16 Aurora, potentially making it the most affordable gaming laptop the brand currently offers. As with the ultra-slim model, full details are expected later this year.Alienware Area-51 and AuroraAlongside its new teasers, Alienware announced updates to several existing laptops. The Alienware 16X Aurora and Alienware 16 Area-51 are gaining new anti-glare OLED panels with up to 620 nits of peak HDR brightness and a 0.2ms response time, as well as Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors.The Alienware 18 Area-51 is also being refreshed with the same CPUs. Alienware says the updated Alienware 16X Aurora, Alienware 16 Area-51 and Alienware 18 Area-51 laptops will be available in Q1 2026. Pricing has not yet been announced.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/all-the-laptops-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2026-160610752.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES 2026’s first official show day kept the pace up with a mix of near-term gaming upgrades, ambitious new form factors and a few reminders that not every gadget needs to do everything. NVIDIA announced important gaming news, we caught up with Samsung’s tri-fold phone and Lenovo marched out an army of impressive looking gaming laptops and concept tech. Here are the biggest stories from January 6.NVIDIANVIDIA's G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology.NVIDIANVIDIA’s gaming updates focused on making motion look cleaner and boosting performance without forcing developers to rebuild everything from scratch.The company introduced G-Sync Pulsar, a new display tech designed to reduce monitor-based motion blur by pulsing a screen’s backlight in sections rather than leaving it on continuously. NVIDIA says the approach gives pixels time to stabilize before they’re illuminated, which should make fast movement easier to track, particularly in esports.The first Pulsar monitors are expected to come out starting January 7 from Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI, all which are 27-inch 1440p IPS panels with a 360Hz refresh rate and up to 500 nits peak HDR brightness. Pulsar models also support Ambient Adaptive Technology for automatic color temperature and brightness adjustment based on room lighting.On the software side, NVIDIA announced DLSS 4.5, which adds a second-generation Transformer-based Super Resolution model the company says improves temporal stability, reduces ghosting and improves anti-aliasing. DLSS 4.5 also introduces Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, intended to push performance toward your display’s refresh rate, with NVIDIA positioning it around high-end targets like 4K 240Hz path tracing. The 2nd Gen Super Resolution Transformer model is available now for RTX GPUs, while Dynamic 6x Frame Generation is expected in spring 2026 for RTX 50-series cards, with support rolling out across hundreds of games via the NVIDIA app.SamsungThe Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung's growing lineup of fancy foldable phones.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold was unveiled in Asia before the show, but this was our first opportunity to see the superphone in person. It looked, at first glance, like the kind of idea that comes with obvious compromises: more weight, more thickness and a bigger price tag. In person, the pitch becomes easier to understand.The main draw is the 10-inch AMOLED display, which is a meaningful leap from the 8-inch inner screen on Samsung’s current book-style foldables. That extra real estate makes multitasking feel less cramped, and when paired with DeX, it starts to resemble a travel-friendly laptop alternative if you’re comfortable carrying a small keyboard and mouse. The TriFold’s 4:3 aspect ratio also helps for video and general productivity, with fewer awkward tradeoffs than the squarer inner screens Samsung has leaned on in recent generations.Samsung appears to have put real effort into the mechanics, too. The device uses two hinges and a magnet system designed to make opening and closing feel intuitive, with built-in warnings if you try to unfold it the wrong way. The obvious downsides are still there, including the bulk and cost, and it’s not clear how much thinner future versions can get when the USB-C port is effectively the limiting factor. For now, the TriFold is on sale in South Korea, with US and broader North American availability and pricing still pending.LenovoWhile it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLenovo arrived with a stack of concepts and a few more concrete products, making it clear that the company is still treating CES as its main playground for experimental form factors.The most striking concept was the Legion Pro Rollable, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.Lenovo also showed the XD Rollable concept, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view. It’s a clever way to avoid hiding unused panel real estate, even if the practical use cases still feel limited (maybe point-of-sale terminals?).On the handheld front, Lenovo confirmed the Legion Go 2, which will be powered by SteamOS and will arrive in June starting at $1,199. It keeps the same core hardware, including an 8.8-inch OLED 144Hz VRR display, detachable controllers, a kickstand and two configuration tiers based on Ryzen Z2 chips. The big change is swapping SteamOS in place of Windows, which should appeal to anyone who wants a more console-like experience, even if it remains a large device at 2.2 pounds.For laptops headed to market, Lenovo introduced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist, a notebook with a motorized display that can follow you during calls and presentations using a 10MP webcam and onboard AI. It also supports Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, up to 32GB RAM and 2TB storage, plus a strong port selection, and Lenovo says it starts at $1,649 with availability planned for June.Finally, Lenovo teased an AI smart glasses concept that looks more like normal eyewear than most show-floor prototypes. Lenovo says the glasses are designed for live translation, image recognition and notification summaries, with an eight-hour battery claim. As with many Lenovo concepts, there’s no firm timeline for a retail release.PebbleThe Pebble Round 2 reboots a smartwatch classic.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetPebble’s presence at CES this year felt like a counterpoint to the “more features, more sensors, more subscriptions” direction of other wearables.The Pebble Round 2 aims to revive the brand’s original appeal: a lightweight watch that supplements your phone rather than trying to replace it. The new model uses a 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen that runs to the edge of the case, with Pebble claiming two weeks of battery life in the 8.1mm-thick watch. It also makes deliberate tradeoffs, skipping GPS, a speaker and an optical heart rate sensor to keep the device thin and focused.Then there’s the Pebble Index 01, a simple AI ring built around a physical button you press to activate voice commands that you can use to ask questions, set reminders and the like. The pitch is reducing friction: no wake words, no gestures you have to get right every time. Pebble says the ring is water resistant and not rechargeable, instead using a sealed battery designed to last years depending on usage, with replacement handled when the battery is nearing the end of its life. It’s available for pre-order at an early bird price of $75, with shipping planned for May.SegwaySegway expanded its presence well beyond scooters with two very different pitches: smarter yard care and more tech-forward e-bikes.Under its Navimow brand, Segway introduced a new lineup of robotic lawn mowers spanning multiple tiers, including the X4 Series for large yards up to 1.5 acres with AWD and dual cutting motors, plus the more mainstream i2 Series with AWD and LiDAR options. Segway says pre-orders for the i2 AWD and X4 models begin January 16, with pricing ranging from around $1,000 to $3,000 depending on configuration.On the mobility side, Segway announced two new e-bikes, the Myon and Muxi, along with an electric dirt bike called the Xaber 300. The headline is the company’s focus on sensor-driven ride smoothing, smart features like Find My integration and app-based controls, and tech meant to make starts, hills and traction feel more predictable. The Myon is available now for $2,000, while the Muxi is expected in March for $1,700.MetaMeta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.Karissa Bell for EngadgetMeta’s EMG wristband (that’s short for “electromyography,” the ability to recognize and translate small finger and wrist gestures) is starting to look like more than a companion accessory for smart glasses. Meta showed how its wrist-based neural controller could be used beyond its own eyewear, including an early demo with Garmin inside a concept car cockpit. The interaction was still basic — swipe and pinch gestures to navigate apps on an infotainment screen — but the larger idea is hands-free control of vehicle functions over time.Meta also highlighted research work exploring how EMG control could help people with conditions that limit hand mobility interact with smart home devices like speakers, blinds and thermostats. If day one of the show had a theme beyond AI, it was that companies are still willing to gamble on new shapes and inputs, and they can work as long as they feel practical and immediately useful.RazerRazer's concept immersive gaming chair with light strips along the head cushions is pictured in front of a desk in a rocky outdoor environment between large puddlesRazerRazer’s day-one news was split between a full-blown immersion concept and a more grounded chair refresh.The company’s Project Madison concept is a gaming chair designed as a multisensory rig, combining reactive lighting, spatial audio and multi-zone haptics to match on-screen action. It’s not a product you can buy, but it’s a clear statement about where Razer thinks the “setup” category could go.Razer also showed Project Motoko, a concept headset meant to blur the line between gaming gear and an AI wearable. It includes cameras for real-time object and text recognition and is designed to work with multiple AI assistants, with Razer positioning it as a platform that could eventually ship first as a developer kit and later as a retail product.BirdbuddyTwo new Birdbuddy smart bird feeders displayed at CES.Amy Skorheim for EngadgetBirdbuddy added a feature that makes its smart feeders feel closer to a true nature companion: birdsong identification. The Birdbuddy 2 and Birdbuddy 2 Mini both add microphones that help the system identify species by sound, alongside the usual camera-based detection. Birdbuddy also says the new models improve camera wake-up speed, use a more modular design for easier cleaning and protect the lens with Gorilla Glass since birds have a habit of pecking at it.The Birdbuddy 2 is priced at $199 and is expected to ship pre-orders in February, with wider availability mid-2026, while the Birdbuddy 2 Mini costs $129 with pre-orders planned for summer.AgibotHumanoid robots are having another moment at CES this year, and Agibot’s demos leaned into movement, personality and practical service roles.The company brought two robots, the larger A2 and smaller X2, both capable of walking around the floor, waving to attendees and dancing with surprising confidence. Agibot described the A2 as a potential hospitality helper for places like museums or conferences, while the X2 is framed more as an educational platform with slightly more human-like movement. Agibot also says its robots can learn actions from video, including training dance routines from TikTok clips, and the company plans to make its robots available in the US this year, though pricing and broader availability details weren’t shared.Day one is in the books, but CES 2026 is far from over. With the show floor now fully open, expect more hands-ons, deeper dives and plenty of unexpected demos as the week continues, especially across laptops, wearables, mobility and smart home tech. We’ll be updating our CES coverage daily, with liveblogs, reviews and show-floor impressions throughout the week. You can follow along on Engadget for the latest news as it happens.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-day-1-the-biggest-tech-news-and-gadgets-you-missed-from-the-first-official-day-of-the-show-144040174.html?src=rss",
          "content": "CES 2026’s first official show day kept the pace up with a mix of near-term gaming upgrades, ambitious new form factors and a few reminders that not every gadget needs to do everything. NVIDIA announced important gaming news, we caught up with Samsung’s tri-fold phone and Lenovo marched out an army of impressive looking gaming laptops and concept tech. Here are the biggest stories from January 6.NVIDIANVIDIA's G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology.NVIDIANVIDIA’s gaming updates focused on making motion look cleaner and boosting performance without forcing developers to rebuild everything from scratch.The company introduced G-Sync Pulsar, a new display tech designed to reduce monitor-based motion blur by pulsing a screen’s backlight in sections rather than leaving it on continuously. NVIDIA says the approach gives pixels time to stabilize before they’re illuminated, which should make fast movement easier to track, particularly in esports.The first Pulsar monitors are expected to come out starting January 7 from Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI, all which are 27-inch 1440p IPS panels with a 360Hz refresh rate and up to 500 nits peak HDR brightness. Pulsar models also support Ambient Adaptive Technology for automatic color temperature and brightness adjustment based on room lighting.On the software side, NVIDIA announced DLSS 4.5, which adds a second-generation Transformer-based Super Resolution model the company says improves temporal stability, reduces ghosting and improves anti-aliasing. DLSS 4.5 also introduces Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, intended to push performance toward your display’s refresh rate, with NVIDIA positioning it around high-end targets like 4K 240Hz path tracing. The 2nd Gen Super Resolution Transformer model is available now for RTX GPUs, while Dynamic 6x Frame Generation is expected in spring 2026 for RTX 50-series cards, with support rolling out across hundreds of games via the NVIDIA app.SamsungThe Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung's growing lineup of fancy foldable phones.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold was unveiled in Asia before the show, but this was our first opportunity to see the superphone in person. It looked, at first glance, like the kind of idea that comes with obvious compromises: more weight, more thickness and a bigger price tag. In person, the pitch becomes easier to understand.The main draw is the 10-inch AMOLED display, which is a meaningful leap from the 8-inch inner screen on Samsung’s current book-style foldables. That extra real estate makes multitasking feel less cramped, and when paired with DeX, it starts to resemble a travel-friendly laptop alternative if you’re comfortable carrying a small keyboard and mouse. The TriFold’s 4:3 aspect ratio also helps for video and general productivity, with fewer awkward tradeoffs than the squarer inner screens Samsung has leaned on in recent generations.Samsung appears to have put real effort into the mechanics, too. The device uses two hinges and a magnet system designed to make opening and closing feel intuitive, with built-in warnings if you try to unfold it the wrong way. The obvious downsides are still there, including the bulk and cost, and it’s not clear how much thinner future versions can get when the USB-C port is effectively the limiting factor. For now, the TriFold is on sale in South Korea, with US and broader North American availability and pricing still pending.LenovoWhile it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLenovo arrived with a stack of concepts and a few more concrete products, making it clear that the company is still treating CES as its main playground for experimental form factors.The most striking concept was the Legion Pro Rollable, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9.

          "standfirst": "French startup WheelMove demonstrated a compact motorized wheelchair add-on at CES 2026 that not only acts as a power-assist device, but can also lift up a chair's small front wheels so it can ride over rough terrain. The accessory upgrades a manual wheelchair with a 10-inch extra wheel and a 250W motor that can drive at up to six miles per hour (10 kilometers per hour) and handle slopes up to 10 percent, with a range of 15.5 miles (25km). The battery is swappable, too, so a person could pack an extra for a longer outing to avoid having to stop and recharge. As the WheelMove team showed at its booth, the accessory can be attached to a wheelchair in a matter of seconds while seated, and its control panel can be strapped onto an armrest or even a bodypart. There are five speed options, which also work to keep the speed consistent when a person is traveling on a downslope. With the WheelMove attached, its creators say a manual wheelchair user can traverse rough and uneven surfaces — like cobblestones, grass and dirt paths — as well as ramps with far less effort than would normally be required. In some cases, it could open up travel in places that would otherwise be completely inaccessible. The startup says it's worked with wheelchair users who have field tested the device for months ahead of its launch. It weighs less than eight kilograms (17.6 lbs) and packs up in a backpack. Pre-orders for the WheelMove have opened for buyers in France, where it's expected to ship later this year before expanding internationally. It costs roughly $6,000.

I certainly have a collection with one flimsy plastic sack filled with dozens or hundreds of others. I plan to do something with it… eventually. Unfortunately, there aren’t a ton of options for what to do with those soft plastics, as most recycling facilities can’t accept them. But no one likes seeing them end up in oceans and rivers and stuck up in trees. So I was excited to see the Clear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (CPC) at CES. It’s a pre-recycler for your home that turns hundreds of bags into a solid brick that’s easier to transport. Certain facilities can accept the bricks for recycling. Clear Drop works with 95 percent of soft plastics, sucking up bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks, package wrap and cling film into its maw. It then compresses and heats the plastic to form a compact eight by twelve by four inch brick. I asked Matt Daly, Clear Drop’s head of product, what the compactor can’t take and I was told you can’t add ping pong balls, IV bags and camera film. Easy enough. A compacted brick the Clear Drop CPC produced. Amy Skorheim for Engadget It was satisfying to see the little slot on the top gobble up the plastic bags Daly fed it. The Clear Drop wasn’t set to smash and heat at the show, but I was assured by another Clear Drop rep that any plastic smell produced during operation was minimal and the company performed safety tests to ensure the machine didn’t create any harmful emissions. Daly said it would take about a month for most households to create a brick, which translates to around a 30 gallon trash bag full of other bags. Once that brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities and pre-paid USPS shipping envelops are included. They work with multiple US-based recycling facilities and do audits to ensure the bricks are actually being recycled. Of course, I was a little disappointed the bricks couldn’t be tossed in my blue curbside bin, but Daly said they’re working to bring more recycling partners on board and the ultimate goal is to create an infrastructure that would eventually include municipal recycling. Shipping the bricks somewhere feels a little counterproductive, eco-wise. And the machine itself is not cheap. The price is split up over the course of two years, but it adds up to $1,400. I’m happy to see someone somewhere is doing something to address a pretty clear problem. While it’s not perfect, this is probably the best household-level solution I’ve seen to that can ensure your bags don’t go down some sea turtle’s throat.

          "standfirst": "In the fast-moving world of AI development, it is rare for a tool to be described as both \"a meme\" and AGI, artificial generalized intelligence, the \"holy grail\" of a model or system that can reliably outperform humans on economically valuable work. Yet, that is exactly where the Ralph Wiggum plugin for Claude Code now sits. Named after the infamously high-pitched, hapless yet persistent character on The Simpsons, this newish tool (released in summer 2025) — and the philosophy behind it — has set the developer community on X (formerly Twitter) into a tizzy of excitement over the last few weeks.For power users of Anthropic’s hit agentic, quasi-autonomous coding platform Claude Code, Wiggum represents a shift from \"chatting\" with AI to managing autonomous \"night shifts.\" It is a crude but effective step toward agentic coding, transforming the AI from a pair programmer into a relentless worker that doesn’t stop until the job is done.Origin Story: A Tale of Two RalphsTo understand the \"Ralph\" tool is to understand a new approach toward improving autonomous AI coding performance — one that relies on brute force, failure, and repetition as much as it does on raw intelligence and reasoning. Because Ralph Wiggum is not merely a Simpsons character anymore; it is a methodology born on a goat farm and refined in a San Francisco research lab, a divergence best documented in the conversations between its creator and the broader developer community.The story begins in roughly May 2025 with Geoffrey Huntley, a longtime open source software developer who pivoted to raising goats in rural Australia. Huntley was frustrated by a fundamental limitation in the agentic coding workflow: the \"human-in-the-loop\" bottleneck. He realized that while models were capable, they were hamstrung by the user’s need to manually review and re-prompt every error. Huntley’s solution was elegantly brutish. He wrote a 5-line Bash script that he jokingly named after Ralph Wiggum, the dim-witted but relentlessly optimistic and undeterred character from The Simpsons.As Huntley explained in his initial release blog post \"Ralph Wiggum as a &#x27;software engineer,&#x27;\" the idea relied on Context Engineering.By piping the model’s entire output—failures, stack traces, and hallucinations—back into its own input stream for the next iteration, Huntley created a \"contextual pressure cooker.\"This philosophy was further dissected in a recent conversation with Dexter Horthy, co-founder and CEO of the enterprise AI engineering firm HumanLayer, posted on YouTube.Horthy and Huntley argue that the power of the original Ralph wasn&#x27;t just in the looping, but in its \"naive persistence\" — the unsanitized feedback, in which the LLM isn&#x27;t protected from its own mess; it is forced to confront it. It embodies the philosophy that if you press the model hard enough against its own failures without a safety net, it will eventually \"dream\" a correct solution just to escape the loop.By late 2025, Boris Cherny, Anthropic&#x27;s Head of Claude Code* formalized the hack into the official ralph-wiggum plugin. However, as noted by critics in the Horthy/Huntley discussion, the official release marked a shift in philosophy—a \"sterilization\" of the original chaotic concept.While Huntley’s script was about brute force, the official Anthropic plugin was designed around the principle that \"Failures Are Data.\" In the official documentation, the distinction is clear. The Anthropic implementation utilizes a specialized \"Stop Hook\"—a mechanism that intercepts the AI&#x27;s attempt to exit the CLI.Intercept the Exit: When Claude thinks it is done, the plugin pauses execution.Verify Promise: It checks for a specific \"Completion Promise\" (e.g., \"All tests passed\").Feedback Injection: If the promise isn&#x27;t met, the failure is formatted as a structured data object.The \"Tale of Two Ralphs\" offers a critical choice for modern power users:The \"Huntley Ralph\" (Bash Script/Community Forks): Best for chaotic, creative exploration where you want the AI to solve problems through sheer, unbridled persistence.The \"Official Ralph\" (Anthropic Plugin): The standard for enterprise workflows, strictly bound by token limits and safety hooks, designed to fix broken builds reliably without the risk of an infinite hallucination loop.In short: Huntley proved the loop was possible; Anthropic proved it could be safe.What It Offers: The Night Shift for CodersThe documentation is clear on where Ralph shines: new projects and tasks with automatic verification (like tests or linters). But for the \"boring stuff,\" the efficiency gains are becoming the stuff of legend. According to the official plugin documentation on GitHub, the technique has already logged some eye-watering wins. In one case, a developer reportedly completed a $50,000 contract for just $297 in API costs—essentially arbitraging the difference between an expensive human lawyer/coder and a relentless AI loop.The repository also highlights a Y Combinator hackathon stress test where the tool \"successfully generated 6 repositories overnight,\" effectively allowing a single developer to output a small team&#x27;s worth of boilerplate while asleep. Meanwhile, on X, community members like ynkzlk have shared screenshots of Ralph handling the kind of maintenance work engineers dread, such as a 14-hour autonomous session that upgraded a stale codebase from React v16 to v19 entirely without human input.To make this work safely, power users rely on a specific architecture.

          "standfirst": "The arms race to build smarter AI models has a measurement problem: the tests used to rank them are becoming obsolete almost as quickly as the models improve. On Monday, Artificial Analysis, an independent AI benchmarking organization whose rankings are closely watched by developers and enterprise buyers, released a major overhaul to its Intelligence Index that fundamentally changes how the industry measures AI progress.The new Intelligence Index v4.0 incorporates 10 evaluations spanning agents, coding, scientific reasoning, and general knowledge. But the changes go far deeper than shuffling test names. The organization removed three staple benchmarks — MMLU-Pro, AIME 2025, and LiveCodeBench — that have long been cited by AI companies in their marketing materials. In their place, the new index introduces evaluations designed to measure whether AI systems can complete the kind of work that people actually get paid to do.type: embedded-entry-inline id: 1bCmRrroGCdUb07IuaHysL\"This index shift reflects a broader transition: intelligence is being measured less by recall and more by economically useful action,\" observed Aravind Sundar, a researcher who responded to the announcement on X (formerly Twitter).Why AI benchmarks are breaking: The problem with tests that top models have already masteredThe benchmark overhaul addresses a growing crisis in AI evaluation: the leading models have become so capable that traditional tests can no longer meaningfully differentiate between them. The new index deliberately makes the curve harder to climb. According to Artificial Analysis, top models now score 50 or below on the new v4.0 scale, compared to 73 on the previous version — a recalibration designed to restore headroom for future improvement.This saturation problem has plagued the industry for months. When every frontier model scores in the 90th percentile on a given test, the test loses its usefulness as a decision-making tool for enterprises trying to choose which AI system to deploy. The new methodology attempts to solve this by weighting four categories equally — Agents, Coding, Scientific Reasoning, and Genera l— while introducing evaluations where even the most advanced systems still struggle.The results under the new framework show OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning effort claiming the top spot, followed closely by Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 and Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro. OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as \"the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work,\" while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 scores higher than GPT-5.2 on SWE-Bench Verified, a test set evaluating software coding abilities.GDPval-AA: The new benchmark testing whether AI can do your jobThe most significant addition to the new index is GDPval-AA, an evaluation based on OpenAI&#x27;s GDPval dataset that tests AI models on real-world economically valuable tasks across 44 occupations and 9 major industries. Unlike traditional benchmarks that ask models to solve abstract math problems or answer multiple-choice trivia, GDPval-AA measures whether AI can produce the deliverables that professionals actually create: documents, slides, diagrams, spreadsheets, and multimedia content.Models receive shell access and web browsing capabilities through what Artificial Analysis calls \"Stirrup,\" its reference agentic harness. Scores are derived from blind pairwise comparisons, with ELO ratings frozen at the time of evaluation to ensure index stability.Under this framework, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning leads with an ELO score of 1442, while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 non-thinking variant follows at 1403. Claude Sonnet 4.5 trails at 1259.On the original GDPval evaluation, GPT-5.2 beat or tied top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified tasks, according to OpenAI. The company claims GPT-5.2 \"outperforms industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations,\" with companies including Notion, Box, Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom observing \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning and tool-calling performance.\"The emphasis on economically measurable output is a philosophical shift in how the industry thinks about AI capability. Rather than asking whether a model can pass a bar exam or solve competition math problems — achievements that generate headlines but don&#x27;t necessarily translate to workplace productivity — the new benchmarks ask whether AI can actually do jobs.Graduate-level physics problems expose the limits of today&#x27;s most advanced AI modelsWhile GDPval-AA measures practical productivity, another new evaluation called CritPT reveals just how far AI systems remain from true scientific reasoning. The benchmark tests language models on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks across modern physics, including condensed matter, quantum physics, and astrophysics.CritPT was developed by more than 50 active physics researchers from over 30 leading institutions. Its 71 composite research challenges simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level — comparable to the warm-up exercises a hands-on principal investigator might assign to junior graduate students. Every problem is hand-curated to produce a guess-resistant, machine-verifiable answer.The results are sobering. Current state-of-the-art models remain far from reliably solving full research-scale challenges. GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning leads the CritPT leaderboard with a score of just 11.5%, followed by Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro Preview and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking variant. These scores suggest that despite remarkable progress on consumer-facing tasks, AI systems still struggle with the kind of deep reasoning required for scientific discovery.AI hallucination rates: Why the most accurate models aren&#x27;t always the most trustworthyPerhaps the most revealing new evaluation is AA-Omniscience, which measures factual recall and hallucination across 6,000 questions covering 42 economically relevant topics within six domains: Business, Health, Law, Software Engineering, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Science/Engineering/Mathematics.The evaluation produces an Omniscience Index that rewards precise knowledge while penalizing hallucinated responses — providing insight into whether a model can distinguish what it knows from what it doesn&#x27;t. The findings expose an uncomfortable truth: high accuracy does not guarantee low hallucination. Models with the highest accuracy often fail to lead on the Omniscience Index because they tend to guess rather than abstain when uncertain.Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro Preview leads the Omniscience Index with a score of 13, followed by Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking and Gemini 3 Flash Reasoning, both at 10. However, the breakdown between accuracy and hallucination rates reveals a more complex picture.On raw accuracy, Google&#x27;s two models lead with scores of 54% and 51% respectively, followed by Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking at 43%. But Google&#x27;s models also demonstrate higher hallucination rates than peer models, scoring 88% and 85%. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking and Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking show hallucination rates of 48% and 58% respectively, while GPT-5.1 with high reasoning effort achieves 51%—the second-lowest hallucination rate tested.Both Omniscience Accuracy and Hallucination Rate contribute 6.25% weighting each to the overall Intelligence Index v4.Inside the AI arms race: How OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic stack up under new testingThe benchmark reshuffling arrives at an especially turbulent moment in the AI industry. All three leading frontier model developers have launched major new models within just a few weeks — and Gemini 3 still holds the top spot on much of the leaderboards on LMArena, a widely cited benchmarking tool used to compare LLMs.Google&#x27;s November release of Gemini 3 prompted OpenAI to declare a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. OpenAI is counting on its GPT family of models to justify its $500 billion valuation and over $1.4 trillion in planned spending. \"We announced this code red to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area,\" said Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI. Altman told CNBC he expected OpenAI to exit its code red by January.Anthropic responded with Claude Opus 4.5 on November 24, achieving an SWE-Bench Verified accuracy score of 80.9% — reclaiming the coding crown from both GPT-5.1-Codex-Max and Gemini 3. The launch marked Anthropic&#x27;s third major model release in two months. Microsoft and Nvidia have since announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic, boosting its valuation to about $350 billion.How Artificial Analysis tests AI models: A look at the independent benchmarking processArtificial Analysis emphasizes that all evaluations are run independently using a standardized methodology. The organization states that its \"methodology emphasizes fairness and real-world applicability,\" estimating a 95% confidence interval for the Intelligence Index of less than ±1% based on experiments with more than 10 repeats on certain models.The organization&#x27;s published methodology defines key terms that enterprise buyers should understand. According to the methodology documentation, Artificial Analysis considers an \"endpoint\" to be a hosted instance of a model accessible via an API — meaning a single model may have multiple endpoints across different providers. A \"provider\" is a company that hosts and provides access to one or more model endpoints or systems. Critically, Artificial Analysis distinguishes between \"open weights\" models, whose weights have been released publicly, and truly open-source models—noting that many open LLMs have been released with licenses that do not meet the full definition of open-source software.The methodology also clarifies how the organization standardizes token measurement: it uses OpenAI tokens as measured with OpenAI&#x27;s tiktoken package as a standard unit across all providers to enable fair comparisons.What the new AI Intelligence Index means for enterprise technology decisions in 2026For technical decision-makers evaluating AI systems, the Intelligence Index v4.0 provides a more nuanced picture of capability than previous benchmark compilations. The equal weighting across agents, coding, scientific reasoning, and general knowledge means that enterprises with specific use cases may want to examine category-specific scores rather than relying solely on the aggregate index.The introduction of hallucination measurement as a distinct, weighted factor addresses one of the most persistent concerns in enterprise AI adoption. A model that appears highly accurate but frequently hallucinates when uncertain poses significant risks in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and law.The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index is described as \"a text-only, English language evaluation suite.\" The organization benchmarks models for image inputs, speech inputs, and multilingual performance separately.The response to the announcement has been largely positive. \"It is great to see the index evolving to reduce saturation and focus more on agentic performance,\" wrote one commenter in an X.com post. \"Including real-world tasks like GDPval-AA makes the scores much more relevant for practical use.\"Others struck a more ambitious note. \"The new wave of models that is just about to come will leave them all behind,\" predicted one observer. \"By the end of the year the singularity will be undeniable.\"But whether that prediction proves prophetic or premature, one thing is already clear: the era of judging AI by how well it answers test questions is ending. The new standard is simpler and far more consequential — can it do the work?",

Rather than asking whether a model can pass a bar exam or solve competition math problems — achievements that generate headlines but don&#x27;t necessarily translate to workplace productivity — the new benchmarks ask whether AI can actually do jobs.Graduate-level physics problems expose the limits of today&#x27;s most advanced AI modelsWhile GDPval-AA measures practical productivity, another new evaluation called CritPT reveals just how far AI systems remain from true scientific reasoning. The benchmark tests language models on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks across modern physics, including condensed matter, quantum physics, and astrophysics.CritPT was developed by more than 50 active physics researchers from over 30 leading institutions. Its 71 composite research challenges simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level — comparable to the warm-up exercises a hands-on principal investigator might assign to junior graduate students. Every problem is hand-curated to produce a guess-resistant, machine-verifiable answer.The results are sobering. Current state-of-the-art models remain far from reliably solving full research-scale challenges. GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning leads the CritPT leaderboard with a score of just 11.5%, followed by Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro Preview and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking variant. These scores suggest that despite remarkable progress on consumer-facing tasks, AI systems still struggle with the kind of deep reasoning required for scientific discovery.AI hallucination rates: Why the most accurate models aren&#x27;t always the most trustworthyPerhaps the most revealing new evaluation is AA-Omniscience, which measures factual recall and hallucination across 6,000 questions covering 42 economically relevant topics within six domains: Business, Health, Law, Software Engineering, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Science/Engineering/Mathematics.The evaluation produces an Omniscience Index that rewards precise knowledge while penalizing hallucinated responses — providing insight into whether a model can distinguish what it knows from what it doesn&#x27;t. The findings expose an uncomfortable truth: high accuracy does not guarantee low hallucination. Models with the highest accuracy often fail to lead on the Omniscience Index because they tend to guess rather than abstain when uncertain.Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro Preview leads the Omniscience Index with a score of 13, followed by Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking and Gemini 3 Flash Reasoning, both at 10. However, the breakdown between accuracy and hallucination rates reveals a more complex picture.On raw accuracy, Google&#x27;s two models lead with scores of 54% and 51% respectively, followed by Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking at 43%. But Google&#x27;s models also demonstrate higher hallucination rates than peer models, scoring 88% and 85%. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking and Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking show hallucination rates of 48% and 58% respectively, while GPT-5.1 with high reasoning effort achieves 51%—the second-lowest hallucination rate tested.Both Omniscience Accuracy and Hallucination Rate contribute 6.25% weighting each to the overall Intelligence Index v4.Inside the AI arms race: How OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic stack up under new testingThe benchmark reshuffling arrives at an especially turbulent moment in the AI industry. All three leading frontier model developers have launched major new models within just a few weeks — and Gemini 3 still holds the top spot on much of the leaderboards on LMArena, a widely cited benchmarking tool used to compare LLMs.Google&#x27;s November release of Gemini 3 prompted OpenAI to declare a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. OpenAI is counting on its GPT family of models to justify its $500 billion valuation and over $1.4 trillion in planned spending. \"We announced this code red to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area,\" said Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI. Altman told CNBC he expected OpenAI to exit its code red by January.Anthropic responded with Claude Opus 4.5 on November 24, achieving an SWE-Bench Verified accuracy score of 80.9% — reclaiming the coding crown from both GPT-5.1-Codex-Max and Gemini 3. The launch marked Anthropic&#x27;s third major model release in two months. Microsoft and Nvidia have since announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic, boosting its valuation to about $350 billion.How Artificial Analysis tests AI models: A look at the independent benchmarking processArtificial Analysis emphasizes that all evaluations are run independently using a standardized methodology. The organization states that its \"methodology emphasizes fairness and real-world applicability,\" estimating a 95% confidence interval for the Intelligence Index of less than ±1% based on experiments with more than 10 repeats on certain models.The organization&#x27;s published methodology defines key terms that enterprise buyers should understand. According to the methodology documentation, Artificial Analysis considers an \"endpoint\" to be a hosted instance of a model accessible via an API — meaning a single model may have multiple endpoints across different providers. A \"provider\" is a company that hosts and provides access to one or more model endpoints or systems. Critically, Artificial Analysis distinguishes between \"open weights\" models, whose weights have been released publicly, and truly open-source models—noting that many open LLMs have been released with licenses that do not meet the full definition of open-source software.The methodology also clarifies how the organization standardizes token measurement: it uses OpenAI tokens as measured with OpenAI&#x27;s tiktoken package as a standard unit across all providers to enable fair comparisons.What the new AI Intelligence Index means for enterprise technology decisions in 2026For technical decision-makers evaluating AI systems, the Intelligence Index v4.0 provides a more nuanced picture of capability than previous benchmark compilations. The equal weighting across agents, coding, scientific reasoning, and general knowledge means that enterprises with specific use cases may want to examine category-specific scores rather than relying solely on the aggregate index.The introduction of hallucination measurement as a distinct, weighted factor addresses one of the most persistent concerns in enterprise AI adoption. A model that appears highly accurate but frequently hallucinates when uncertain poses significant risks in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and law.The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index is described as \"a text-only, English language evaluation suite.\" The organization benchmarks models for image inputs, speech inputs, and multilingual performance separately.The response to the announcement has been largely positive. \"It is great to see the index evolving to reduce saturation and focus more on agentic performance,\" wrote one commenter in an X.com post. \"Including real-world tasks like GDPval-AA makes the scores much more relevant for practical use.\"Others struck a more ambitious note. \"The new wave of models that is just about to come will leave them all behind,\" predicted one observer. \"By the end of the year the singularity will be undeniable.\"But whether that prediction proves prophetic or premature, one thing is already clear: the era of judging AI by how well it answers test questions is ending. The new standard is simpler and far more consequential — can it do the work?",

Now that it has a few iterations of modern flip phones under its belt, Moto is embarking on a new challenge: big foldables. The new (and thoroughly leaked) Motorola Razr Fold is a book-style foldable like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Google's Pixel Fold lines, offering a smartphone-sized external display with a big foldable panel inside. Motorola is taking the opportunity to reveal the phone at CES, but it's far from ready for launch. Currently, Motorola is aiming to release the Razr Fold this coming summer for an unknown amount of money—Motorola won't confirm pricing or really much of anything about the Razr Fold at this time. What we do know is the device will be about as big as other large foldable phones, featuring a 6.6-inch external display and an 8.1-inch internal one. Moto says the main foldable OLED panel will have a 2K resolution, which means roughly 2,000 pixels tall. Again, this is similar to existing foldables.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The Warner Bros. Discovery board has unanimously voted to rebuff Paramount's $108.4 billion offer and urged shareholders to reject the hostile takeover bid. The board is continuing to support Netflix's pending $82.7 billion purchase of its streaming and movie studios businesses along with a separate spinoff of the Warner Bros. cable TV division. Warner Bros. called the Paramount bid \"illusory\" in a presentation for shareholders today, saying the offer requires an \"extraordinary amount of debt financing\" and other terms that make it less likely to be completed than a Netflix merger. It would be the largest leveraged buyout ever, \"with $87B of total pro forma gross debt,\" and is \"effectively a one-sided option for PSKY [Paramount Skydance] as the offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time,\" Warner Bros. said. The Warner Bros. presentation touted Netflix's financial strength while saying that Paramount \"is a $14B market cap company with a 'junk' credit rating, negative free cash flows, significant fixed financial obligations, and a high degree of dependency on its linear business.\" The Paramount \"offer is illusory as it cannot be completed before it is currently scheduled to expire,\" Warner Bros. said.Read full article Comments",

And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well. A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn't exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago. When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games. Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS's footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.Read full article Comments",

While that might sound rather meager, it's a 40 percent increase from 2025's survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV. Plain old internal combustion remains Americans' first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that's how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent). A graph showing preference for engine type in car buyers' next vehicle. Credit: Deloitte The high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren't all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.Read full article Comments",

Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is. A whistleblower reportedly alerted the Nuclear Regulation Authority in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data. Based on an English translation, it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled earthquake motions and find the one that best represents the average among the 20.Read full article Comments",

That's mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market. But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur's complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials. Sulfur chemistry Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that's not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it's also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.Read full article Comments",

Or, more precisely, “total world assistance” or “intelligent amplification, if you want.” Domination “sounds scary with AI,” he acknowledges.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Last year delivered doses of drama and excitement in the space business, with a record number of launches, breathtaking vistas of other worlds, and a multitude of breakthroughs and setbacks. 2026 is shaping up to be another thrilling year in the cosmos. For the first time in more than 54 years, astronauts are training to travel to the vicinity of the Moon, perhaps within the next couple of months. NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other companies are poised to take major steps toward actually landing humans on the Moon, perhaps within a few years. New rockets are slated to debut in 2026, and scientists hope to open new windows on the Universe. Here, we list the most anticipated space missions scheduled for this year, ranked according to our own anticipation for them. We also assess the chances of these missions actually happening in the next 12 months. Unless specified, we don't assess the chances of a successful outcome.Read full article Comments",

The Commodore 64 made the keyboard-PC famous in the 1980s, but the keyboard-PC space has been dominated by the Raspberry Pi. In 2019, the single-board computer (SBC) maker released the Raspberry Pi 400, which is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 SBC inside a case that also functions as a keyboard for the system. USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, plus a GPIO header and native Raspberry Pi OS Linux distribution add up to a low-end desktop computer experience that only costs $100. It was followed by the Raspberry Pi 500, with a Pi 5 powered by a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 inside; and the Pi 500+, which has an NVMe SSD, instead of microSD, storage and is built inside of a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also twice as expensive at $200).

          "content": "For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang's characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed 90-minute keynote focused almost entirely on the company's dominant AI business, relegating the company's gaming-related announcements to a separate video posted later in the evening. Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia's basket of upscaling and frame-generation technologies. DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new \"second-generation transformer model\" that Nvidia says has been \"trained on an expanded data set\" to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia's Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it's working from a lower-resolution source image.Read full article Comments",
