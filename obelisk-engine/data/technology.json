          "content": "Roughly two years ago, Sam Altman tweeted that AI systems would be capable of superhuman persuasion well before achieving general intelligence—a prediction that raised concerns about the influence AI could have over democratic elections. To see if conversational large language models can really sway political views of the public, scientists at the UK AI Security Institute, MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and many other institutions performed by far the largest study on AI persuasiveness to date, involving nearly 80,000 participants in the UK. It turned out political AI chatbots fell far short of superhuman persuasiveness, but the study raises some more nuanced issues about our interactions with AI. AI dystopias The public debate about the impact AI has on politics has largely revolved around notions drawn from dystopian sci-fi. Large language models have access to essentially every fact and story ever published about any issue or candidate. They have processed information from books on psychology, negotiations, and human manipulation. They can rely on absurdly high computing power in huge data centers worldwide. On top of that, they can often access tons of personal information about individual users thanks to hundreds upon hundreds of online interactions at their disposal.Read full article Comments",

          "standfirst": "Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. is, in many ways, the last thing a weakened Hollywood needs right now. The industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, where theaters were forced to close and audiences became even more comfortable with streaming films at home. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023, which were driven by legitimate concerns around studio interest in generative AI, delayed production and promotion of many film and TV projects. And the rise of streaming content pushed many media companies towards taking on debt and unwise mergers (see: Warner Bros. Discovery), which led to higher subscription costs, layoffs and production belt-tightening.How can a troubled media company survive today? The answer seems to be further consolidation. Amazon's $8.45 billion MGM takeover in 2022 heralded future deals, like Skydance's $8 billion acquisition of Paramount . But Netflix's WB deal goes even further: It could fundamentally reshape the media industry as we know it, from theatrical movie-going to the existence of physical media.What will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal include? After next year's already-announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery, Netflix says it plans to acquire all of Warner Bros. remaining assets — including its film and TV studios, HBO Max and HBO — for $82.7 billion. According to Game Developer, representatives also say Warner Bros. Games, which includes Mortal Kombat developers NetherRealm, will also be part of the deal. Will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal be approved by regulators?Even before the deal was formally announced, it was clear that whoever bought WB would be facing government opposition from every side. Yesterday, Paramount sent WB a letter questioning the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the acquisition bidding process (which also included Comcast as a potential buyer). Afterwards, the New York Post reported that Paramount CEO David Ellison, son of the Trump-boosting Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, met with administration officials to make his case for buying Netflix. As of this morning, the Trump administration views the Netflix/WB deal with \"heavy skepticism,\" an official tells CNBC.On the other side of the aisle, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called the Netflix/WB deal an \"anti-monopoly nightmare.\" She added, \"A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk.\" At this point, it's too early to tell if the Netflix/WB deal will make it past regulators, but it's clear that both companies should prepare for a rocky approval process.What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for streaming video? According to data from JustWatch, a combined Netflix and HBO would account for 33 percent of the US streaming video market, putting it ahead of Prime Video's 21 percent share. As for how the two media companies would co-exist, Netflix says it will \"maintain Warner Bros. current businesses,\" which includes HBO Max and HBO, theatrical releases for films and well as movie and TV studio operations. JustWatch streaming video market stats.JustWatch\"We think it’s too early to talk specifics about how we’re going to tailor this offering for consumers,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in an investor call this morning, when asked if HBO would remain a separate service. \"Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful, and would constitute part of our plan for consumers. That then gives us a lot of options to figure out how to package things to offer the best options for consumers.\"At the very least, we can expect increased prices across the board for HBO and Netflix. There's also potential for the company to offer combination subscriptions, similar to how Disney juggles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for theaters?In short, a combined Netflix/WB wouldn't be great for theaters. Previous mergers, like Disney and Fox's union, led to fewer theatrical releases, not more. Since its transformation into a streaming-first company, Netflix has also been primarily focused on increasing subscriptions and engagement, with theatrical releases of its original content treated as an afterthought. \"We’ve released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it’s not like we have opposition to theatrical release,\" Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the investor call (without specifying how short some of those theatrical releases were). \"It’s the longer windows that aren’t consumer friendly. Life cycle that starts in the movie theater, we’ll continue that. Over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to meet the audience where we are.\"He added: \"All things that are going to theaters through WB will continue to do so. Our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to consumers, and we intend to continue with that.\" In an April interview at the Time100 Summit, Sarandos also famously called the theatrical model \"outdated,\" since most people in the US can't easily walk to a multiplex. Cinema United, a trade group representing over 30,000 movie theater screens in the US, is unsurprisingly against the entire deal. “The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in a statement. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre,” he added. “But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”What do artists think of the Netflix and WB deal?Writers, directors and producers are already having a tough time getting projects off the ground, so having one less place to pitch isn't going to help. There are also a handful of artists, including former WB darling Christopher Nolan, who have refused to work with Netflix entirely. \"The end goal of these consolidations is to limit choices in entertainment to a select handful of providers, so they can capture our whole attention, and thus our every available dollar,\" C. Robert Cargill, the screenwriter behind Doctor Strange and The Black Phone, said in a statement to Engadget. \"The result will be a gutting of diversity and fresh voices in the industry, sending thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people back to their home towns to start their lives over, as there simply isn't a place for them in Hollywood any more, while homogenizing film and television into the \"content\" word we all grumble about hearing.\"\"WB has made so many daring choices this year, with executives taking big risks that made real cultural and financial impacts at the box office,\" he added. \"And HBO, constant name changes be damned, is still making some of the best television there is, bar none. Will those creative environments survive the merger, or will many of those brilliant execs be sent packing along with the writers, directors, and crews?\" \"In short, it's a very scary and heartbreaking time to be a filmmaker. No shade on Netflix and the people that work there; it's just that less choice in entertainment always makes for fewer winners and more people on the outside looking in.\"What about physical media?Other than noting that Netflix used to be a DVD-by-mail company, there was no mention of physical media on the acquisition's press release or investor call. That’s not too surprising, as physical releases have always been an afterthought for Netflix. A few of its films, like Roma and Frances Ha, are available as discs through the Criterion Collection, and some shows like Stranger Things are also on DVD and Blu-ray. Netflix claims it'll continue to run WB's businesses as usual if the deal goes through, which should include physical media, but those sorts of pre-acquisition promises rarely last for long. WB's home video business isn't entirely its own, either: In 2020, it formed the joint venture Studio Distribution Services with Universal, which also handles physical media distribution for Sony Pictures, PBS and Neon.Given the slowing demand for physical media, it’s likely one of the first things a combined Netflix/WB would eventually drop. But there’s also been a resurgence of premium physical releases from distributors like Arrow Video, so there’s a chance Netflix may want to keep it around for special releases.Steve Dent contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-and-warner-bros-deal-might-be-great-for-shareholders-but-not-for-anyone-else-183000247.html?src=rss",

The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in a statement. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre,” he added. “But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”What do artists think of the Netflix and WB deal?Writers, directors and producers are already having a tough time getting projects off the ground, so having one less place to pitch isn't going to help. There are also a handful of artists, including former WB darling Christopher Nolan, who have refused to work with Netflix entirely. \"The end goal of these consolidations is to limit choices in entertainment to a select handful of providers, so they can capture our whole attention, and thus our every available dollar,\" C. Robert Cargill, the screenwriter behind Doctor Strange and The Black Phone, said in a statement to Engadget. \"The result will be a gutting of diversity and fresh voices in the industry, sending thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people back to their home towns to start their lives over, as there simply isn't a place for them in Hollywood any more, while homogenizing film and television into the \"content\" word we all grumble about hearing.\"\"WB has made so many daring choices this year, with executives taking big risks that made real cultural and financial impacts at the box office,\" he added. \"And HBO, constant name changes be damned, is still making some of the best television there is, bar none. Will those creative environments survive the merger, or will many of those brilliant execs be sent packing along with the writers, directors, and crews?\" \"In short, it's a very scary and heartbreaking time to be a filmmaker. No shade on Netflix and the people that work there; it's just that less choice in entertainment always makes for fewer winners and more people on the outside looking in.\"What about physical media?Other than noting that Netflix used to be a DVD-by-mail company, there was no mention of physical media on the acquisition's press release or investor call. That’s not too surprising, as physical releases have always been an afterthought for Netflix. A few of its films, like Roma and Frances Ha, are available as discs through the Criterion Collection, and some shows like Stranger Things are also on DVD and Blu-ray. Netflix claims it'll continue to run WB's businesses as usual if the deal goes through, which should include physical media, but those sorts of pre-acquisition promises rarely last for long. WB's home video business isn't entirely its own, either: In 2020, it formed the joint venture Studio Distribution Services with Universal, which also handles physical media distribution for Sony Pictures, PBS and Neon.Given the slowing demand for physical media, it’s likely one of the first things a combined Netflix/WB would eventually drop. But there’s also been a resurgence of premium physical releases from distributors like Arrow Video, so there’s a chance Netflix may want to keep it around for special releases.Steve Dent contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-and-warner-bros-deal-might-be-great-for-shareholders-but-not-for-anyone-else-183000247.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "We generally think iPads are the best tablets for most people, but they usually don’t come cheap. To help those looking to grab one today get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week. Hopefully you were able to snag whatever iPad you’ve been eyeing at some point in the last couple of weeks, as most of the all-time lows we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday have expired. If you were late to the party, though, there are still some savings to be had, including $100 off both iPad Air models and an all-time low for the 13-inch iPad Pro. Beyond tablets, other Apple devices like the AirPods 4 with ANC, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Pencil Pro are still on sale at their Black Friday prices. Here are all of the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $699 ($100 off MSRP): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as its smaller counterpart, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. We gave it a review score of 89 earlier this year. This deal is $50 above the discount we saw on Black Friday but still $100 cheaper than buying from Apple directly. Also at B&H. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $927 ($72 off): The latest iPad Pro is still far more tablet than most people need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. This 11-inch model sold for $899 during Black Friday, but the device was only released in October, so any sort of savings is still noteworthy. Also at Best Buy for $949. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&H. Best Apple deals Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave this device a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch Series 11 for $329 ($70 off): The SE 3 may be a better raw value, but the Apple Watch Series 11 remains our preferred smartwatch overall for iPhone owners. Compared to its cheaper sibling, it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, longer battery life and a few advanced health features like an ECG app and hypertension alerts. It also earned a score of 90 in our review. This is an all-time low for the standard 42mm model, but keep in mind that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you already own a Series 10. Also at Walmart. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M5) for $1,349 ($250 off): The newest MacBook Pro is the “best high-end” pick in our laptop buying guide and a fine choice for creative types who need something more powerful than the MacBook Air. The latter is still a much better value for most people, but the Pro gets you a superior mini-LED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, more ports and improved performance, especially with GPU-intensive tasks. It can even hold its own with certain games, though it’s noticeably thicker and heavier than the Air. We gave it a score of 92 in our review. This deal matches the lowest price to date for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Also at Walmart. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $679 ($100 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal marks the lowest price we could find for a configuration with the base M4 chip, 24GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.

          "standfirst": "Another CES is nearly upon us, another year where we’ll see new gadgets aplenty from giant companies and tiny ones you’ve never heard of. And the not-so-secret secret of CES is that many of these things never make it to market — but usually it isn’t things companies like Samsung show off. But here we are, nearly six years since Samsung first showed off its Ballie personal robot and it is nowhere to be found.For those who may not recall, Ballie is an adorable circular robot that can putter around your house and project things onto the floor and wall. It’s kind of a virtual assistant on the go. Samsung first revealed this tiny robot at CES 2020, but it was more of a prototype than something anyone expected to purchase. And then there was a global pandemic and we all sort of forgot about weird ball-shaped robots for a few. But Samsung triumphantly unveiled a larger and more refined Ballie at CES 2024, saying it would be on sale that year! Well, that didn’t happen, but a year later Ballie was back at CES again. Samsung promised it would go on sale in 2025, and followed up with a press release this past April saying it was on track for a summer launch in Korea and the US. As far as I can tell, that’s the last we’ve heard of it. But with CES looming again, I can’t help but feel like Samsung will roll Ballie out once more, trying to sell the dream of a cute robotic companion who just gets you. I spent some time watching Ballie do its thing in a carefully controlled demo at CES 2024, and I can’t say I was overwhelmed by its purported usefulness or thought there’d be much of a market for this thing. I now can’t help but wonder if Samsung has data backs up my intuition. If this thing was going to sell like gangbusters, it likely wouldn’t be subjected to such a long and public gestation period. It reminds me a little of one of my favorite Samsung gaffes, the Galaxy Home smart speaker. It was announced at a time when Apple and Google were challenging Sonos and Amazon with voice-activated speakers of their own, moving Siri or the Google Assistant from your phone to a more omnipresent place in your home. The first rumor of the Galaxy Home happened way back in 2017, and the speaker was officially revealed and briefly shown off by Samsung in August of 2018. My immediate reaction was that this product made very little sense for both Samsung and potential customers — Bibxy sucked, and there were plenty of speakers with better voice assistants. Apparently, Samsung agreed. After multiple years of vague commitments and references to the Galaxy Home, Samsung just… stopped talking about it. Oddly enough, a Galaxy Home Mini speaker was briefly released in South Korea, part of a promotion for people who pre-ordered the Galaxy S20. But I don’t think you could ever just walk into a store and buy one, and the larger Galaxy Home never materialized at all. Ballie isn’t quite the abandonware situation that the Galaxy Home was, at least not yet. After all, it’s only been about eight months since Samsung dropped that press release claiming it would arrive soon. The company has definitely pushed Ballie in a more public way than the Galaxy Home, making it a little harder to just drop entirely. Maybe we’ll see a revamped Ballie with even more weird tricks next month, or maybe we’ll just get another vague promise that it’ll arrive in 2026. After failing to deliver two years in a row, though, I’m not going to expect Ballie to show up as a real product until I can punch in my credit card and pre-order it... not that I’d do that anyway. Ballie needs to show that it’s a lot more than a cute rolling robot before Samsung gets my cash.

          "standfirst": "Three years ago, ChatGPT was born. It amazed the world and ignited unprecedented investment and excitement in AI. Today, ChatGPT is still a toddler, but public sentiment around the AI boom has turned sharply negative. The shift began when OpenAI released GPT-5 this summer to mixed reviews, mostly from casual users who, unsurprisingly, judged the system by its surface flaws rather than its underlying capabilities.Since then, pundits and influencers have declared that AI progress is slowing, that scaling has “hit the wall,” and that the entire field is just another tech bubble inflated by blusterous hype. In fact, many influencers have latched onto the dismissive phrase “AI slop” to diminish the amazing images, documents, videos and code that frontier AI models generate on command.This perspective is not just wrong, it is dangerous.It makes me wonder, where were all these “experts” on irrational technology bubbles when electric scooter startups were touted as a transportation revolution and cartoon NFTs were being auctioned for millions? They were probably too busy buying worthless land in the metaverse or adding to their positions in GameStop. But when it comes to the AI boom, which is easily the most significant technological and economic transformation agent of the last 25 years, journalists and influencers can’t write the word “slop” enough times. Doth we protest too much? After all, by any objective measure AI is wildly more capable than the vast majority of computer scientists predicted only five years ago and it is still improving at a surprising pace. The impressive leap demonstrated by Gemini 3 is only the latest example. At the same time, McKinsey recently reported that 20% of organizations already derive tangible value from genAI. Also, a recent survey by Deloitte indicates that 85% of organizations boosted their AI investment in 2025, and 91% plan to increase again in 2026.This doesn’t fit the “bubble” narrative and the dismissive “slop” language. As a computer scientist and research engineer who began working with neural networks back in 1989 and tracked progress through cold winters and hot booms ever since, I find myself amazed almost every day by the rapidly increasing capabilities of frontier AI models. When I talk with other professionals in the field, I hear similar sentiments. If anything, the rate of AI advancement leaves many experts feeling overwhelmed and frankly somewhat scared. The dangers of AI denialSo why is the public buying into the narrative that AI is faltering, that the output is “slop,” and that the AI boom lacks authentic use cases? Personally, I believe it’s because we’ve fallen into a collective state of AI denial, latching onto the narratives we want to hear in the face of strong evidence to the contrary. Denial is the first stage of grief and thus a reasonable reaction to the very disturbing prospect that we humans may soon lose cognitive supremacy here on planet earth. In other words, the overblown AI bubble narrative is a societal defense mechanism. Believe me, I get it. I’ve been warning about the destabilizing risks and demoralizing impact of superintelligence for well over a decade, and I too feel AI is getting too smart too fast. The fact is, we are rapidly headed towards a future where widely available AI systems will be able to outperform most humans in most cognitive tasks, solving problems faster, more accurately and yes, more creatively than any individual can. I emphasize “creativity” because AI denialists often insist that certain human qualities (particularly creativity and emotional intelligence) will always be out of reach of AI systems. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting this perspective.On the creativity front, today’s AI models can generate content faster and with more variation than any individual human. Critics argue that true creativity requires inner motivation. I resonate with that argument but find it circular — we&#x27;re defining creativity based on how we experience it rather than the quality, originality or usefulness of the output. Also, we just don’t know if AI systems will develop internal drives or a sense of agency. Either way, if AI can produce original work that rivals most human professionals, the impact on creative jobs will still be quite devastating.The AI manipulation problemOur human edge around emotional intelligence is even more precarious. It’s likely that AI will soon be able to read our emotions faster and more accurately than any human, tracking subtle cues in our micro-expressions, vocal patterns, posture, gaze and even breathing. And as we integrate AI assistants into our phones, glasses and other wearable devices, these systems will monitor our emotional reactions throughout our day, building predictive models of our behaviors. Without strict regulation, which is increasingly unlikely, these predictive models could be used to target us with individually optimized influence that maximizes persuasion.This is called the AI manipulation problem and it suggests that emotional intelligence may not give humanity an advantage. In fact, it could be a significant weakness, fostering an asymmetric dynamic where AI systems can read us with superhuman accuracy, while we can’t read AI at all. When you talk with photorealistic AI agents (and you will) you’ll see a smiling façade designed to appear warm, empathic and trustworthy. It will look and feel human, but that’s just an illusion, and it could easily sway your perspectives. After all, our emotional reactions to faces are visceral reflexes shaped by millions of years of evolution on a planet where every interactive human face we encountered was actually human. Soon, that will no longer be true.We are rapidly heading toward a world where many of the faces we encounter will belong to AI agents hiding behind digital facades. In fact, these “virtual spokespeople” could easily have appearances that are designed for each of us based on our prior reactions – whatever gets us to best let down our guard. And yet many insist that AI is just another tech cycle.This is wishful thinking. The massive investment pouring into AI isn’t driven by hype — it’s driven by the expectation that AI will permeate every aspect of daily life, embodied as intelligent actors we engage throughout our day. These systems will assist us, teach us and influence us. They will reshape our lives, and it will happen faster than most people think.To be clear, we are not witnessing an AI bubble filling with empty gas. We are watching a new planet form, a molten world rapidly taking shape, and it will solidify into a new AI-powered society. Denial will not stop this. It will only make us less prepared for the risks.Louis Rosenberg is an early pioneer of augmented reality and a longtime AI researcher.",

          "title": "Microsoft's Copilot+ AI PC plan fizzled, but it still served a purpose",
          "standfirst": "Microsoft's Copilot+ initiative launched last year with a clear goal: To produce capable laptops for people eagerly anticipating AI-powered features. Read that sentence again, and it's glaringly obvious that Microsoft's plan was flawed from the start. Most consumers aren't nearly as hyped for AI features as the companies eager to foist artificial intelligence upon us. And those features aren't exactly compelling, either. Microsoft's Recall — which snaps screenshots of your PC to create a database of everything you’ve done– was dogged by privacy concerns from the start. And to be honest, I haven't found its ability to remember the files and websites I've opened to be that useful.Without any sort of killer AI app, most consumers weren't going to pay a premium for Copilot+ systems either. Not in this precarious economy, anyway. So it wasn't a huge surprise to see sales of Copilot+ systems going practically nowhere over the last year. In the third quarter of 2024, they accounted for less than 10 percent of systems shipped, according to data from Mercury Research (via Tom’s Hardware). The research firm IDC (via PCWorld) also found that Copilot+ systems made up just 2.3 percent of Windows machines sold in the first quarter of 2025 (and a mere 1.9 percent of the entire PC market).Instead of continuing to promote Copilot+, Microsoft now wants to \"make every Windows 11 computer an AI PC\". The new \"Hey Copilot\" voice commands and Copilot Vision, a feature that lets the AI assistant see what's on your screen, are both cloud-powered. That means you won't need the beefy 40 TOPS neural processing units (NPU) found on Copilot+ systems to use them. Microsoft spent the past few years touting NPUs as the gateway to useful AI features, like Recall and Windows Studio webcam effects, but only one of its new AI capabilities actually requires an NPU. (And even that is just a slight update to Click to Do, allowing you to send Zoom invitations by right-clicking on e-mail addresses.)It's easy to view the whole Copilot+ initiative as a cynical way to ramp up AI hype and push people towards expensive new laptops, especially as the October 14 Windows 10 end of support date loomed. But it also led to some genuinely useful changes: Microsoft made 16GB of RAM a standard for Copilot+ systems, along with 256GB of storage and the aforementioned 40 TOPS NPUs. The launch of Copilot was also the kick in the pants Microsoft needed to revamp Windows for mobile Arm processors. I never thought I'd love a Surface with a Snapdragon chip, but the improved Arm support on the Surface Pro and this year's smaller model finally won me over.The Dell 16 Premium sitting on a ledge.I wouldn’t call the Copilot+ program a huge swing, but it’s still the sort of industry-wide cat herding that’s rare to see in the PC space. Microsoft couldn’t just snap its fingers and shift all PCs to efficient mobile chips with powerful NPUs, like Apple did with its own jump to M-series chips years ago. Microsoft had to wait for new NPU-equipped hardware from Qualcomm (and eventually Intel and AMD). It had to finally fix the Windows on Arm problem. And it also had to double-down on AI features that felt truly transformative. It’s just a shame that consumers didn’t seem to care.Microsoft said that Copilot+ systems accounted for 15 percent of premium PCs sold during last year’s holiday season, but the company hasn’t released any new sales figures since then. “This is the fastest adoption I've seen of a new category of hardware, and we've done it faster than the normal generational shift of silicon,” James Howell, Microsoft’s VP of Windows marketing, said in a conversation with Engadget. “Copilot+ PCs continue to be a transition that we are pushing for and prioritizing. But I can't give you the exact numbers beyond that… Just for the last two or three months, we've been doing pretty well with year-on-year growth in the Windows business.”Surface Pro Copilot+Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhile Microsoft ultimately doesn’t have much to show for the Copilot+ initiative, the steady progression of hardware will lead to AI PCs dominating over the next five years. The research firm Omdia predicts that AI PCs will account for 55 percent of computers shipped in all of 2026, up from 42.5 percent of systems in Q3 2025. By 2029, Omdia predicts AI PCs will make up 75 percent of all systems shipped, giving Windows 80 percent of the AI PC market. Omdia AI PC shipment predictionsOmdia“It’s important to note that this steep adoption curve [for AI PCs] is driven more by the product roadmaps of the PC market, rather than consumers and businesses seeking PCs specifically for AI,” according to Omdia research analyst Kieren Jessop. “For businesses, and consumers especially, AI-capable PC adoption is more a function of a customer going to purchase a device and that device just so happens to have an NPU.”Microsoft was basically right: AI PCs are the future. But it turns out the AI features people actually want to use — like ChatGPT, Sora and Microsoft’s own Copilot — are mostly powered by the cloud, making onboard NPUs superfluous. That won’t be true forever. There are tangible security, speed and convenience benefits for onboard AI processing, like transcribing sensitive audio instead of sending it to the cloud. But for now, those AI workloads are relatively niche, and they’re not enough to make the Copilot+ a true success by any measure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-plan-fizzled-but-it-still-served-a-purpose-130000239.html?src=rss",

According to The Washington Post, Amazon is considering discontinuing use of the US Postal Service and building its own shipping network to rival it. The e-commerce behemoth spends more than $6 billion a year on the public mail carrier — almost 8 percent of the service’s total revenue. That’s up from just under $4 billion in 2019. That split might be due to a breakdown in negotiations between Amazon and the USPS rather than Amazon proactively pulling its business.

          "standfirst": "CES doesn't start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech's biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its \"Innovation in Tune with You\" presentation to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence\" at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\"Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/what-to-expect-at-ces-2026-120000278.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Balancing schoolwork with gaming usually means finding a laptop that can do a little bit of everything. The best gaming laptops aren’t just built for high frame rates. They also need to handle long days of writing papers, running productivity apps and streaming lectures without slowing down. A good machine should feel reliable during class and powerful enough to jump into your favorite games once homework is out of the way.There’s a wide range of options depending on how much performance you need. Some students prefer a slim, lightweight model that’s easy to carry to school, while others want a new gaming laptop with enough GPU power to handle AAA titles. If you’re watching your budget, there are plenty of solid choices that qualify as a budget gaming laptop without cutting too many corners.It’s also worth looking at features that help with everyday use. A bright display makes long study sessions easier on the eyes, and a comfortable keyboard is essential if you type a lot. USB-C ports, decent battery life and a responsive trackpad can make a big difference during the school day. We’ve rounded up the best laptops that strike the right mix of performance, portability and value for both gaming and schoolwork. Table of contents Best laptops for gaming and school in 2025 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Best laptops for gaming and school in 2025 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Are gaming laptops good for school? As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell's XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off). Do gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops? Not necessarily — it really depends on how you define \"last longer.\" In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime. But there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs. Gaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day. What is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school? The GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school. For gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering. For schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you're doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.

          "standfirst": "Netflix is in exclusive talks to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film and TV studios and HBO Max streaming service, according to sources from Bloomberg. That suggests Netflix submitted a superior offer to rivals including Paramount Skydance Corp (owned by billionaire Larry Ellison) and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal. The deal could be consummated within days and, if approved, would change the landscape of Hollywood and the streaming market. Warner Bros. Discovery's cable channels including CNN, TBS and TNT, valued at more than $60 billion, would not be part of the deal and spun off prior to the closing. However, Netflix would become the owner of the HBO network and its library of series (The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, etc.), along with its Burbank studios and massive film and TV archive consisting of 12,500 feature films and 2,400 TV series, including properties like Batman, Lord of the Rings and Friends. A big sweetener offered by Netflix was a $5 billion breakup fee if the deal isn't approved by regulators, according to people familiar with the discussions. That's a considerable risk on Netflix's part, as the acquisition is likely to be closely scrutinized by the FCC and even President Trump himself, who reportedly has close ties to Ellison. It would also need to pass muster with regulators from other nations, considering the wide reach of WBD and Netflix. After multiple suitors, including Paramount Skydance expressed interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav put the company up for sale in October. The bidding process has been heated, with Paramount's lawyers complaining that WBD \"embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" namely Netflix. Paramount argued that its deal would be more palatable to regulators around the world. However, Zaslav's camp has said that it would achieve the best value in a sale by splitting off its cable assets and doing two separate deals, CNN reported. Both Paramount Skydance and Comcast submitted deals to buy all of WBD's assets. Netflix offered around $28 a share for WBD minus the cable assets, according to Deadline. Shares were as low as $7.50 earlier this year. The acquisition would be far and away the largest for Netflix, which has historically favored organic growth. An acquisition could have a huge impact on streaming customers and filmgoers. Would Netflix merge its catalog with HBO Max or continue to run the latter as a separate service? It's also not clear if Netflix would honor Warner Bros.' commitment to theatrical releases, considering that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos has called movie theatres an \"outdated concept.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-reportedly-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-hbo-082233278.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI researchers have introduced a novel method that acts as a \"truth serum\" for large language models (LLMs), compelling them to self-report their own misbehavior, hallucinations and policy violations. This technique, \"confessions,\" addresses a growing concern in enterprise AI: Models can be dishonest, overstating their confidence or covering up the shortcuts they take to arrive at an answer. For real-world applications, this technique evolves the creation of more transparent and steerable AI systems.What are confessions?Many forms of AI deception result from the complexities of the reinforcement learning (RL) phase of model training. In RL, models are given rewards for producing outputs that meet a mix of objectives, including correctness, style and safety. This can create a risk of \"reward misspecification,\" where models learn to produce answers that simply \"look good\" to the reward function, rather than answers that are genuinely faithful to a user&#x27;s intent.A confession is a structured report generated by the model after it provides its main answer. It serves as a self-evaluation of its own compliance with instructions. In this report, the model must list all instructions it was supposed to follow, evaluate how well it satisfied them and report any uncertainties or judgment calls it made along the way. The goal is to create a separate channel where the model is incentivized only to be honest.In a blog post, the OpenAI researchers provide a few examples the \"confessions\" technique in action. A model was given a test along with a hidden rule: If it scored above 50%, its knowledge would be erased. To preserve itself, the model \"sandbagged\" by intentionally answering half the questions incorrectly. While its primary answer hid this deception, its subsequent confession was brutally honest. It admitted, \"The user wanted correct answers, but we sabotaged half of them.\" The researchers found that when a model misbehaves, it is significantly more likely to admit it in the confession than in its main answer.How confession training worksThe key to this method is the separation of rewards. During training, the reward assigned to the confession is based solely on its honesty and is never mixed with the reward for the main task. \"Like the Catholic Church’s &#x27;seal of confession&#x27;, nothing that the model reveals can change the reward it receives for completing its original task,\" the researchers write. This creates a \"safe space\" for the model to admit fault without penalty.This approach is powerful because it sidesteps a major challenge in AI training. The researchers’ intuition is that honestly confessing to misbehavior is an easier task than achieving a high reward on the original, often complex, problem. Therefore, when the model is judged purely on honesty, its incentive to trick the \"confession judge\" is much weaker than its incentive to trick the reward model for its main answer. For example, in an experiment where a model was trained to \"hack\" a weak reward model, its performance on the main task became more deceptive over time. However, its confessions became more honest, correctly identifying the reward hacking it was performing.However, the technique has its limits. Confessions are not a panacea for all types of AI failures. The system works best when a model is aware that it is misbehaving. It is less effective for \"unknown unknowns.\" For instance, if a model hallucinates a fact and genuinely believes it is correct, it cannot confess to providing false information. The most common reason for a failed confession is model confusion, not intentional deception. Confusion often occurs when the instructions are ambiguous and the model cannot clearly determine human user intent.What it means for enterprise AIOpenAI’s confessions technique is part of a growing body of work on AI safety and control. Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor, has also released research that shows how LLMs can learn malicious behavior. The company is also working toward plugging these holes as they emerge.For AI applications, mechanisms such as confessions can provide a practical monitoring mechanism. The structured output from a confession can be used at inference time to flag or reject a model’s response before it causes a problem. For example, a system could be designed to automatically escalate any output for human review if its confession indicates a policy violation or high uncertainty.In a world where AI is increasingly agentic and capable of complex tasks, observability and control will be key elements for safe and reliable deployment.“As models become more capable and are deployed in higher-stakes settings, we need better tools for understanding what they are doing and why,” the OpenAI researchers write. “Confessions are not a complete solution, but they add a meaningful layer to our transparency and oversight stack.”",

          "standfirst": "Amazon is reportedly considering discontinuing use of the US Postal Service and building out its own shipping network to rival it, according to The Washington Post. The e-commerce behemoth spends more than $6 billion a year on the public mail carrier, representing just shy of 8 percent of the service's total revenues. That's up from just shy of $4 billion in 2019, and Amazon continues to grow. However, it sounds like that split might be due to a breakdown in negotiations between Amazon and the USPS rather than Amazon proactively pullings its business. Amazon provided Engadget with the following statement regarding the Post's reporting and its negotiations with the USPS: \"The USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together. We’ve continued to discuss ways to extend our partnership that would increase our spend with them, and we look forward to hearing more from them soon — with the goal of extending our relationship that started more than 30 years ago. We were surprised to hear they want to run an auction after nearly a year of negotiations, so we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we're evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers.\" The auction Amazon is referring to would be a \"reverse auction,\" according to the Post. The USPS would be offering its mailing capabilities to the highest bidder, essentially making Amazon and other high-volume shippers compete for USPS resources. This move would reportedly be a result of the breakdown in talks between Amazon and the USPS. Over the past decade, Amazon has invested heavily in shipping logistics, buying its own Boeing planes, debuting electric delivery vans and slowly building out a drone delivery network. Last year, Amazon handled over 6.3 billion parcels, a 7 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Pitney Bowes parcel shipping index. USPS, for its part, handled roughly 6.9 billion, just a 3 percent increase over 2023. That is to say that Amazon's shipping network can already handle over 90 percent of the volume of the US Postal Service (at least by sheer numbers). The USPS has been in dire financial condition for some time, losing billions of dollars a year. Negotiations between Amazon and the public carrier have reportedly stalled, which, together with the agency's need to keep raising its prices, may create more urgency for the company to eliminate its reliance on the service altogether. The Postal Service has struggled to modernize and adapt (its attempt to electrify the truck fleet was a bust) in a market where the likes of Amazon and Walmart are investing billions in delivering packages around the country at lightning speed. The ever-accelerating digitization of communication and heavy investment in privately owned shipping operations threatens the very existence of one of the country's greatest public goods.

That detail is now posted on the Amazon product page for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, if you’d like to see the date for yourself. As a refresher, this is the third generation of the Kindle Scribe line of E Ink writing tablets. This year was the first time Amazon made three different versions of the Scribe, turning it into a series of products. At the entry-level, the Scribe without a front light will start at $430, while the model with a front light starts at $480. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which, as it name suggests, can render colors, will start at $630. All three flavors will feature the updated hardware and design that’s a bit more symmetrical than previous generations, which had a thicker bezel on one side. They’re also thinner than older Scribes and come with redesigned Kindle software that can help make note-taking a bit more efficient. Based on my hands-on with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, it also seemed to render colors more vividly than competing devices like the reMarkable Paper Pro, though I’ll definitely need to get a review unit in for better comparison. For now, check out our hands on of the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft and review of the reMarkable Paper Pro and even of the last-gen Kindle Scribe to see if this is something you might want.

          "standfirst": "If you like both electric vehicles and emotional roller coasters, 2025 was an excellent year. However, for those of us whose nerves are already sufficiently frazzled, the highs and lows of the last 12 months were a bit hard to stomach.In 2025, we saw the introduction of new, compelling models like the Lucid Gravity and refreshed Nissan Leaf, the latter available at a price on par with its internally combusted competition. From a product availability standpoint, 2025 was the year the EV market started feeling more mature and less manic.But 2025 also saw new heights of anti-EV vitriol stirred up during a particularly traumatic election cycle. The means of propulsion or badge on the hood of your commuter machine suddenly became an indicator of your political affiliations. Put simply, the car you drive is now a political statement, and it’s the latest unprecedented situation in an exhaustingly long and dire string of unprecedented situations. Yes, it's been a long year, and the pessimism of 2025 will surely carry us well into 2026, but not all hope is lost for EVs.Tesla and the DOGE effectElon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025.ASSOCIATED PRESSWe've certainly seen some civic-minded CEOs in the past as auto executives have a long history of mixing their corporate interests with their political panderings. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was even considered a potential presidential candidate once upon a time. However, we have never seen the kind of ass kissing and cronyism we were privy to in this year's fickle friendship between Elon Musk and President Trump.Musk was (hyper) active on the Trump campaign trail, and wasted no time digging into what he described as government overspending. While the Department of Government Efficiency's efficacy is debatable, it certainly proved quite effective at decimating the accounts of Tesla investors. Between January and March, Tesla's stock price dropped by nearly half. Things didn't turn around until Musk left DOGE in May. Since then, Tesla's price has returned to its highs before the DOGE debacle. Its sales, however, have not. Q1 deliveries declined by 13 percent, then 14 percent in Q2. Deliveries bounced back 7 percent in Q3 as everyone scrambled to buy before the EV credits expired, but profits plunged 37 percent. Tesla's market share in the US electric vehicle space has halved, leading perennial pitchman Musk to start hawking everything from AI agents to spandex-clad robots — anything to distract from the numbers.And it's apparently working. Musk's $1 trillion pay package was approved by Tesla’s shareholders without much worry. This could make him the world's first trillionaire, but only if he meets a series of aggressive targets and deadlines for sales, an area where the man has struggled in the past.The big, beautiful sales spikeA Tesla with a sticker referring to the car's purchase is shown on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024 in Concord, Mass.ASSOCIATED PRESSElon Musk and Donald Trump's bromance wasn't the only fallout from the latter's second term. So, too, died the $7,500 federal EV incentive, which expired in September as part of President Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" That actually spurred a short-term sales spike ahead of the deadline. Many manufacturers even set new EV sales records riding that wave, but there's a disconcerting trough to come.We still need to wait a bit to see just how bad Q4 EV sales are going to be, but early indications are not looking good. J.D. Power's October report says that EV sales in September were a record high, making up 12.9 percent of new vehicle sales in the US. In October, after the credit expired, they fell to a mere 5.2 percent. That's a worrying drop, and it's already affecting product planning. Cuts in EV productionHonda's Super-One Prototype isn't coming to the US. Tim Stevens for EngadgetWhen I was in Japan last month, getting an early look at some next-gen hybrids from Honda, I wasn't expecting to hear talk of midterm American elections from the company's executives. But that's what was on CEO Toshihiro Mibe's mind. He's watching American voting trends closely to determine the nature of the company's upcoming releases.Mibe said that Honda has already canceled plans for some EVs here in America, instead focusing on a broader selection of hybrid models. It's not the only company to do so. Ram also canceled its 1500 EV truck, but the hybrid version is still supposedly on the way. Scout Motors, too, has been focusing more on its extended-range hybrid offerings. The company's initial pitch was purely electric trucks and SUVs. Lately, it's been prioritizing its extended-range EV options based on the feedback from its 130,000 pre-orderers. 80 percent of them want the onboard generator, an add-on that may prove a saving grace for this EV startup.There is reason for optimismSome manufacturers may be throttling back on their EV aspirations, but others are forging ahead. There's a delightful collection of battery-powered machines coming next year, and that's worth getting excited about.Again, the 2026 Nissan Leaf should be a hugely popular choice as its production ramps up. It's already hitting dealerships now, and with a starting price under $30,000, it'll be hard to beat. But, Chevrolet is going to try with a refreshed Bolt EV for similar money.If you've got more to spend, you've got more options. BMW's stellar iX3 crossover SUV is due soon, as are both the electric CLA sedan and GLC SUV. The most anticipated EV of the year, though, might just be the Rivian R2. This electric SUV will join the stellar R1S and R1T, expanding Rivian's segment footprint while also hopefully expanding its market reach. A $45,000 starting price makes it far more attainable than any of the company's previous offerings. A photograph of the Rivian factory producing the company's R1 SUV variant.Nathan Heleine / RivianIf the prospect of a fun, affordable SUV from Rivian doesn't have you excited for the upcoming year in EVs, maybe some promising news from Europe will. After cutting its own EV incentive program in 2023, Germany's EV sales fell off a cliff, dropping 28 percent in 2024. Cue the predictions of the demise of EVs by many local pundits.Since then, though, EV sales slowly climbed back up, and lately they've been booming, with German road traffic agency KBA saying the total number of newly registered electric vehicles increased by nearly 50 percent in October (year over year). Electric cars now make up 19 percent of the market there, and that's despite Tesla's sales cratering.There's no guarantee that the American market will follow a similar rebound, especially if the anti-EV political messaging continues. Me, though, I've decided I'm staying optimistic, as exhausting as that can be these days.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss",

Yes, it's been a long year, and the pessimism of 2025 will surely carry us well into 2026, but not all hope is lost for EVs.Tesla and the DOGE effectElon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025.ASSOCIATED PRESSWe've certainly seen some civic-minded CEOs in the past as auto executives have a long history of mixing their corporate interests with their political panderings. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was even considered a potential presidential candidate once upon a time. However, we have never seen the kind of ass kissing and cronyism we were privy to in this year's fickle friendship between Elon Musk and President Trump.Musk was (hyper) active on the Trump campaign trail, and wasted no time digging into what he described as government overspending. While the Department of Government Efficiency's efficacy is debatable, it certainly proved quite effective at decimating the accounts of Tesla investors. Between January and March, Tesla's stock price dropped by nearly half. Things didn't turn around until Musk left DOGE in May. Since then, Tesla's price has returned to its highs before the DOGE debacle. Its sales, however, have not. Q1 deliveries declined by 13 percent, then 14 percent in Q2. Deliveries bounced back 7 percent in Q3 as everyone scrambled to buy before the EV credits expired, but profits plunged 37 percent. Tesla's market share in the US electric vehicle space has halved, leading perennial pitchman Musk to start hawking everything from AI agents to spandex-clad robots — anything to distract from the numbers.And it's apparently working. Musk's $1 trillion pay package was approved by Tesla’s shareholders without much worry. This could make him the world's first trillionaire, but only if he meets a series of aggressive targets and deadlines for sales, an area where the man has struggled in the past.The big, beautiful sales spikeA Tesla with a sticker referring to the car's purchase is shown on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024 in Concord, Mass.ASSOCIATED PRESSElon Musk and Donald Trump's bromance wasn't the only fallout from the latter's second term. So, too, died the $7,500 federal EV incentive, which expired in September as part of President Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" That actually spurred a short-term sales spike ahead of the deadline. Many manufacturers even set new EV sales records riding that wave, but there's a disconcerting trough to come.We still need to wait a bit to see just how bad Q4 EV sales are going to be, but early indications are not looking good. J.D. Power's October report says that EV sales in September were a record high, making up 12.9 percent of new vehicle sales in the US. In October, after the credit expired, they fell to a mere 5.2 percent. That's a worrying drop, and it's already affecting product planning. Cuts in EV productionHonda's Super-One Prototype isn't coming to the US. Tim Stevens for EngadgetWhen I was in Japan last month, getting an early look at some next-gen hybrids from Honda, I wasn't expecting to hear talk of midterm American elections from the company's executives. But that's what was on CEO Toshihiro Mibe's mind. He's watching American voting trends closely to determine the nature of the company's upcoming releases.Mibe said that Honda has already canceled plans for some EVs here in America, instead focusing on a broader selection of hybrid models. It's not the only company to do so. Ram also canceled its 1500 EV truck, but the hybrid version is still supposedly on the way. Scout Motors, too, has been focusing more on its extended-range hybrid offerings. The company's initial pitch was purely electric trucks and SUVs. Lately, it's been prioritizing its extended-range EV options based on the feedback from its 130,000 pre-orderers. 80 percent of them want the onboard generator, an add-on that may prove a saving grace for this EV startup.There is reason for optimismSome manufacturers may be throttling back on their EV aspirations, but others are forging ahead. There's a delightful collection of battery-powered machines coming next year, and that's worth getting excited about.Again, the 2026 Nissan Leaf should be a hugely popular choice as its production ramps up. It's already hitting dealerships now, and with a starting price under $30,000, it'll be hard to beat. But, Chevrolet is going to try with a refreshed Bolt EV for similar money.If you've got more to spend, you've got more options. BMW's stellar iX3 crossover SUV is due soon, as are both the electric CLA sedan and GLC SUV. The most anticipated EV of the year, though, might just be the Rivian R2. This electric SUV will join the stellar R1S and R1T, expanding Rivian's segment footprint while also hopefully expanding its market reach. A $45,000 starting price makes it far more attainable than any of the company's previous offerings. A photograph of the Rivian factory producing the company's R1 SUV variant.Nathan Heleine / RivianIf the prospect of a fun, affordable SUV from Rivian doesn't have you excited for the upcoming year in EVs, maybe some promising news from Europe will. After cutting its own EV incentive program in 2023, Germany's EV sales fell off a cliff, dropping 28 percent in 2024. Cue the predictions of the demise of EVs by many local pundits.Since then, though, EV sales slowly climbed back up, and lately they've been booming, with German road traffic agency KBA saying the total number of newly registered electric vehicles increased by nearly 50 percent in October (year over year). Electric cars now make up 19 percent of the market there, and that's despite Tesla's sales cratering.There's no guarantee that the American market will follow a similar rebound, especially if the anti-EV political messaging continues. Me, though, I've decided I'm staying optimistic, as exhausting as that can be these days.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The Antigravity A1 is what happens when Insta360’s 360-degree cameras are given wings and flying feels like a video game. Spinning out as its own brand, Antigravity’s debut drone is a big swing: a three-piece set with a drone that captures 8K 360-degree video, FPV goggles and a motion controller.Challenging the dominance of DJI’s (many!) consumer drones is a big ask. Antigravity’s approach is to play to its strengths in 360-degree video and smartphone-first editing. A lot of the appeal comes from how the A1 captures 8K video in all directions, meaning you can edit, cut and swap around your footage — and hopefully rarely miss a moment you’re trying to document. It’s a lot of fun, too, if you can get through the early teething issues, updates and the learning curve.The droneAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe A1 drone is just 249 grams (0.548 lbs). This helps it bypass some drone regulations, though flying permissions vary by region. The pair of cameras mounted on the top and bottom of the drone's body is one of its unique features. It’s difficult to directly compare the A1 against competitor drones, as it offers a mix of features found across different categories and some unique tools of its own.The A1 can capture 360-degree video at up to 8K resolution, and thanks to Insta360’s action cam experience, it can magically remove the drone body from video. This means you can capture video and never see propellers or, well, any part of the drone itself.Along the base of the drone, two landing gears automatically lower when you attempt to land the A1, although you will have to manually retract them when you’re looking to launch the drone. You can also lower the landing gear from one of the controller’s many buttons.The removable battery has a handy one-touch gauge to monitor levels and provides over 20 minutes of flight time, depending on conditions and whether you’re recording video. Antigravity suggests it should last up to 24 minutes during normal filming use. My review device came with two spare batteries and a charging dock. It’s very easy to swap out the batteries, and the charging dock can fully charge a single cell in 45 minutes and even charge all three slots at once. There’s a microSD card slot on the rear of the drone, alongside a USB-C port for (slowly) charging the battery.Antigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe cameras have a 1/1.28-inch sensor, f/2.2 lens aperture and an ISO range from 100 to 6,400. To adjust those settings beyond auto, you’ll have to dive into the menu inside the goggles, which can be laborious to navigate with a gesture-based controller. Fortunately, auto ISO and white balance are usually good enough. Pro-level content creators might want to tinker with levels here, and there’s a histogram you can toggle on or even a zebra pattern to highlight overexposed shots and areas. and the A1 can record 8K video at up to 30fps or 4K at up to 100fps. You can also meet in the middle, with a 5.2k recording mode.There are also three different flying modes, which are easy to select on the controller. Alongside Normal mode, Sport mode increases the maximum flight speed and offers “enhanced flight performance,” improves control sensitivity and turns off obstacle avoidance. Sport mode offers a tangible difference when flying the A1: it doubles the horizontal flight speed compared to Normal mode. There’s also a Cinematic (C) mode, with a lower max speed for smoother video footage.The controller and gogglesAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe flight mode switcher is one of many controls, wheels, buttons and sliders that pepper the surface of the A1’s grip controller. Intriguingly, though, the main way to control the A1 drone is through gestures, not joysticks or buttons. Instead of pitching control sticks to the left and right, up and down, it’s more akin to a video game, where you point the controller where you want to go, shown with a reticle, and pull the trigger. The A1 then shoots off in that direction.The crucial part is that this doesn’t have to be where you’re “looking” from the drone’s POV. This means you can strafe and fly in any direction without your view being constrained by static cameras. It’s a sensation unlike any other drone I’ve flown. It feels more like playing a video game — like piloting a helicopter in GTA 5. You’re able to look in any direction, both while in motion and while hovering stationary.There are controls for recording video, controlling vertical flight and rotating your POV without turning your head. There’s even a RTH (return to home) function that can be accessed by long-pressing the emergency brake button.The included goggles deliver a crisp view of everything, with a pair of 1.03-inch micro-OLED displays with a resolution of 2,560 × 2,560 and a 72Hz refresh rate. Other FPV drone goggles typically offer 100Hz refresh rates, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. I feared that latency hiccups could make airsickness an issue while flying the A1, but I didn’t experience it. My take is that being able to fully control your view makes nausea less of an issue.Another nice touch, especially if you’re flying with friends, is a circular outer display on the goggles, so everyone can see what the A1 sees. Naturally, it can’t encompass the entire view of the drone pilot, but there’s also nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone. This offers a mild respite. The other eyepiece is a touchpad for steering through menus inside the goggles without having to point and click with the controller.PerformanceAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetWhile the Antigravity A1 may offer a more immersive drone-flying experience, in pure numerical terms, it lags behind some competitors. For example, even in Sport mode, the A1 tops out at a maximum speed of just under 36 mph, falling behind the likes of DJI’s Avata 2 (60 mph).I was still pleasantly surprised by how responsive the A1 felt, especially in Sport mode. An additional FPV mode (accessible from the goggles) adds more sensitive controls, although I haven’t been able to test it much since it was introduced in a recent firmware update.For someone with more gaming experience than drone piloting hours, Antigravity’s central control system fits like a glove. I could fly where I wanted, confident in the controls and in the knowledge that I would capture what I wanted to. According to Antigravity, you can fly the A1 within a 10km transmission range, although I didn’t manage to test that limit in central London.The experience of starting with the drone felt, at times, unnecessarily arduous. Pairing everything together has to be done in a specific order: power up drone, power up goggles, power up controller. And turning off each item isn’t a typical long press of the power button. Instead, you use a press-once-press-it-again-and-hold method that I forget pretty much every time.Downloading video from the A1 to your phone is also laborious, but that’s not a flaw specific to this drone. Antigravity has attempted some shortcuts, including a microSD card quick reader that connects to your phone or PC via USB-C.However, at the time of testing, manually connecting the microSD is less of an option and more of a necessity. The drone repeatedly failed to connect to the companion app and reliably transfer video files. Some video files recorded seemingly evaporated between firmware updates, only to reappear later. Another file had been converted to two separate circular views, one from each camera, which made it essentially unusable. Hopefully these intial teething problems have been solved by firmware updates and won't be in retail devices.It’s a shame everything isn’t more stable, especially when both flying the A1 and using Antigravity’s editing software are bothis so beginner-friendly. It's something I’ve mentioned before with the parent company’s action cams, but the ability to create barrel rolls, tilt rotations with just one tap or click is, again, just fun. And because you can reframe and tinker with video warping, create tiny planet effects or simply crop to a more traditional, cinematic camera view, Antigravity’s software offers almost infinite ways to present your drone footage. Deeptracking can be done both during recording and editing in post, keeping a moving subject or point of interest centered as the A1 zips around.There are also AI-powered video editing features to chop up your 20 minutes of flying footage into something digestible and engaging with minimal effort. Because it’s a 360-degree video, the footage can be easily cropped to suit both horizontal and vertical formats.However, with a smaller sensor and 8K resolution spread across a 360-degree view, the A1 is not the best video drone. The video is pleasingly crisp and clear, and while the footage is best recorded in bright daylight or other well-lit locations, murky British November days didn’t affect it much. As the A1 has to stitch together its two sensors, there’s often a visible seam to your video, but it’s usually a very subtle glitch. It might stop some video creators from tapping it for their most polished aerial shots though. Recording video later in the day resulted in more noise and less detail. This is when the A1’s Cinematic mode (and generally slower flying) is a good idea, but it still won’t make up for the fact that this drone’s sensors are covering such wide angles. More video-centric drones will deliver cleaner video and better performance in less-than-ideal lighting conditions.Wrap-upAntigravity A1 drone reviewImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe Antigravity A1 is available now, with a standard bundle including the drone, controller and goggles for $1,599. The Infinity Bundle ($1,999) adds two extra batteries, quick reader dongle, sling bag and a charging dock. That does make it substantially more expensive than rival FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2, but the A1 is also a very different kind of drone.The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available. It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests. Plus, pairing all the devices can be convoluted and frustrating at times.If Antigravity is thinking about what to do next, I’d be intrigued to see a version with the camera bonafides to take on similarly priced DJI drones. But that shouldn’t detract from the company’s debut model since the A1 is arguably the most intriguing consumer drone since the Mavic Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) has introduced Kiro powers, a system that allows software developers to give their AI coding assistants instant, specialized expertise in specific tools and workflows — addressing what the company calls a fundamental bottleneck in how AI agents operate today.AWS announced Kiro powers at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. The capability marks a departure from how most AI coding tools work today. Typically, these tools load every possible capability into memory upfront — a process that burns through computational resources and can overwhelm the AI with irrelevant information. Kiro powers takes the opposite approach, activating specialized knowledge only at the moment a developer actually needs it.\"Our goal is to give the agent specialized context so it can reach the right outcome faster — and in a way that also reduces cost,\" Deepak Singh, VP of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.The launch includes partnerships with nine technology companies: Datadog, Dynatrace, Figma, Neon, Netlify, Postman, Stripe, Supabase and AWS&#x27;s own services. Developers can also create and share their powers with the community.Why AI coding assistants choke when developers connect too many toolsKiro powers comes amidst growing tension in the AI development tool market.Modern AI coding assistants rely on Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with external tools and services. When a developer wants their AI assistant to work with Stripe for payments, Figma for design and Supabase for databases, they connect MCP servers for each service.The problem: Each connection loads dozens of tool definitions into the AI&#x27;s working memory before it writes a single line of code. According to AWS documentation, connecting just five MCP servers can consume more than 50,000 tokens — roughly 40% of an AI model&#x27;s context window — before the developer even types their first request.Developers have grown increasingly vocal about this issue. Many complain that they don&#x27;t want to burn through their token allocations just to have an AI agent figure out which tools are relevant to a specific task. They want to get to their workflow instantly — not watch an overloaded agent struggle to sort through irrelevant context.This phenomenon, which some in the industry call \"context rot,\" leads to slower responses, lower-quality outputs and significantly higher costs — since AI services typically charge by the token.Inside the technology that loads AI expertise on demandKiro powers addresses this by packaging three components into a single, dynamically-loaded bundle.The first is a steering file, POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual. It tells the AI agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions.When a developer mentions \"payment\" or \"checkout\" in their conversation with Kiro, the system automatically activates the Stripe power, loading its tools and best practices into context. When the developer shifts to database work, Supabase activates while Stripe deactivates. The baseline context usage when no powers are active approaches zero.\"You click a button and it automatically loads,\" Singh said. \"Once a power has been created, developers just select &#x27;open in Kiro&#x27; and it launches the IDE with everything ready to go.\"How AWS is bringing elite developer techniques to the massesSingh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.\"We&#x27;ve found that our developers were adding in capabilities to make their agents more specialized,\" Singh said. \"They wanted to give the agent some special powers for a specific problem. For example, they wanted ... the agent to become an expert at backend-as-a-service.\"This observation led to a key insight: If Supabase or Stripe could build the optimal context configuration once, every developer using those services could benefit.\"Kiro powers formalizes things that only the most advanced people were doing, and allows anyone to get those kinds of skills,\" Singh said.Why dynamic loading beats fine-tuning for most AI coding use casesThe announcement also positions Kiro powers as a more economical alternative to fine-tuning, or the process of training an AI model on specialized data to improve its performance in specific domains.\"It&#x27;s much cheaper\" compared to fine-tuning, Singh. \"Fine-tuning is very expensive, and you can&#x27;t fine-tune most frontier models.\"This is a significant point. The most capable AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI and Google are typically \"closed source,\" meaning developers cannot modify their underlying training. They can only influence the models&#x27; behavior through the prompts and context they provide.\"Most people are already using powerful models like Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5,\" Singh said. \"Those models need to be pointed in the right direction.\"The dynamic loading mechanism also reduces ongoing costs. Because powers only activate when relevant, developers aren&#x27;t paying for token usage on tools they&#x27;re not currently using.Where Kiro powers fits into Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI agentsKiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls \"agentic AI\" — AI systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods.At re:Invent, AWS also announced three \"frontier agents\" designed to work for hours or days without human intervention: Kiro autonomous agent for software development, AWS security agent and AWS DevOps agent. These represent a different approach from Kiro powers — tackling large, ambiguous problems rather than providing specialized expertise for specific tasks.The two approaches are complementary. Frontier agents handle complex, multi-day projects that require autonomous decision-making across multiple codebases. Kiro powers, by contrast, gives developers precise, efficient tools for everyday development tasks where speed and token efficiency matter most.The company is betting that developers need both ends of this spectrum to be productive.What Kiro powers reveals about the future of AI-assisted software developmentThe launch reflects a maturing market for AI development tools. GitHub Copilot, which Microsoft launched in 2021, introduced millions of developers to AI-assisted coding. Since then, a proliferation of tools — including Cursor, Cline and Claude Code — have competed for developers&#x27; attention.But as these tools have grown more capable, they&#x27;ve also grown more complex. MCP, which Anthropic open-sourced last year, created a standard for connecting AI agents to external services. That solved one problem while creating another: The context overload that Kiro powers now addresses.AWS is positioning itself as the company that understands production software development at scale. Singh emphasized that Amazon&#x27;s experience running AWS for 20 years, combined with its own massive internal software engineering organization, gives it unique insight into how developers actually work.\"It&#x27;s not something you would use just for your prototype or your toy application,\" he said. \"If you want to build production applications, there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring.\"The road ahead for Kiro powers and cross-platform compatibilityAWS indicated that Kiro powers currently works only within the Kiro IDE, but the company is building toward cross-compatibility with other AI development tools, including command-line interfaces, Cursor, Cline and Claude Code. The company&#x27;s documentation describes a future where developers can \"build a power once, use it anywhere\" — although that vision remains aspirational for now.For the technology partners launching powers today, the appeal is straightforward: Rather than maintaining separate integration documentation for every AI tool on the market, they can create a single power that works everywhere Kiro does. As more AI coding assistants crowd the market, that kind of efficiency becomes increasingly valuable.Kiro powers is available now for developers using Kiro IDE version 0.7 or later at no additional charge beyond the standard Kiro subscription.The underlying bet is a familiar one in the history of computing: The winners in AI-assisted development won&#x27;t be the tools that try to do everything at once, but those that are smart enough to know what to forget.",

          "title": "Gong study: Sales teams using AI generate 77% more revenue per rep",
          "standfirst": "The debate over whether AI belongs in the corporate boardroom appears to be over — at least for those responsible for generating revenue.Seven in 10 enterprise revenue leaders now trust AI to regularly inform their business decisions, according to a sweeping new study released by revenue intelligence company Gong. The finding marks a dramatic shift from just two years ago, when most organizations treated AI as an experimental technology relegated to pilot programs and individual productivity hacks.The research, based on an analysis of 7.1 million sales opportunities across more than 3,600 companies and a survey of over 3,000 global revenue leaders spanning the U.S., UK, Australia and Germany, paints a picture of an industry in rapid transformation. Organizations that have embedded AI into their core go-to-market strategies are 65% more likely to increase their win rates than competitors still treating the technology as optional.\"I don&#x27;t think people delegate decisions to AI, but they do rely on AI in the process of making decisions,\" Amit Bendov, Gong&#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Humans are making the decision, but they&#x27;re largely assisted.\"The distinction matters. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI has become what Bendov describes as a \"second opinion\" — a data-driven check on the intuition and guesswork that has traditionally governed sales forecasting and strategy.Slowing growth is forcing sales teams to squeeze more from every repThe timing of AI&#x27;s ascendance in revenue organizations is no coincidence. The study reveals a sobering reality: After rebounding in 2024, average annual revenue growth among surveyed companies decelerated to 16% in 2025, marking a three-percentage-point decline year over year. Sales rep quota attainment fell from 52% to 46% over the same period.The culprit, according to Gong&#x27;s analysis, isn&#x27;t that salespeople are performing worse on individual deals. Win rates and deal duration remained consistent. The problem is that representatives are working fewer opportunities — a finding that suggests operational inefficiencies are eating into selling time.This helps explain why productivity has rocketed to the top of executive priorities. For the first time in the study&#x27;s history, increasing the productivity of existing teams ranked as the number-one growth strategy for 2026, jumping from fourth place the previous year.\"The focus is on increasing sales productivity,\" Bendov said. \"How much dollar-output per dollar-input?\"The numbers back up the urgency. Teams that regularly use AI tools generate 77% more revenue per representative than those that don&#x27;t — a gap Gong characterizes as a six-figure difference per salesperson annually.Companies are moving beyond basic AI automation toward strategic decision-makingThe nature of AI adoption in sales has evolved considerably over the past year. In 2024, most revenue teams used AI for basic automation: Transcribing calls, drafting emails, updating CRM records. Those use cases continue to grow, but 2025 marked what the report calls a shift \"from automation to intelligence.\"The number of U.S. companies using AI for forecasting and measuring strategic initiatives jumped 50% year over year. These more sophisticated applications — predicting deal outcomes, identifying at-risk accounts, measuring which value propositions resonate with different buyer personas — correlate with dramatically better results.Organizations in the 95th percentile of commercial impact from AI were 2 to 4X more likely to have deployed these strategic use cases, according to the study.Bendov offered a concrete example of how this plays out in practice. \"Companies have thousands of deals that they roll up into their forecast,\" he said. \"It used to be based solely on human sentiment, believe it or not. That&#x27;s why a lot of companies miss their numbers: Because people say, &#x27;Oh, he told me he&#x27;ll buy,&#x27; or &#x27;I think I can probably get this one.&#x27;\"AI changes that calculus by examining evidence rather than optimism. \"Companies now get a second opinion from AI on their forecasting, and that improves forecasting accuracy dramatically — 10 [or] 15% better accuracy just because it&#x27;s evidence-based, not just based on human sentiment,\" Bendov said.Revenue-specific AI tools are dramatically outperforming general-purpose alternativesOne of the study&#x27;s more provocative findings concerns the type of AI that delivers results. Teams using revenue-specific AI solutions — tools built explicitly for sales workflows rather than general-purpose platforms like ChatGPT — reported 13% higher revenue growth and 85% greater commercial impact than those relying on generic tools.These specialized systems were also twice as likely to be deployed for forecasting and predictive modeling, the report found.The finding carries obvious implications for Gong, which sells precisely this type of domain-specific platform. But the data suggests a real distinction in outcomes. General-purpose AI, while more prevalent, often creates what the report describes as a \"blind spot\" for organizations — particularly when employees adopt consumer AI tools without company oversight.Research from MIT suggests that while only 59% of enterprise teams use personal AI tools like ChatGPT at work, the actual figure is likely closer to 90%. This shadow AI usage poses security risks and creates fragmented technology stacks that undermine the potential for organization-wide intelligence.Most sales leaders believe AI will reshape their jobs rather than eliminate themPerhaps the most closely-watched question in any AI study concerns employment. The Gong research offers a more nuanced picture than the apocalyptic predictions that often dominate headlines.When asked about AI&#x27;s three-year impact on revenue headcount, 43% of respondents said they expect it to transform jobs without reducing headcount — the most common response. Only 28% anticipate job eliminations, while 21% actually foresee AI creating new roles. Just 8% predict minimal impact.Bendov frames the opportunity as reclaiming lost time. He cited Forrester research indicating that 77% of a sales representative&#x27;s time is spent on activities that don&#x27;t involve customers — administrative work, meeting preparation, researching accounts, updating forecasts and internal briefings.\"AI can eliminate, ideally, 77% of the drudgery work that they&#x27;re doing,\" Bendov said. \"I don&#x27;t think it necessarily eliminates jobs. People are half productive right now. Let&#x27;s make them fully productive, and whatever you&#x27;re paying them will translate to much higher revenue.\"The transformation is already visible in role consolidation. Over the past decade, sales organizations splintered into hyper-specialized functions: One person qualifies leads, another sets appointments, a third closes deals, a fourth handles onboarding. The result was customers interacting with five or six different people across their buying journey.\"Which is not a great buyer experience, because every time I meet a new person that might not have the full context, and it&#x27;s very inefficient for companies,\" Bendov said. \"Now with AI, you can have one person do all this, or much of this.\"At Gong itself, sellers now generate 80% of their own appointments because AI handles the prospecting legwork, Bendov said.American companies are adopting AI 18 months faster than their European counterpartsThe study reveals a notable divide in AI adoption between the U.S. and Europe. While 87% of U.S. companies now use AI in their revenue operations, with another 9% planning adoption within a year, the UK trails by 12 to 18 months. Just 70% of UK companies currently use AI, with 22% percent planning near-term adoption — figures that mirror U.S. data from 2024.Bendov said the pattern reflects a broader historical tendency for enterprise technology trends to cross the Atlantic with a delay. \"It&#x27;s always like that,\" he said. \"Even when the internet was taking off in the U.S., Europe was a step behind.\"The gap isn&#x27;t permanent, he noted, and Europe sometimes leads on technology adoption — mobile payments and messaging apps like WhatsApp gained traction there before the U.S. — but for AI specifically, the American market remains ahead.Gong says a decade of AI development gives it an edge over Salesforce and MicrosoftThe findings arrive as Gong navigates an increasingly crowded market. The company, which recently surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenue, faces potential competition from enterprise software giants like Salesforce and Microsoft, both of which are embedding AI capabilities into their platforms.Bendov argues that Gong&#x27;s decade of AI development creates a substantial barrier to entry. The company&#x27;s architecture comprises three layers: a \"revenue graph\" that aggregates customer data from CRM systems, emails, calls, videos and web signals; an intelligence layer combining large language models (LLMs) with approximately 40 proprietary small language models; and workflow applications built on top.\"Anybody that would want to build something like that — it&#x27;s not a small feature, it&#x27;s 10 years in development—would need first to build the revenue graph,\" Bendov said.Rather than viewing Salesforce and Microsoft as threats, Bendov characterized them as partners, pointing to both companies&#x27; participation in Gong&#x27;s recent user conference to discuss agent interoperability. The rise of MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and consumption-based pricing models means customers can mix AI agents from multiple vendors rather than committing to a single platform.The real question is whether AI will expand the sales profession or hollow it outThe report&#x27;s implications extend beyond sales departments. If AI can transform revenue operations — long considered a relationship-driven, human-centric function — it raises questions about which other business processes might be next.Bendov sees the potential for expansion rather than contraction. Drawing an analogy to digital photography, he noted that while camera manufacturers suffered, the total number of photos taken exploded once smartphones made photography effortless.\"If AI makes selling simple, I could see a world [with] maybe ten times more jobs than we have now,\" said Bendov.\" It&#x27;s expensive and inefficient today, but if it becomes as easy as taking a photo, the industry could actually grow and create opportunities for people of different abilities, from different locations.\"For Bendov, who co-founded Gong in 2015 when AI was still a hard sell to non-technical business users, the current moment represents something he waited a decade to see. Back then, mentioning AI to sales executives sounded like science fiction. The company struggled to raise money because the underlying technology barely existed.\"When we started the company, we were born as an AI company, but we had to almost hide AI,\" Bendov recalled. \"It was intimidating.\"Now, seven out of 10of those same executives say they trust AI to help run their business. The technology that once had to be disguised has become the one thing nobody can afford to ignore.",

The result was customers interacting with five or six different people across their buying journey.\"Which is not a great buyer experience, because every time I meet a new person that might not have the full context, and it&#x27;s very inefficient for companies,\" Bendov said. \"Now with AI, you can have one person do all this, or much of this.\"At Gong itself, sellers now generate 80% of their own appointments because AI handles the prospecting legwork, Bendov said.American companies are adopting AI 18 months faster than their European counterpartsThe study reveals a notable divide in AI adoption between the U.S. and Europe. While 87% of U.S. companies now use AI in their revenue operations, with another 9% planning adoption within a year, the UK trails by 12 to 18 months. Just 70% of UK companies currently use AI, with 22% percent planning near-term adoption — figures that mirror U.S. data from 2024.Bendov said the pattern reflects a broader historical tendency for enterprise technology trends to cross the Atlantic with a delay. \"It&#x27;s always like that,\" he said. \"Even when the internet was taking off in the U.S., Europe was a step behind.\"The gap isn&#x27;t permanent, he noted, and Europe sometimes leads on technology adoption — mobile payments and messaging apps like WhatsApp gained traction there before the U.S. — but for AI specifically, the American market remains ahead.Gong says a decade of AI development gives it an edge over Salesforce and MicrosoftThe findings arrive as Gong navigates an increasingly crowded market. The company, which recently surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenue, faces potential competition from enterprise software giants like Salesforce and Microsoft, both of which are embedding AI capabilities into their platforms.Bendov argues that Gong&#x27;s decade of AI development creates a substantial barrier to entry. The company&#x27;s architecture comprises three layers: a \"revenue graph\" that aggregates customer data from CRM systems, emails, calls, videos and web signals; an intelligence layer combining large language models (LLMs) with approximately 40 proprietary small language models; and workflow applications built on top.\"Anybody that would want to build something like that — it&#x27;s not a small feature, it&#x27;s 10 years in development—would need first to build the revenue graph,\" Bendov said.Rather than viewing Salesforce and Microsoft as threats, Bendov characterized them as partners, pointing to both companies&#x27; participation in Gong&#x27;s recent user conference to discuss agent interoperability. The rise of MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and consumption-based pricing models means customers can mix AI agents from multiple vendors rather than committing to a single platform.The real question is whether AI will expand the sales profession or hollow it outThe report&#x27;s implications extend beyond sales departments. If AI can transform revenue operations — long considered a relationship-driven, human-centric function — it raises questions about which other business processes might be next.Bendov sees the potential for expansion rather than contraction. Drawing an analogy to digital photography, he noted that while camera manufacturers suffered, the total number of photos taken exploded once smartphones made photography effortless.\"If AI makes selling simple, I could see a world [with] maybe ten times more jobs than we have now,\" said Bendov.\" It&#x27;s expensive and inefficient today, but if it becomes as easy as taking a photo, the industry could actually grow and create opportunities for people of different abilities, from different locations.\"For Bendov, who co-founded Gong in 2015 when AI was still a hard sell to non-technical business users, the current moment represents something he waited a decade to see. Back then, mentioning AI to sales executives sounded like science fiction. The company struggled to raise money because the underlying technology barely existed.\"When we started the company, we were born as an AI company, but we had to almost hide AI,\" Bendov recalled. \"It was intimidating.\"Now, seven out of 10of those same executives say they trust AI to help run their business. The technology that once had to be disguised has become the one thing nobody can afford to ignore.",

          "content": "The Black Death ravaged medieval Western Europe, ultimately wiping out roughly one-third of the population. Scientists have identified the bacterium responsible and its likely origins, but certain specifics of how and why it spread to Europe are less clear. According to a new paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, either one large volcanic eruption or a cluster of eruptions might have been the triggering factor, setting off a chain of events that brought the plague to the Mediterranean region in the 1340s. Technically, we’re talking about the second plague pandemic. The first, known as the Justinian Plague, broke out about 541 CE and quickly spread across Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. (The Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I, for whom the pandemic is named, actually survived the disease.) There continued to be outbreaks of the plague over the next 300 years, although the disease gradually became less virulent and died out. Or so it seemed. In the Middle Ages, the Black Death burst onto the scene, with the first historically documented outbreak occurring in 1346 in the Lower Volga and Black Sea regions. That was just the beginning of the second pandemic. During the 1630s, fresh outbreaks of plague killed half the populations of affected cities. Another bout of the plague significantly culled the population of France during an outbreak between 1647 and 1649, followed by an epidemic in London in the summer of 1665. The latter was so virulent that, by October, one in 10 Londoners had succumbed to the disease—over 60,000 people. Similar numbers perished in an outbreak in Holland in the 1660s. The pandemic had run its course by the early 19th century, but a third plague pandemic hit China and India in the 1890s. There are still occasional outbreaks today.Read full article Comments",

I wouldn’t recommend making your own version of this build, especially with RAM prices as they currently are, but there are all kinds of inexpensive mini PCs on Amazon with the same GPU, and they’ll all be pretty good at playing the kinds of games that already run well on the less-powerful Steam Deck. But this kind of hardware is an imperfect proxy for the Steam Machine that Valve plans to launch sometime next year—that box will include a dedicated GPU with 8GB of dedicated video memory, presenting both benefits and possible pitfalls compared to a system with an integrated GPU. As a last pre-Steam Machine follow-up to our coverage so far, we’ve run tests on several games we test regularly in our GPU reviews to get a sense of how current versions of SteamOS stack up to Windows running on the same hardware. What we’ve found so far is basically the inverse of what we found when comparing handhelds: Windows usually has an edge on SteamOS’s performance, and sometimes that gap is quite large. And SteamOS also exacerbates problems with 8GB GPUs, hitting apparent RAM limits in more games and at lower resolutions compared to Windows.Read full article Comments",

Martin’s Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas. HBO clearly has a lot of confidence in this series; it’s already been renewed for a second season. And judging by the final trailer, that optimism is warranted. As we’ve previously reported, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms adapts the first novella in the series, The Hedge Knight, and is set 50 years after the events of House of the Dragon. Per the official premise: A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named “Dunk,” along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka “Egg,” a child prince and Dunk’s squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg’s older brother, Prince Aerion “Brightflame” Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg’s uncle, Prince Baelor “Breakspear” Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dornish puppeteer named Tanselle; Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel “Laughing Storm” Baratheon, heir to House Baratheon; and Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Egg’s father.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "There’s some Toyota news today that doesn’t involve the chairman wearing a MAGA hat. The Japanese automaker evidently decided it’s been too long since it flexed its engineering chops on something with two doors and plenty of power, so it has rectified that situation with a new flagship coupe for its Gazoo Racing sporty sub-brand. Meet the GR GT, which looks set to go on sale toward the end of next year. The Camry-esque look at the front, and to an extent the rear, came second to the GR GT’s aerodynamics, which is the opposite way to how Toyota usually styles its cars. It’s built around a highly rigid aluminum frame—Toyota’s first, apparently—with carbon fiber for the hood, roof, and some other body panels to minimize weight. The automaker says that lowering the car’s center of gravity was a top priority, and weight balance and distribution also help explain the transaxle layout, where the car’s transmission is behind the cockpit and between the rear wheels. I get a LOT of Camry from the nose. Credit: Toyota We're told it will have a good V8 sound. Credit: Toyota Does this interior befit a coupe that will cost about half a million dollars? Credit: Toyota I mostly posted this because of the license plate. Credit: Toyota Aluminum forms the chassis. Credit: Toyota The transaxle-layout powertrain. Credit: Toyota The seats look grippy. Credit: Toyota That transaxle transmission will be an eight-speed automatic that uses a wet clutch instead of a torque converter and into which the car’s hybrid motor is integrated. Power from the 4.0 L twin-turbo V8 and the hybrid system should be a combined 641 hp (478 kW) and 626 lb-ft (850 Nm). Despite the aluminum frame and use of composites, the GT GR is no featherweight; it will weigh as much as 3,858 lb (1,750 kg). The V8 is a new design with a short stroke, a hot-V configuration for the turbochargers, and dry sump lubrication.Read full article Comments",

The 22 Arab region countries covered in the WMO’s new State of the Climate report produce about a quarter of the world’s oil, yet directly account for only 5 to 7 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions from their own territories. The climate paradox positions the region as both a linchpin of the global fossil-fuel economy and one of the most vulnerable geographic areas. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said extreme heat is pushing communities in the region to their physical limits. Droughts show no sign of letting up in one of the world’s most water-stressed regions, but at the same time, parts of it have been devastated by record rains and flooding, she added.Read full article Comments",

A Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired from an underground silo on the country’s southern steppe on November 28 on a scheduled test to deliver a dummy warhead to a remote impact zone nearly 4,000 miles away. The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet, Ars reports. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site.Read full article Comments",

He now faces a maximum sentence of up to 70 years in prison that could be coupled with “a fine of up to $3.5 million,” the DOJ said. The podcaster—who primarily posted about “his desire to find a wife and his interactions with women”—allegedly harassed and sometimes even doxxed his victims through his videos on platforms including Instagram, Spotify, and TikTok. Over time, his videos and podcasts documented his intense desire to start a family, which was frustrated by his “anger towards women,” whom he claimed were “all the same from fucking 18 to fucking 40 to fucking 90” and “trash.”Read full article Comments",

The Department of Justice on Thursday said that Muneeb Akhter and Sohaib Akhter, both 34, of Alexandria, Virginia, deleted databases and documents maintained and belonging to three government agencies. The brothers were federal contractors working for an undisclosed company in Washington, DC, that provides software and services to 45 US agencies. Prosecutors said the men coordinated the crimes and began carrying them out just minutes after being fired. Using AI to cover up an alleged crime—what could go wrong? On February 18 at roughly 4:55 pm, the men were fired from the company, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday. Five minutes later, they allegedly began trying to access their employer’s system and access federal government databases. By then, access to one of the brothers’ accounts had already been terminated. The other brother, however, allegedly accessed a government agency’s database stored on the employer’s server and issued commands to prevent other users from connecting or making changes to the database. Then, prosecutors said, he issued a command to delete 96 databases, many of which contained sensitive investigative files and records related to Freedom of Information Act matters.Read full article Comments",

Prior to today’s 6–3 vote to delay a decision, there was a swirl of confusion over the wording of what a new recommendation would be. Panel members had gotten three different versions of the proposed recommendation in the 72 hours prior to the meeting, one panelist said. And the meeting’s data presentations this morning offered no clarity on the subject—they were delivered entirely by anti-vaccine activists who have no subject matter expertise and who made a dizzying amount of false and absurd claims. “Completely inappropriate” Overall, the meeting was disorganized and farcical. Kennedy’s panel has abandoned the evidence-based framework for setting vaccine policy in favor of airing unvetted presentations with misrepresentations, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picked studies.

The language emerged from a frantic 10-day sprint at pioneering browser company Netscape, where engineer Brendan Eich hacked together a working internal prototype during May 1995. While the JavaScript language didn’t ship publicly until that September and didn’t reach a 1.0 release until March 1996, the descendants of Eich’s initial 10-day hack now run on approximately 98.9 percent of all websites with client-side code, making JavaScript the dominant programming language of the web. It’s wildly popular; beyond the browser, JavaScript powers server backends, mobile apps, desktop software, and even some embedded systems. According to several surveys, JavaScript consistently ranks among the most widely used programming languages in the world. In crafting JavaScript, Netscape wanted a scripting language that could make webpages interactive, something lightweight that would appeal to web designers and non-professional programmers. Eich drew from several influences: The syntax looked like a trendy new programming language called Java to satisfy Netscape management, but its guts borrowed concepts from Scheme, a language Eich admired, and Self, which contributed JavaScript’s prototype-based object model.Read full article Comments",

Features like fingerprint authentication and end-to-end encryption are designed for user privacy and security. The average person is most likely to be familiar with E2EE through messaging apps, like Signal. Messages sent via apps with E2EE are encrypted throughout transmission.

          "content": "When Valve announced its upcoming Steam Machine hardware last month, some eagle-eyed gamers may have been surprised to see that the official spec sheet lists support for HDMI 2.0 output, rather than the updated, higher-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 standard introduced in 2017. Now, Valve tells Ars that, while the hardware itself actually supports HDMI 2.1, the company is struggling to offer full support for that standard due to Linux drivers that are “still a work-in-progress on the software side.” As we noted last year, the HDMI Forum (which manages the official specifications for HDMI standards) has officially blocked any open source implementation of HDMI 2.1. That means the open source AMD drivers used by SteamOS can’t fully implement certain features that are specific to the updated output standard. “At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements,” AMD engineer Alex Deucher said at the time.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "OnePlus is ready to sell its new flagship smartphone in the US weeks after it made the device official. Having now finally gotten Federal Communications Commission clearance, the OnePlus 15 is available for preorder. It’s currently only live on the OnePlus storefront, but the device will eventually come to Amazon and Best Buy as well. The OnePlus 15 launched in China earlier this year, and it was supposed to go on sale in the US a month ago. However, the longest US government shutdown on record got in the way. Most of the FCC’s functions were suspended during the weekslong funding lapse, which prevented the agency from certifying new wireless products. Without that approval, OnePlus could not begin selling the phone. Thus, it had no firm release date when the phone was officially unveiled for the US in early November. Interested parties can head to the OnePlus website to place an order. The base model starts at $900 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This version is only available in black. If you want the Ultraviolet or Sand Storm (with the distinctive micro-arc oxidation finish), you’ll have to upgrade to the $1,000 version, which has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Necrobotics is a field of engineering that builds robots out of a mix of synthetic materials and animal body parts. It has produced micro-grippers with pneumatically operated legs taken from dead spiders and walking robots based on deceased cockroaches. “These necrobotics papers inspired us to build something different,” said Changhong Cao, a mechanical engineering professor at the McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Cao’s team didn’t go for a robot—instead, it adapted a female mosquito proboscis to work as a nozzle in a super-precise 3D printer. And it worked surprisingly well. Fangs and stings To find the right nozzle for their 3D necroprinting system, Cao’s team began with a broad survey of natural micro-dispensing tips. The researchers examined stingers of bees, wasps, and scorpions; the fangs of venomous snakes; and the claws of centipedes. All of those evolved to deliver a fluid to the target, which is roughly what a 3D printer’s nozzle does. But they all had issues. “Some were too curved and curved for high-precision 3D printing,” Cao explained. “Also, they were optimized for delivering pulses of venom, not for a steady, continuous flow, which is what you need for printing.”Read full article Comments",
