This expansion of genetic surveillance was never authorized by Congress for citizens, children, or civil detainees. According to newly released government data analyzed by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, collected the DNA of nearly 2,000 US citizens between 2020 and 2024 and had it sent to CODIS, the FBI’s nationwide system for policing investigations. An estimated 95 were minors, some as young as 14. The entries also include travelers never charged with a crime and dozens of cases where agents left the “charges” field blank. In other files, officers invoked civil penalties as justification for swabs that federal law reserves for criminal arrests. The findings appear to point to a program running outside the bounds of statute or oversight, experts say, with CBP officers exercising broad discretion to capture genetic material from Americans and have it funneled into a law-enforcement database designed in part for convicted offenders. Critics warn that anyone added to the database could endure heightened scrutiny by US law enforcement for life.Read full article Comments",

However, that era seems set to end as Sony announced during this evening's State of Play livestream that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8. No, that's not a typo. Credit: Sony The move isn't entirely shocking for modern Microsoft, which has been publishing previous Xbox exclusives on competing consoles in increasing numbers for a while now. And Flight Simulator 2024 has been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a \"timed exclusive\" at least. Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name integrated into its title moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this.

NWS is a horrifying parasitic fly that attacks warm-blooded animals, laying hundreds of eggs in any openings or wounds, even minute ones. The resulting larvae both look and act like screws, boring and twisting into the animal while feasting on its living flesh. The ravenous larvae create ghastly wounds that can be deadly to livestock and wild animals. Long ago, this ferocious fly was endemic in the US and stymied the livestock industry. However, in the 1950s, eradication efforts using sterile male flies and livestock monitoring began to push the fly population southward. By around 1966, it was cleared from the US, and Mexico zapped the population in the 1980s. By 2006, it was pushed out of Central America, with Panama declaring it eradicated and holding the flies at bay at the Darién Gap at the border with Colombia. However, in 2022, the gap was breached, and the flies have been steadily moving northward.Read full article Comments",

Archaeologists have long sought to locate her tomb, which she shared with her lover, Mark Antony, per popular legend. Thus far, the search has been unsuccessful, although many believe she would have been buried near the royal palace in Alexandria, Egypt. National Geographic explorer Kathleen Martinez thinks she might be on the verge of locating Cleopatra's final resting place at a site called Taposiris Magna. Her 20-year journey (and counting) to prove her hypothesis—and the exciting new discovery of a submerged ancient port several miles off the Mediterranean shore that was likely once part of that temple—are chronicled in Cleopatra's Final Secret, a new documentary film from National Geographic. Martinez has a degree in archaeology but initially became a criminal lawyer. She brought that legal training to bear on the question of the location of Cleopatra's tomb, treating it as she would a forensic case. \"I tried to understand her personality, who were her friends, who were her enemies,\" Martinez told Ars. \"She was a strategist and she always had a Plan A and a Plan B.\" It simply made sense to her that Cleopatra would have brought that same strategic thinking to orchestrating her death. Martinez suggested that the queen arranged for loyal subjects to transport her body through secret tunnels to a hidden final resting place.Read full article Comments",

However, we're willing to bet your backlog can't hold a candle to that of SonixLegend, who recently earned a unique Steam badge as the first person to own 40,000 distinct paid games on Valve's platform. Based in Shanghai, SonixLegend obtained their 40,000th Steam game this week, according to Steam's badge data, putting them atop an elite club of just 19 Steam users with at least 30,000 paid games. According to SteamDB tracking, that makes for an account roughly worth anywhere from $248,000 (based on the lowest prices ever tracked in the database) to $642,000 (based on the current prices of those games). However, SonixLegend's full collection might be more extensive than this massive achievement suggests. That's because Steam's Game Collector badges don't track any of the many, many shovelware titles that have failed to reach \"broad player engagement and some commercial success\" on the service under Valve's \"profile features\" guidelines. It also reportedly doesn't include almost all free-to-play games, which could easily be used to inflate a title count for determined badge chasers.Read full article Comments",

Trump was there with his health secretary, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to link autism to the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy. While medical experts condemn the claim as unproven and dangerous (which it is), Kennedy's anti-vaccine followers decried it as a distraction from their favored false and dangerous explanation—that vaccines cause autism (which they don't). Pinning the blame on Tylenol instead of vaccines enraged Kennedy's own anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense. In the run-up to the event Monday evening, CHD retweeted an all-caps defense of Tylenol, and CHD President Mary Holland called the announcement a \"sideshow\" in an interview with Steve Bannon.Read full article Comments",

The rare export curbs could hit South Africa's \"electronics, telecom, and auto parts sectors\" hard, MSN reported, if South Africa doesn't meet with Taiwan to discuss better terms within the next 60 days.Read full article Comments",

In 2008, when Apple took the very first MacBook Air out of a manila envelope, it was not positioned as Apple's new entry-level Mac laptop. The innovative but flawed system started at $1,799, far above the $999 price of the entry-level plastic MacBook and well into MacBook Pro territory. In those early, formative years, the \"Air\" branding denoted not a midrange or entry-level model but an alternate branching path from the baseline MacBook. Paying Apple more money could get you more computer—the Pro model, with more processor, more screen, more storage, more everything—or it could get you a different kind of computer, with fundamentally different benefits and trade-offs.Read full article Comments",

Disney suspended Kimmel's show last week after Carr said ABC affiliates could have licenses revoked for \"news distortion,\" but reinstated Kimmel yesterday after facing backlash from the public.

Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, IT: Welcome to Derry, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut. (Some spoilers below for IT and IT: Chapter Two.) As previously reported, set in 1989, IT essentially adapted half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves \"The Losers Club.\" The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.Read full article Comments",

They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it. New research released earlier this month titled \"We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof\" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3. A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces \"TAAROFBENCH,\" the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.Read full article Comments",

Ars first covered the technology, known as vehicle-to-grid or V2G, back in 2009 when Ford and American Electric Power in Ohio started playing with the idea, although that pilot involved hybrids rather than battery EVs. A couple of years later, General Motors tried something similar with the plug-in hybrid Volt, and since then, battery EVs with much larger lithium-ion packs have gotten in on the act, although such pilot programs have invariably involved commercial EV fleets. More recently, we've started seeing EVs that have been designed from the ground up to be capable of bidirectional charging. And since July, some owners of Ford F-150 Lightnings have been sending stored energy back into the grid between 5 pm and 9 pm on weekdays, earning them some cash in the process. Sunrun, which provides home energy storage and solar solutions, started working with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company on the project last year. This summer, it expanded its work to include the nation's first residential V2G pilot, with a trio of Lightning owners using Sunrun and Ford's Home Integration System. Participants can earn up to $1,000 from the program, which runs until the end of this month.Read full article Comments",

He said that the insufficient fix was meant to patch CVE-2024-10237, a high-severity vulnerability that enabled attackers to reflash firmware that runs while a machine is booting. Binarly discovered a second critical vulnerability that allows the same sort of attack. “Unprecedented persistence” Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to install firmware similar to ILObleed, an implant discovered in 2021 that infected HP Enterprise servers with wiper firmware that permanently destroyed data stored on hard drives. Even after administrators reinstalled the operating system, swapped out hard drives, or took other common disinfection steps, ILObleed would remain intact and reactivate the disk-wiping attack. The exploit the attackers used in that campaign had been patched by HP four years earlier but wasn’t installed in the compromised devices.Read full article Comments",

Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration. Alphabet made this announcement via a lengthy letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube. For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it \"appreciates the accountability\" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.Read full article Comments",

But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in a paper published in the Journal of Ethology. It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now. Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.Read full article Comments",
