          "title": "Databricks' OfficeQA uncovers disconnect: AI agents ace abstract tests but stall at 45% on enterprise docs",
          "standfirst": "There is no shortage of AI benchmarks in the market today, with popular options like Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam (HLE), ARC-AGI-2 and GDPval, among numerous others.AI agents excel at solving abstract math problems and passing PhD-level exams that most benchmarks are based on, but Databricks has a question for the enterprise: Can they actually handle the document-heavy work most enterprises need them to do?The answer, according to new research from the data and AI platform company, is sobering. Even the best-performing AI agents achieve less than 45% accuracy on tasks that mirror real enterprise workloads, exposing a critical gap between academic benchmarks and business reality.\"If we focus our research efforts on getting better at [existing benchmarks], then we&#x27;re probably not solving the right problems to make Databricks a better platform,\" Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, explained to VentureBeat. \"So that&#x27;s why we were looking around. How do we create a benchmark that, if we get better at it, we&#x27;re actually getting better at solving the problems that our customers have?\"The result is OfficeQA, a benchmark designed to test AI agents on grounded reasoning: Answering questions based on complex proprietary datasets containing unstructured documents and tabular data. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on abstract capabilities, OfficeQA proxies for the economically valuable tasks enterprises actually perform.Why academic benchmarks miss the enterprise markThere are numerous shortcomings of popular AI benchmarks from an enterprise perspective, according to Elsen. HLE features questions requiring PhD-level expertise across diverse fields. ARC-AGI evaluates abstract reasoning through visual manipulation of colored grids. Both push the frontiers of AI capabilities, but don&#x27;t reflect daily enterprise work. Even GDPval, which was specifically created to evaluate economically useful tasks, misses the target.\"We come from a pretty heavy science or engineering background, and sometimes we create evals that reflect that,\" Elsen said. \" So they&#x27;re either extremely math-heavy, which is a great, useful task, but advancing the frontiers of human mathematics is not what customers are trying to do with Databricks.\"While AI is commonly used for customer support and coding apps, Databricks&#x27; customer base has a broader set of requirements. Elsen noted that answering questions about documents or corpora of documents is a common enterprise task. These require parsing complex tables with nested headers, retrieving information across dozens or hundreds of documents and performing calculations where a single-digit error can cascade into organizations making incorrect business decisions.Building a benchmark that mirrors enterprise document complexityTo create a meaningful test of grounded reasoning capabilities, Databricks needed a dataset that approximates the messy reality of proprietary enterprise document corpora, while remaining freely available for research. The team landed on U.S. Treasury Bulletins, published monthly for five decades beginning in 1939 and quarterly thereafter.The Treasury Bulletins check every box for enterprise document complexity. Each bulletin runs 100 to 200 pages and consists of prose, complex tables, charts and figures describing Treasury operations: Where federal money came from, where it went and how it financed government operations. The corpus spans approximately 89,000 pages across eight decades. Until 1996, the bulletins were scans of physical documents; afterwards, they were digitally produced PDFs. USAFacts, an organization whose mission is \"to make government data easier to access and understand,\" partnered with Databricks to develop the benchmark, identifying Treasury Bulletins as ideal and ensuring questions reflected realistic use cases.The 246 questions require agents to handle messy, real-world document challenges: Scanned images, hierarchical table structures, temporal data spanning multiple reports and the need for external knowledge like inflation adjustments. Questions range from simple value lookups to multi-step analysis requiring statistical calculations and cross-year comparisons.To ensure the benchmark requires actual document-grounded retrieval, Databricks filtered out questions that LLMs could answer using parametric knowledge or web search alone. This removed simpler questions and some surprisingly complex ones where models leveraged historical financial records memorized during pre-training.Every question has a validated ground truth answer (typically a number, sometimes dates or small lists), enabling automated evaluation without human judging. This design choice matters: It allows reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that require verifiable rewards, similar to how models train on coding problems.Current performance exposes fundamental gapsDatabricks tested Claude Opus 4.5 Agent (using Claude&#x27;s SDK) and GPT-5.1 Agent (using OpenAI&#x27;s File Search API). The results should give pause to any enterprise betting heavily on current agent capabilities.When provided with raw PDF documents: Claude Opus 4.5 Agent (with default thinking=high) achieved 37.4% accuracy. GPT-5.1 Agent (with reasoning_effort=high) achieved 43.5% accuracy. However, performance improved noticeably when provided with pre-parsed versions of pages using Databricks&#x27; ai_parse_document, indicating that the poor raw PDF performance stems from LLM APIs struggling with parsing rather than reasoning. Even with parsed documents, the experiments show room for improvement.When provided with documents parsed using Databricks&#x27; ai_parse_document:Claude Opus 4.5 Agent achieved 67.8% accuracy (a +30.4 percentage point improvement)GPT-5.1 Agent achieved a 52.8% accuracy (a +9.3 percentage point improvement)Three findings that matter for enterprise deploymentsThe testing identified critical insights for practitioners:Parsing remains the fundamental blocker: Complex tables with nested headers, merged cells and unusual formatting frequently produce misaligned values. Even when given exact oracle pages, agents struggled primarily due to parsing errors, although performance roughly doubled with pre-parsed documents.Document versioning creates ambiguity: Financial and regulatory documents get revised and reissued, meaning multiple valid answers exist depending on the publication date. Agents often stop searching once they find a plausible answer, missing more authoritative sources.Visual reasoning is a gap: About 3% of questions require chart or graph interpretation, where current agents consistently fail. For enterprises where data visualizations communicate critical insights, this represents a meaningful capability limitation.How enterprises can use OfficeQAThe benchmark&#x27;s design enables specific improvement paths beyond simple scoring. \"Since you&#x27;re able to look at the right answer, it&#x27;s easy to tell if the error is coming from parsing,\" Elsen explained. This automated evaluation enables rapid iteration on parsing pipelines. The verified ground truth answers also enable RL training similar to coding benchmarks, since there&#x27;s no human judgment required.Elsen said the benchmark provides \"a really strong feedback signal\" for developers working on search solutions. However, he cautioned against treating it as training data.\"At least in my imagination, the goal of releasing this is more as an eval and not as a source of raw training data,\" he said. \"If you tune too specifically into this environment, then it&#x27;s not clear how generalizable your agent results would be.\"What this means for enterprise AI deploymentsFor enterprises currently deploying or planning document-heavy AI agent systems, OfficeQA provides a sobering reality check. Even the latest frontier models achieve only 43% accuracy on unprocessed PDFs and fall short of 70% accuracy even with optimal document parsing. Performance on the hardest questions plateaus at 40%, indicating substantial room for improvement.Three immediate implications:Evaluate your document complexity: If your documents resemble the complexity profile of Treasury Bulletins (scanned images, nested table structures, cross-document references), expect accuracy well below vendor marketing claims. Test on your actual documents before production deployment.Plan for the parsing bottleneck: The test results indicate that parsing remains a fundamental blocker.

Plan for hard question failure modes: Even with optimal parsing, agents plateau at 40% on complex multi-step questions.

          "content": "There is no shortage of AI benchmarks in the market today, with popular options like Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam (HLE), ARC-AGI-2 and GDPval, among numerous others.AI agents excel at solving abstract math problems and passing PhD-level exams that most benchmarks are based on, but Databricks has a question for the enterprise: Can they actually handle the document-heavy work most enterprises need them to do?The answer, according to new research from the data and AI platform company, is sobering. Even the best-performing AI agents achieve less than 45% accuracy on tasks that mirror real enterprise workloads, exposing a critical gap between academic benchmarks and business reality.\"If we focus our research efforts on getting better at [existing benchmarks], then we&#x27;re probably not solving the right problems to make Databricks a better platform,\" Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, explained to VentureBeat. \"So that&#x27;s why we were looking around. How do we create a benchmark that, if we get better at it, we&#x27;re actually getting better at solving the problems that our customers have?\"The result is OfficeQA, a benchmark designed to test AI agents on grounded reasoning: Answering questions based on complex proprietary datasets containing unstructured documents and tabular data. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on abstract capabilities, OfficeQA proxies for the economically valuable tasks enterprises actually perform.Why academic benchmarks miss the enterprise markThere are numerous shortcomings of popular AI benchmarks from an enterprise perspective, according to Elsen. HLE features questions requiring PhD-level expertise across diverse fields. ARC-AGI evaluates abstract reasoning through visual manipulation of colored grids. Both push the frontiers of AI capabilities, but don&#x27;t reflect daily enterprise work. Even GDPval, which was specifically created to evaluate economically useful tasks, misses the target.\"We come from a pretty heavy science or engineering background, and sometimes we create evals that reflect that,\" Elsen said. \" So they&#x27;re either extremely math-heavy, which is a great, useful task, but advancing the frontiers of human mathematics is not what customers are trying to do with Databricks.\"While AI is commonly used for customer support and coding apps, Databricks&#x27; customer base has a broader set of requirements. Elsen noted that answering questions about documents or corpora of documents is a common enterprise task. These require parsing complex tables with nested headers, retrieving information across dozens or hundreds of documents and performing calculations where a single-digit error can cascade into organizations making incorrect business decisions.Building a benchmark that mirrors enterprise document complexityTo create a meaningful test of grounded reasoning capabilities, Databricks needed a dataset that approximates the messy reality of proprietary enterprise document corpora, while remaining freely available for research. The team landed on U.S. Treasury Bulletins, published monthly for five decades beginning in 1939 and quarterly thereafter.The Treasury Bulletins check every box for enterprise document complexity. Each bulletin runs 100 to 200 pages and consists of prose, complex tables, charts and figures describing Treasury operations: Where federal money came from, where it went and how it financed government operations. The corpus spans approximately 89,000 pages across eight decades. Until 1996, the bulletins were scans of physical documents; afterwards, they were digitally produced PDFs. USAFacts, an organization whose mission is \"to make government data easier to access and understand,\" partnered with Databricks to develop the benchmark, identifying Treasury Bulletins as ideal and ensuring questions reflected realistic use cases.The 246 questions require agents to handle messy, real-world document challenges: Scanned images, hierarchical table structures, temporal data spanning multiple reports and the need for external knowledge like inflation adjustments. Questions range from simple value lookups to multi-step analysis requiring statistical calculations and cross-year comparisons.To ensure the benchmark requires actual document-grounded retrieval, Databricks filtered out questions that LLMs could answer using parametric knowledge or web search alone. This removed simpler questions and some surprisingly complex ones where models leveraged historical financial records memorized during pre-training.Every question has a validated ground truth answer (typically a number, sometimes dates or small lists), enabling automated evaluation without human judging. This design choice matters: It allows reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that require verifiable rewards, similar to how models train on coding problems.Current performance exposes fundamental gapsDatabricks tested Claude Opus 4.5 Agent (using Claude&#x27;s SDK) and GPT-5.1 Agent (using OpenAI&#x27;s File Search API). The results should give pause to any enterprise betting heavily on current agent capabilities.When provided with raw PDF documents: Claude Opus 4.5 Agent (with default thinking=high) achieved 37.4% accuracy. GPT-5.1 Agent (with reasoning_effort=high) achieved 43.5% accuracy. However, performance improved noticeably when provided with pre-parsed versions of pages using Databricks&#x27; ai_parse_document, indicating that the poor raw PDF performance stems from LLM APIs struggling with parsing rather than reasoning. Even with parsed documents, the experiments show room for improvement.When provided with documents parsed using Databricks&#x27; ai_parse_document:Claude Opus 4.5 Agent achieved 67.8% accuracy (a +30.4 percentage point improvement)GPT-5.1 Agent achieved a 52.8% accuracy (a +9.3 percentage point improvement)Three findings that matter for enterprise deploymentsThe testing identified critical insights for practitioners:Parsing remains the fundamental blocker: Complex tables with nested headers, merged cells and unusual formatting frequently produce misaligned values. Even when given exact oracle pages, agents struggled primarily due to parsing errors, although performance roughly doubled with pre-parsed documents.Document versioning creates ambiguity: Financial and regulatory documents get revised and reissued, meaning multiple valid answers exist depending on the publication date. Agents often stop searching once they find a plausible answer, missing more authoritative sources.Visual reasoning is a gap: About 3% of questions require chart or graph interpretation, where current agents consistently fail. For enterprises where data visualizations communicate critical insights, this represents a meaningful capability limitation.How enterprises can use OfficeQAThe benchmark&#x27;s design enables specific improvement paths beyond simple scoring. \"Since you&#x27;re able to look at the right answer, it&#x27;s easy to tell if the error is coming from parsing,\" Elsen explained. This automated evaluation enables rapid iteration on parsing pipelines. The verified ground truth answers also enable RL training similar to coding benchmarks, since there&#x27;s no human judgment required.Elsen said the benchmark provides \"a really strong feedback signal\" for developers working on search solutions. However, he cautioned against treating it as training data.\"At least in my imagination, the goal of releasing this is more as an eval and not as a source of raw training data,\" he said. \"If you tune too specifically into this environment, then it&#x27;s not clear how generalizable your agent results would be.\"What this means for enterprise AI deploymentsFor enterprises currently deploying or planning document-heavy AI agent systems, OfficeQA provides a sobering reality check. Even the latest frontier models achieve only 43% accuracy on unprocessed PDFs and fall short of 70% accuracy even with optimal document parsing. Performance on the hardest questions plateaus at 40%, indicating substantial room for improvement.Three immediate implications:Evaluate your document complexity: If your documents resemble the complexity profile of Treasury Bulletins (scanned images, nested table structures, cross-document references), expect accuracy well below vendor marketing claims. Test on your actual documents before production deployment.Plan for the parsing bottleneck: The test results indicate that parsing remains a fundamental blocker. Budget time and resources for custom parsing solutions rather than assuming off-the-shelf OCR will suffice. Plan for hard question failure modes: Even with optimal parsing, agents plateau at 40% on complex multi-step questions. For mission-critical document workflows that require multi-document analysis, statistical calculations or visual reasoning, current agent capabilities may not be ready without significant human oversight.For enterprises looking to lead in AI-powered document intelligence, this benchmark provides a concrete evaluation framework and identifies specific capability gaps that need solving.",

          "standfirst": "When someone asks me for gadget buying advice, I normally tell them to stick with their current device. In 2025, most new tech products aren't a worthwhile upgrade over even something that was released a few years ago — and with the price of everything going up, that new iPhone can wait. But things aren't normal right now. On December 3, The Wall Street Journal reported memory manufacturer Micron would wind down Crucial, its consumer business, to focus on components for the AI industry. The PC I'm writing this article on has an SSD and RAM from Crucial. Overnight, Micron decided to end a business it spent decades building, and from a certain perspective, I guess it makes sense. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, creating unprecedented demand for server-grade solid-state storage and RAM. To meet the moment, manufacturers have been allocating more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin commercial customers. For consumers, the result has been skyrocketing RAM prices, with some DDR5 kits now costing as much as two or three times as much as they did a couple of months ago. Recent analysis from TrendForce shows the price of some consumer-grade SSDs increased between 20 and 60 percent in November for the same reason. Then there's LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA's Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin platforms. In 2026, it's expected to increase in price as well. The demand for AI infrastructure is such that all consumer electronics may cost more in the coming months.Price Changes Coming December 7th 2025, Due To Market Conditions 🔔‼️ pic.twitter.com/et0HADhc08— CyberPowerPC (@CYBERPOWERPC) November 25, 2025 That gets me to the purpose of this article. If you've been thinking about upgrading to a new graphics card, I would recommend you buy one sooner rather than later. The AI boom came for RAM first, and there are already signs it will come for GPU pricing next. A recent report suggests AMD is considering raising the MSRP of its 8GB models by $20 and 16GB models by $40 due to the price of GDDR6 memory. NVIDIA, meanwhile, is rumored to have recently told its board partners it would no longer supply them with VRAM for their cards. Neither NVIDIA nor AMD responded to comment requests from Engadget requesting they share how they plan to work with their board partners to ensure GPU prices remain stable. NVIDIA also did not comment on reports the company will stop providing VRAM to its board partners. Separate from the memory shortage, neither NVIDIA nor AMD are expected to release new GPUs soon. According to recent rumors, the earliest a Super refresh of the Blackwell line could arrive is sometime in the middle of 2026 — not at CES in January as the 40-series Super cards did in 2024. The memory crunch could complicate things there too, since the company has typically relied on more and faster VRAM to offer better performance on its Super cards. With 50-series Super GPUs, it might not be the case that NVIDIA announces them at the same MSRP as their non-Super predecessors, which was the case with the 40-series. As for AMD, the company debuted its RDNA 4 cards at the start of the year. We know it's already working on RDNA 5, and if a recent chat with Sony's Mark Cerny is any indication, the new architecture will be a major step change for AMD. However, right now rumors indicate the earliest RDNA 5 could arrive is sometime in 2027.In other words, with nothing new on the horizon and pricing of existing stock likely to increase, there might be only a short window where you can get a new GPU at a reasonable price. It's impossible to predict the future, but if you're in need of an upgrade and have the means to purchase, there might not be a better opportunity before the end of 2026. RecommendationsThe recommendations in Engadget's recent GPU guide are still as relevant today as they were a few months ago. Once again, the best advice I can give is to buy a card with at least 12GB of VRAM, and preferably 16GB if your budget allows for it. Unless you mostly plan to play older games on a 1080p monitor, it's not worth considering a model with 8GB of VRAM — it won't last you long enough to warrant the purchase price. Our recommendations are grouped from most affordable to most expensive. Where possible, I've tried to find options from both Newegg and Amazon. You won't find any high-end picks like the RTX 5080 since if you can afford that card, this guide isn't for you. Intel Arc B580Intel's Arc B580 is a great budget option, as long as you can put up with some driver issues. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor those on a tight budget, I would start and end my search with the Intel Arc B580. Newegg has models from ASRock and Onix at or under the card's $250 MSRP. I can't speak to the quality of ONIX cards, but ASRock is well-regarded. Over on Amazon, you can find the B580 for $300. With Intel cards you sometimes need to put up with odd driver issues, but as far as budget options go, the B580 offers value that's hard to beat. The one thing about budget cards like the B580 is they’re likely to face the most pricing pressure from the memory crunch due to the smaller margins manufacturers are making on them. NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti 16GBIf you decide to go with the RTX 5060 Ti, be sure to buy the 16GB model. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetIf you have more than $250 to spend on a GPU, the RTX 5060 Ti is the GPU to buy. Avoid the 8GB model and go straight for the 16GB variant. NVIDIA announced the 5060 Ti at an MSRP of $429, and luckily as of the writing of this article, you can still find one close to that price.Newegg, for instance, is selling the MSI Ventus Black Plus version of the card for $440. Amazon has the silver colorway of that same GPU listed for $460 currently. The retailer also has models from Gigabyte and Zotac in and around that same price. If I had to pick between the 5060 Ti and 5070, which NVIDIA only offers with 12GB of VRAM, I would pick the former. The 5060 Ti is a safer bet, and offers nearly as much performance, particularly in games that include ray tracing as an option. AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT If you're a fan of Team Red, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are among the best cards of this generation. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor a mid-range option, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT offer excellent value. Of the two cards, the 9070 is the better purchase for most people due to its less demanding power requirements, but if you got a PSU that can handle the 9070 XT, go for it. Right now, Newegg has a few 9070 models from ASRock and Sapphire just under the card's $549 MSRP. My friend recently bought the Sapphire card linked above, and has had nothing but good things to say about it. You'll pay more going through Amazon, but the company has a couple of options around $600 from XFX and Gigabyte. When it comes to the 9070 XT, Newegg has an ASRock model priced right at the card's $599 MSRP. Many of the other options from Sapphire and XFX are unfortunately priced between $650 and $700. The same is true on Amazon, where the cheapest model I could find was $630. NVIDIA RTX 5070 TiIf you have more money to spend, the RTX 5070 Ti is a performance beast. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor our final recommendation, consider the RTX 5070 Ti. It's a great option if you want to play games at 4K for less than what the 5080 and 5090 cost. Newegg has MSI and Zotac models on sale for $750, the card's recommended price. There are also a handful of other options from ASUS and Gigabyte that are just over $800. Amazon, meanwhile, is selling one Gigabyte variant for $749.

          "title": "Pebble&#8217;s founder introduces a $75 AI smart ring for recording brief notes with a press of a button",
          "standfirst": "Named for the finger where the ring is meant to be worn, the new $75 Index 01 ring is not meant to be a competitor to the always-on, always-listening AI devices, like the AI pendant Friend, but instead offers a way to record quick notes and reminders with a press of a button on the ring's side. AI only comes into play via the open source, speech-to-text, and AI models that run locally on your smartphone, via the open source Pebble mobile app. That is, if the Ring's button is not being pressed, it's not recording. (And this is a press-and-hold gesture, too, which means you can't start the ring's recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.) You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you would have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it's water-resistant to 1 meter. The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn't record details about your heart rate or health. And it's not there to be your AI friend. \"I'm not trying to build some AI assistant thing,\" Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. \"I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,\" he explains. \"I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain...that's what this is. It's always with you.\" Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. Migicovsky has been wearing the ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn't always have a memory device with him. \"The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don't write it down that second, I forget it,\" he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. \"The battery lasts for years,\" Migicovsky claims. Technically, the ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. At that rate, he'll get about two years of usage. When the ring's battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling. When using Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don't have your phone handy, but it wouldn't work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind. The ring also supports 99+ languages and has a bit of on-device memory, in case you're not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise). If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch's screen so you can verify it's correct. The ring works with Pebble's mobile app, which offers notes and reminders, but can optionally integrate with your phone's calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring's software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out. Because of its open nature, the ring's button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone's camera. You could use it to send a message through the universal chat app Beeper, which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via MCP. A new approach to hardware Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be difficult to get right -- as the previous exit of Pebble to Fitbit showed. (Fitbit, too, was later acquired by Google in 2021). \"I didn't earn any money during Pebble -- we exited, but it was not a great exit,\" Migicovsky admits. This year, however, he decided to reboot the Pebble project after Google open sourced the PebbleOS, which opened up the door to new hardware. With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. Still, the founder doesn't regret his previous choices, he clarifies. \"I wouldn't have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it's not the only way to build a company,\" he told TechCrunch. \" And, speaking as an ex-YC partner, there are -- there's a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that...I think what I'm doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,\" he says. The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability. So far, Core Devices has shipped the Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the Pebble Time 2. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 pre-orders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen. As for the Index 01, the ring's pre-order offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes and three colors.",
          "content": "Named for the finger where the ring is meant to be worn, the new $75 Index 01 ring is not meant to be a competitor to the always-on, always-listening AI devices, like the AI pendant Friend, but instead offers a way to record quick notes and reminders with a press of a button on the ring's side. AI only comes into play via the open source, speech-to-text, and AI models that run locally on your smartphone, via the open source Pebble mobile app. That is, if the Ring's button is not being pressed, it's not recording. (And this is a press-and-hold gesture, too, which means you can't start the ring's recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.) You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you would have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it's water-resistant to 1 meter. The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn't record details about your heart rate or health. And it's not there to be your AI friend. \"I'm not trying to build some AI assistant thing,\" Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. \"I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,\" he explains. \"I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain...that's what this is. It's always with you.\" Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. Migicovsky has been wearing the ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn't always have a memory device with him. \"The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don't write it down that second, I forget it,\" he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. \"The battery lasts for years,\" Migicovsky claims. Technically, the ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. At that rate, he'll get about two years of usage. When the ring's battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling. When using Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don't have your phone handy, but it wouldn't work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind. The ring also supports 99+ languages and has a bit of on-device memory, in case you're not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise). If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch's screen so you can verify it's correct. The ring works with Pebble's mobile app, which offers notes and reminders, but can optionally integrate with your phone's calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring's software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out. Because of its open nature, the ring's button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone's camera. You could use it to send a message through the universal chat app Beeper, which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via MCP. A new approach to hardware Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be difficult to get right -- as the previous exit of Pebble to Fitbit showed. (Fitbit, too, was later acquired by Google in 2021). \"I didn't earn any money during Pebble -- we exited, but it was not a great exit,\" Migicovsky admits. This year, however, he decided to reboot the Pebble project after Google open sourced the PebbleOS, which opened up the door to new hardware. With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. Still, the founder doesn't regret his previous choices, he clarifies. \"I wouldn't have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it's not the only way to build a company,\" he told TechCrunch. \" And, speaking as an ex-YC partner, there are -- there's a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that...I think what I'm doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,\" he says. The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability. So far, Core Devices has shipped the Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the Pebble Time 2. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 pre-orders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen. As for the Index 01, the ring's pre-order offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes and three colors.",

          "standfirst": "It’s the end of another year, so it’s time for the Engadget staff to compile a list of the year’s biggest losers. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made our lives worse over the course of the year. Some selections may be so pervasive they actually make our list of biggest winners. But, for the most part, we’re confident you’ll share in our collective rage over the biggest losers of 2025.OpenAIOpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivers a speech with video at the SK AI Summit 2025 at COEX in Seoul, South Korea on November 3, 2025 Anadolu via Getty ImagesIn 2025, OpenAI shed any pretense it was committed to anything more than making money. There are a few different things you could point to, including the company's successful reorganization into a more traditional profit-seeking business, but I think the most damning sign was OpenAI's response to the tragic death of Adam Raine. In August, Raine’s parents sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts by their son before it helped him successfully plan his death. At first, OpenAI's response appeared commensurate with the gravity of the situation. A week after news of the lawsuit broke, the company announced in early September it was working on parental controls. That same month, the company said it was working on a system that would automatically identify teen users and restrict their ChatGPT usage. Then came the announcement of a new \"wellness\" advisory council. Setting aside the question of whether OpenAI would even follow the advice of the council, it was peculiar that the company chose not recruit a single expert on suicide prevention. At that point, it was still possible to give OpenAI the benefit of the doubt, but then information about the company's legal defense against the Raines started to trickle out, including the fact it had reportedly asked to see the memorial guest list for Adam Raine's funeral, a request the family's lawyers described as \"intentional harassment.\" In late November, court documents revealed the company planned to argue Raine's \"misuse\" of ChatGPT was to blame for his death, not its own insufficient safety systems. We live in a world where tech giants are rarely held accountable for the great harm they've shown themselves capable of inflicting on people. As things stand, OpenAI's handling of Adam Raine's death is further proof something must change. — Igor Bonifacic, Senior reporterXboxAn Xbox Ally X running the Windows full screen experience.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetDid anything go right for Xbox this year? While price increases have also affected Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft cranked up the prices of both the Xbox Series S and X twice in the last year. It’s bad: The Series S is now $100 more than at launch, five years on.Previously “the best deal in gaming”, the Xbox Series X/S combined with a Game Pass subscription gave you a ton of games to play, including any of Microsoft’s own titles on their launch date. However, the subscription is now $30 a month, up 50 percent. (It was previously $17 per month the year before.)I agree with Nathan Ingraham’s take: $30 for literally hundreds of games, plus launch-day availability for major games that typically cost $70, is reasonable. But it’s still a harder sell when the price has jumped. Are you getting 50 percent more games? Not yet. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft demanded higher profits from Xbox back in 2023. When the gaming division reached around 12 percent growth in the first nine months of 2022, that was an ambitious goal. Day One launches on Game Pass apparently dented Xbox’s ability to pull profits from its biggest titles.Microsoft no longer shares console unit sales, but in its most recent earnings report, the company announced that hardware revenue dropped 29 percent. That’s including those price increases, meaning console sales fell even further.Estimates over the last few years put the PS5 tens of millions of units ahead. An annual subscription to Game Pass is more than double the Sony console’s most premium plan, although it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. This year, Microsoft collaborated with ASUS to create Xbox-branded handheld gaming PCs. In that form-factor, I was on the precipice of grabbing Game Pass and barreling through Xbox titles I never had the chance to play. Then, I reassessed exactly what I was missing out on. It wasn’t the inclusion of a Fortnite Crew subscription. Despite its developer shopping spree, Xbox exclusives remain few, with many appearing on rival platforms. This year, Indiana Jones and even the Forza series is available to play on PlayStation. And next year? Halo. Where are the exciting new games going to come from? In the middle of 2025, Microsoft announced major layoffs affecting over 9,000 employees across the company. with the gaming division being hit exceptionally hard. Cuts and closures across many of Microsoft’s game studios led to cancellations like a Perfect Dark reboot and Rare’s Everwild.Xbox’s 2025 was bad on both the business and creative fronts. The decision to hike console and Game Pass prices didn’t immediately turn around revenue. At the same time, layoffs and high-profile game cancellations make Xbox a challenging pitch for anyone deciding which console or platform to invest in. Right now, looking at Engadget’s pick of the top Xbox games, the only game I feel like I’m missing out on is Avowed. Many of our favorite games are already available on PS5 and several can be played on the Switch. The reverse, however, isn’t true. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefGrokThe Grokipedia page about Elon Musk Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesIt's hard to even know where to begin. X users have long noticed that Grok, the site's built-in chatbot, is less filtered than other AI tools. But this year, Grok went off the rails in some truly unhinged and disturbing ways. There was the time Grok randomly began talking about a nonexistent \"white genocide\" in South Africa in response to completely unrelated questions. There was the time it declared itself \"MechaHitler,\" much to the delight of neo-nazi fanboys on X. There was the time it was caught posting Holocaust denial tropes, and the time researchers noted its Wikipedia knockoff that contains dozens of citations of neo-Nazi website Stormfront. There was the time it became so embarrassingly obsessed with Elon Musk it claimed he was a better basketball player than LeBron James and a better actor than Tom Cruise. It later brought both its anti-semitism and Musk sycophancy together when it stated that it would choose saving Musk's brain over saving 16 million Jews. \"His potential long-term impact on billions outweighs the loss in utilitarian terms,\" it stated in a post that's since been deleted. Besides the horrifying racism, what all of these incidents have in common is that xAI, Musk's AI company that acquired X earlier this year, has failed to fully explain how its chatbot went so far off the rails. The company has blamed an unnamed rogue employee, its own Nazi-loving users and \"adversarial prompting\" for Grok's missteps. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterEVs in the USFord Mustang Mach-E vehicles are seen for sale on a dealership lot on June 24, 2025 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell via Getty ImagesEVs sales across the globe are up around 25 percent this year. Germany broke records in the first half of 2025, with electric cars accounting for nearly one in five new registrations. Meanwhile, back in September, sales of BEVs in the UK grew by almost a third, setting a new high for our neighbors across the pond. And in China, EV sales are growing so fast (over 50 percent market share) that the country is beginning to flood the global market with gas-powered cars that it can't sell at home. So naturally, what did our esteemed leaders in the US do in order to help companies here stay competitive? They ended the EV tax credit. And wouldn't you know it, after a spike earlier this fall just before the credit went away, sales of EVs in the US began to slump, with some automakers like Ford seeing a drop of 60 percent year-over-year. No matter how you slice it, this is bad for any company that sells EVs in the US and particularly bad for anyone considering purchasing a new one in the foreseeable future. As an EV owner, that just bums me out. Not only does this policy change put more roadblocks in the way of making battery-powered cars more affordable, it also puts a damper on EV investment and threatens to cause US automakers to fall even further behind their rivals in China and elsewhere. Manufacturers across the Pacific are going so wild, they are making EVs that can jump like the Mach 5 from Speed Racer. That isn't to say there aren't any promising developments on the horizon. Ford's Universal EV Platform and the arrival of the Rivian R2 sometime next year are a couple of examples. But it's clear that our politicians wanted to target EVs in the US this year and they sure made it happen. So the next time someone asks why we can't have nice things here, you know who to blame. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterDJI drone customersDJI Neo 2Steve Dent for EngadgetBarring a miracle, DJI will be banned from selling any new drones in the US starting December 23rd — and buyers will feel the pain. As I wrote last month, the company has been targeted by regulators since 2017 over concerns that its products could be used to spy on sensitive US infrastructure on behalf of China. “What’s the big deal?” you may ask. “Surely people can buy from other drone companies.” Indeed, but the problem is that DJI has such a monumental technological lead and high market share (over 75 percent) that its absence will effectively upend the industry. Commercial buyers have checked other (approved) options from the likes of Skydio, but found them wanting. “In one year and a half, we had five failures of the manufacturers on the list. DJI, none,” Orlando police Sgt. David Cruz told the Miami Herald. “I work for a popular UAV photogrammetry company,” said a user on Reddit. “[A] ban will set back the drone industry in the US by several years. There’s no competitor to DJI right now.”The same applies on the consumer side. DJI’s drones outperform rivals in nearly every area including range, battery life, subject tracking, obstacle detection and video quality. It’s so one-sided that when testing DJI drones, I struggle to find other options for buyers with anywhere close to the same capabilities. The US government does have reason to be concerned about DJI’s drones. They present an obvious national security risk due to their ability to fly over sensitive areas, take photos or video and transmit them, live, to any location in the world. And being a Chinese company, they’re compelled by law to cooperate with state intelligence services. However, the US government hasn’t attempted to work with DJI to determine whether its products pose a risk so far. DJI made a final plea for a security review recently by sending letters to five US agencies that could assess its products. If that fails, chaos among drone users is likely to ensue. “We just want the best technology that keeps our citizens safe for the most reasonable price,” Sgt. Drew Fennelly of the Lawrence, Kansas police department told The Wall Street Journal last year. “The technology in the US-made drones has not caught up with the Chinese-manufactured drones.” — Steve Dent, Contributing reporterTV streamingParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty ImagesIn 2015, Sling TV arrived with ESPN, CNN, TBS, HGTV, Disney Channel and others for just $20 a month. A couple years later, YouTube TV debuted for just $35 monthly and showed local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations plus dozens of other channels including ESPN, Fox Sports 1 and Bravo. Streaming TV had arrived. It was here to unfetter TV watchers from cable’s onerous contracts, high prices and carrier monopolies. Take that, Comcast! In your face, Charter! (But they’d still like to pay you for internet access, please.) Fast forward to 2025: Streaming TV and its low-price, monopoly-free, contractless freedom is all but dead. Every major live TV service provider raised prices this year. Currently, YouTubeTV, Hulu+ Live TV, Fubo and DirecTV all go for a minimum of $83 per month. That’s before you opt for cable-inspired package upgrades and channel add-ons. Throw in perks like 4K, additional sports channels and a couple of one-off networks and you’re easily shelling out $150 every month. You’ll pay less for chopped-up live TV plans from Sling TV, but be prepared to create a spreadsheet to make sure a plan has the channels you want. This year, consolidation came for TV streaming, giving strong Cox/Charter/Comcast monopoly vibes. Disney, which completed its buyout of Hulu in 2023, acquired Fubo this year and plans to combine the two. The combo makes Disney the second-largest live TV streaming provider behind Google. DirecTV already owns Sling TV, so that leaves just three big players in the live TV streaming arena. With Netflix's move to buy Warner Bros, the traditional streaming market is getting narrower, too. We can safely assume good ol’ market competition won’t be bringing prices down anytime soon. But it’s not just consolidation — fragmentation also contributes to an overall crappier streaming experience. In 2025, Disney launched a standalone ESPN service (no, not that one, nor that one) for $30 per month. So far, that doesn’t mean you can’t find ESPN content through other providers. But we did see Disney flex its increasingly large TV muscles in drawn-out contract negotiations with Google. The dispute darkened ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels on YouTube TV for two weeks this fall — which, I’ll point out for the cynical crowd, was less than two months after the standalone service launched. YouTube TV subscribers got a $20 credit, but that probably didn’t placate NFL and NCAA football fans who missed out on ESPN-carried games. Then in November, Fubo quarreled with NBCUniversal, saying the Peacock parent was “shifting content to their own streaming services” and forcing up rates. The spat turned off NBC, Bravo, USA and other channels for Fubo subscribers, no doubt infuriating both NBA and Real Housewives fans, despite a $15 credit. Of course, Fubo is Disney’s newest affiliate, so there are no non-bad guys here.The only advantage TV streaming has in its favor is the lack of cable-style contracts and I haven’t heard any murmurs of such a thing forthcoming. We are still all free to hop around between the big three TV streamers until we give up and just go back to DVDs. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterThe work of DOGEElon Musk at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the National Harbor in Oxon Hill, MD on February 20, 2025. The Washington Post via Getty ImagesAn Elon Musk-led attempt to rein in federal spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been a failure by almost every metric. As of November, it was reported that DOGE is no more, even though the initiative ostensibly had eight months left to run. An official told Reuters that DOGE \"doesn't exist,\" and it never should have in the first place.Though Musk was only at the helm of DOGE for a few months, he and his team caused chaos. Adopting the slash-and-burn tactic Musk employed when he took over Twitter, he swung a chainsaw through myriad government departments, with DOGE firing workers who were actually essential and quickly had to be hired back. By August, the government was said to have fired some 300,000 federal workers, with DOGE taking responsibility for most of those. Among other things, cuts at the National Institutes of Health resulted in the end of funding for hundreds of medical studies, which is said to have affected tens of thousands of patients. It's also estimated that the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development had resulted in more than 650,000 deaths around the world by early December, with children accounting for two-thirds of those. DOGE workers seemed to be busy, though. They reportedly monitored government communications for criticisms of both Musk and President Donald Trump, while implementing generative AI chatbots in an attempt to automate some government tasks. But for all the blustering about making the government much more efficient, DOGE did not meet its stated goal.Musk initially promised to reduce government spending by $2 trillion, but it didn't take long for him to reduce that pledge to $150 billion. And yet government spending has actually gone up. In October, the first month of the government's fiscal year, its total outlay was $689 billion, an increase of $105 billion (18 percent) from October 2024. Still, maybe DOGE wasn't a total disaster for its architects. It was able to gain access to sensitive and valuable government data, after all. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterAI videoSora 2 app launch screen displayed on smartphoneIn our post-truth world, video was one of the few remaining ways to prove something had actually happened. It had its problems of course, but the fact it was harder to fake than words and images, and anyone could record a clip with their phone, made it vital to our sense of shared reality. Think about the murder of George Floyd: The grave injustice of his death would have probably never come to light if Darnella Frazier had not filmed what happened. With the advent of AI video, I'm not sure where we go. Both Google and OpenAI pushed the technology into the realm of uncomfortable realism this year, but it's Sora's cameo feature that has me worried. Within the first week of the app's public availability, people were using the feature, which allows users to add the likeness of other people to their videos, to generate clips of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stealing GPUs from Target. Cameo has limitations, and users can restrict and delete videos that include their likeness, but it's just another assault on the truth. It's hard to see how making it trivial to create deepfake videos benefits anyone other than the companies offering building the tech. — I.B.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-losers-of-2025-140000419.html?src=rss",
          "content": "It’s the end of another year, so it’s time for the Engadget staff to compile a list of the year’s biggest losers. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made our lives worse over the course of the year. Some selections may be so pervasive they actually make our list of biggest winners. But, for the most part, we’re confident you’ll share in our collective rage over the biggest losers of 2025.OpenAIOpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivers a speech with video at the SK AI Summit 2025 at COEX in Seoul, South Korea on November 3, 2025 Anadolu via Getty ImagesIn 2025, OpenAI shed any pretense it was committed to anything more than making money. There are a few different things you could point to, including the company's successful reorganization into a more traditional profit-seeking business, but I think the most damning sign was OpenAI's response to the tragic death of Adam Raine. In August, Raine’s parents sued OpenAI, alleging ChatGPT was aware of four suicide attempts by their son before it helped him successfully plan his death. At first, OpenAI's response appeared commensurate with the gravity of the situation. A week after news of the lawsuit broke, the company announced in early September it was working on parental controls. That same month, the company said it was working on a system that would automatically identify teen users and restrict their ChatGPT usage. Then came the announcement of a new \"wellness\" advisory council. Setting aside the question of whether OpenAI would even follow the advice of the council, it was peculiar that the company chose not recruit a single expert on suicide prevention. At that point, it was still possible to give OpenAI the benefit of the doubt, but then information about the company's legal defense against the Raines started to trickle out, including the fact it had reportedly asked to see the memorial guest list for Adam Raine's funeral, a request the family's lawyers described as \"intentional harassment.\" In late November, court documents revealed the company planned to argue Raine's \"misuse\" of ChatGPT was to blame for his death, not its own insufficient safety systems. We live in a world where tech giants are rarely held accountable for the great harm they've shown themselves capable of inflicting on people. As things stand, OpenAI's handling of Adam Raine's death is further proof something must change. — Igor Bonifacic, Senior reporterXboxAn Xbox Ally X running the Windows full screen experience.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetDid anything go right for Xbox this year? While price increases have also affected Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft cranked up the prices of both the Xbox Series S and X twice in the last year. It’s bad: The Series S is now $100 more than at launch, five years on.Previously “the best deal in gaming”, the Xbox Series X/S combined with a Game Pass subscription gave you a ton of games to play, including any of Microsoft’s own titles on their launch date. However, the subscription is now $30 a month, up 50 percent. (It was previously $17 per month the year before.)I agree with Nathan Ingraham’s take: $30 for literally hundreds of games, plus launch-day availability for major games that typically cost $70, is reasonable. But it’s still a harder sell when the price has jumped. Are you getting 50 percent more games? Not yet. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft demanded higher profits from Xbox back in 2023. When the gaming division reached around 12 percent growth in the first nine months of 2022, that was an ambitious goal. Day One launches on Game Pass apparently dented Xbox’s ability to pull profits from its biggest titles.Microsoft no longer shares console unit sales, but in its most recent earnings report, the company announced that hardware revenue dropped 29 percent. That’s including those price increases, meaning console sales fell even further.Estimates over the last few years put the PS5 tens of millions of units ahead. An annual subscription to Game Pass is more than double the Sony console’s most premium plan, although it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. This year, Microsoft collaborated with ASUS to create Xbox-branded handheld gaming PCs. In that form-factor, I was on the precipice of grabbing Game Pass and barreling through Xbox titles I never had the chance to play. Then, I reassessed exactly what I was missing out on. It wasn’t the inclusion of a Fortnite Crew subscription. Despite its developer shopping spree, Xbox exclusives remain few, with many appearing on rival platforms. This year, Indiana Jones and even the Forza series is available to play on PlayStation. And next year? Halo. Where are the exciting new games going to come from? In the middle of 2025, Microsoft announced major layoffs affecting over 9,000 employees across the company. with the gaming division being hit exceptionally hard. Cuts and closures across many of Microsoft’s game studios led to cancellations like a Perfect Dark reboot and Rare’s Everwild.Xbox’s 2025 was bad on both the business and creative fronts. The decision to hike console and Game Pass prices didn’t immediately turn around revenue. At the same time, layoffs and high-profile game cancellations make Xbox a challenging pitch for anyone deciding which console or platform to invest in. Right now, looking at Engadget’s pick of the top Xbox games, the only game I feel like I’m missing out on is Avowed. Many of our favorite games are already available on PS5 and several can be played on the Switch. The reverse, however, isn’t true. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefGrokThe Grokipedia page about Elon Musk Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesIt's hard to even know where to begin. X users have long noticed that Grok, the site's built-in chatbot, is less filtered than other AI tools. But this year, Grok went off the rails in some truly unhinged and disturbing ways. There was the time Grok randomly began talking about a nonexistent \"white genocide\" in South Africa in response to completely unrelated questions. There was the time it declared itself \"MechaHitler,\" much to the delight of neo-nazi fanboys on X. There was the time it was caught posting Holocaust denial tropes, and the time researchers noted its Wikipedia knockoff that contains dozens of citations of neo-Nazi website Stormfront. There was the time it became so embarrassingly obsessed with Elon Musk it claimed he was a better basketball player than LeBron James and a better actor than Tom Cruise. It later brought both its anti-semitism and Musk sycophancy together when it stated that it would choose saving Musk's brain over saving 16 million Jews. \"His potential long-term impact on billions outweighs the loss in utilitarian terms,\" it stated in a post that's since been deleted. Besides the horrifying racism, what all of these incidents have in common is that xAI, Musk's AI company that acquired X earlier this year, has failed to fully explain how its chatbot went so far off the rails. The company has blamed an unnamed rogue employee, its own Nazi-loving users and \"adversarial prompting\" for Grok's missteps. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterEVs in the USFord Mustang Mach-E vehicles are seen for sale on a dealership lot on June 24, 2025 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell via Getty ImagesEVs sales across the globe are up around 25 percent this year. Germany broke records in the first half of 2025, with electric cars accounting for nearly one in five new registrations. Meanwhile, back in September, sales of BEVs in the UK grew by almost a third, setting a new high for our neighbors across the pond. And in China, EV sales are growing so fast (over 50 percent market share) that the country is beginning to flood the global market with gas-powered cars that it can't sell at home. So naturally, what did our esteemed leaders in the US do in order to help companies here stay competitive? They ended the EV tax credit. And wouldn't you know it, after a spike earlier this fall just before the credit went away, sales of EVs in the US began to slump, with some automakers like Ford seeing a drop of 60 percent year-over-year. No matter how you slice it, this is bad for any company that sells EVs in the US and particularly bad for anyone considering purchasing a new one in the foreseeable future. As an EV owner, that just bums me out. Not only does this policy change put more roadblocks in the way of making battery-powered cars more affordable, it also puts a damper on EV investment and threatens to cause US automakers to fall even further behind their rivals in China and elsewhere. Manufacturers across the Pacific are going so wild, they are making EVs that can jump like the Mach 5 from Speed Racer. That isn't to say there aren't any promising developments on the horizon. Ford's Universal EV Platform and the arrival of the Rivian R2 sometime next year are a couple of examples. But it's clear that our politicians wanted to target EVs in the US this year and they sure made it happen. So the next time someone asks why we can't have nice things here, you know who to blame. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterDJI drone customersDJI Neo 2Steve Dent for EngadgetBarring a miracle, DJI will be banned from selling any new drones in the US starting December 23rd — and buyers will feel the pain. As I wrote last month, the company has been targeted by regulators since 2017 over concerns that its products could be used to spy on sensitive US infrastructure on behalf of China. “What’s the big deal?” you may ask. “Surely people can buy from other drone companies.” Indeed, but the problem is that DJI has such a monumental technological lead and high market share (over 75 percent) that its absence will effectively upend the industry. Commercial buyers have checked other (approved) options from the likes of Skydio, but found them wanting. “In one year and a half, we had five failures of the manufacturers on the list. DJI, none,” Orlando police Sgt. David Cruz told the Miami Herald. “I work for a popular UAV photogrammetry company,” said a user on Reddit. “[A] ban will set back the drone industry in the US by several years. There’s no competitor to DJI right now.”The same applies on the consumer side. DJI’s drones outperform rivals in nearly every area including range, battery life, subject tracking, obstacle detection and video quality. It’s so one-sided that when testing DJI drones, I struggle to find other options for buyers with anywhere close to the same capabilities. The US government does have reason to be concerned about DJI’s drones. They present an obvious national security risk due to their ability to fly over sensitive areas, take photos or video and transmit them, live, to any location in the world. And being a Chinese company, they’re compelled by law to cooperate with state intelligence services. However, the US government hasn’t attempted to work with DJI to determine whether its products pose a risk so far. DJI made a final plea for a security review recently by sending letters to five US agencies that could assess its products. If that fails, chaos among drone users is likely to ensue. “We just want the best technology that keeps our citizens safe for the most reasonable price,” Sgt. Drew Fennelly of the Lawrence, Kansas police department told The Wall Street Journal last year. “The technology in the US-made drones has not caught up with the Chinese-manufactured drones.” — Steve Dent, Contributing reporterTV streamingParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty ImagesIn 2015, Sling TV arrived with ESPN, CNN, TBS, HGTV, Disney Channel and others for just $20 a month. A couple years later, YouTube TV debuted for just $35 monthly and showed local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations plus dozens of other channels including ESPN, Fox Sports 1 and Bravo. Streaming TV had arrived. It was here to unfetter TV watchers from cable’s onerous contracts, high prices and carrier monopolies. Take that, Comcast! In your face, Charter! (But they’d still like to pay you for internet access, please.) Fast forward to 2025: Streaming TV and its low-price, monopoly-free, contractless freedom is all but dead. Every major live TV service provider raised prices this year. Currently, YouTubeTV, Hulu+ Live TV, Fubo and DirecTV all go for a minimum of $83 per month. That’s before you opt for cable-inspired package upgrades and channel add-ons. Throw in perks like 4K, additional sports channels and a couple of one-off networks and you’re easily shelling out $150 every month. You’ll pay less for chopped-up live TV plans from Sling TV, but be prepared to create a spreadsheet to make sure a plan has the channels you want. This year, consolidation came for TV streaming, giving strong Cox/Charter/Comcast monopoly vibes. Disney, which completed its buyout of Hulu in 2023, acquired Fubo this year and plans to combine the two. The combo makes Disney the second-largest live TV streaming provider behind Google. DirecTV already owns Sling TV, so that leaves just three big players in the live TV streaming arena. With Netflix's move to buy Warner Bros, the traditional streaming market is getting narrower, too. We can safely assume good ol’ market competition won’t be bringing prices down anytime soon. But it’s not just consolidation — fragmentation also contributes to an overall crappier streaming experience. In 2025, Disney launched a standalone ESPN service (no, not that one, nor that one) for $30 per month. So far, that doesn’t mean you can’t find ESPN content through other providers. But we did see Disney flex its increasingly large TV muscles in drawn-out contract negotiations with Google. The dispute darkened ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels on YouTube TV for two weeks this fall — which, I’ll point out for the cynical crowd, was less than two months after the standalone service launched. YouTube TV subscribers got a $20 credit, but that probably didn’t placate NFL and NCAA football fans who missed out on ESPN-carried games. Then in November, Fubo quarreled with NBCUniversal, saying the Peacock parent was “shifting content to their own streaming services” and forcing up rates. The spat turned off NBC, Bravo, USA and other channels for Fubo subscribers, no doubt infuriating both NBA and Real Housewives fans, despite a $15 credit. Of course, Fubo is Disney’s newest affiliate, so there are no non-bad guys here.The only advantage TV streaming has in its favor is the lack of cable-style contracts and I haven’t heard any murmurs of such a thing forthcoming. We are still all free to hop around between the big three TV streamers until we give up and just go back to DVDs. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterThe work of DOGEElon Musk at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the National Harbor in Oxon Hill, MD on February 20, 2025. The Washington Post via Getty ImagesAn Elon Musk-led attempt to rein in federal spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been a failure by almost every metric. As of November, it was reported that DOGE is no more, even though the initiative ostensibly had eight months left to run. An official told Reuters that DOGE \"doesn't exist,\" and it never should have in the first place.Though Musk was only at the helm of DOGE for a few months, he and his team caused chaos. Adopting the slash-and-burn tactic Musk employed when he took over Twitter, he swung a chainsaw through myriad government departments, with DOGE firing workers who were actually essential and quickly had to be hired back. By August, the government was said to have fired some 300,000 federal workers, with DOGE taking responsibility for most of those. Among other things, cuts at the National Institutes of Health resulted in the end of funding for hundreds of medical studies, which is said to have affected tens of thousands of patients. It's also estimated that the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development had resulted in more than 650,000 deaths around the world by early December, with children accounting for two-thirds of those. DOGE workers seemed to be busy, though. They reportedly monitored government communications for criticisms of both Musk and President Donald Trump, while implementing generative AI chatbots in an attempt to automate some government tasks. But for all the blustering about making the government much more efficient, DOGE did not meet its stated goal.Musk initially promised to reduce government spending by $2 trillion, but it didn't take long for him to reduce that pledge to $150 billion. And yet government spending has actually gone up. In October, the first month of the government's fiscal year, its total outlay was $689 billion, an increase of $105 billion (18 percent) from October 2024. Still, maybe DOGE wasn't a total disaster for its architects. It was able to gain access to sensitive and valuable government data, after all. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterAI videoSora 2 app launch screen displayed on smartphoneIn our post-truth world, video was one of the few remaining ways to prove something had actually happened. It had its problems of course, but the fact it was harder to fake than words and images, and anyone could record a clip with their phone, made it vital to our sense of shared reality. Think about the murder of George Floyd: The grave injustice of his death would have probably never come to light if Darnella Frazier had not filmed what happened. With the advent of AI video, I'm not sure where we go. Both Google and OpenAI pushed the technology into the realm of uncomfortable realism this year, but it's Sora's cameo feature that has me worried. Within the first week of the app's public availability, people were using the feature, which allows users to add the likeness of other people to their videos, to generate clips of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stealing GPUs from Target.

          "standfirst": "NVIDIA is now allowed to sell its second-best H200 processors to China, rather than just the sanction-approved H20 model that China had previously declined to buy, President Trump wrote on Truth Social. The United States will collect a 25 percent tariff on those sales, the Commerce Department confirmed yesterday. Trump said that he informed China's President Xi Jinping of the decision and that he \"responded positively.\" The Commerce Department is finalizing details and the administration will take the same approach with AMD, Intel and other US companies. He added that the administration would \"protect National Security,\" so the latest Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chips are not part of the deal. The 25 percent tariff would be higher than the 15 percent the White House suggested in August. Though the administration won't allow NVIDIA to send its latest high-end chips, it was reportedly concerned that the company would lose business to Huawei if it was completely shut out of China's market, according to Reuters. No details about the number of H200 chips or which companies would be eligible to buy them were released. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,\" NVIDIA said in a statement. The decision is not without controversy, though. Several Democratic US senators called it a \"colossal economic and national security failure\" that will aid China's industry and military. Republican representative John Mollenaar put it in even starker terms. \"NVIDIA should be under no illusions — China will rip off its technology, mass-produce it themselves and seek to end NVIDIA as a competitor,\" he said. Despite the current restriction on Blackwell B200 processors, $1 billion worth of those and other high-end NVIDIA chips have made their way to China via black market sales, according to previous reports. That model, along with the H100 and H200, is far more capable than the H20 chip, which was designed to comply with export restrictions for sale to China. NVIDIA has said that the B200 chip is almost ten times faster than the H200 for some jobs, and the H200 is six times faster than the H20. Washington's approval doesn't mean that China will purchase NVIDIA's chips, as Beijing has previously told companies not to use US technology. Huawei is currently the most advanced company in that regard and recently unveiled a three-year plan to catch up with NVIDIA and AMD. However, AI chip experts like Richard Windsor have said NVIDIA's tech is still far ahead of anything that Huawei or other Chinese companies can currently produce.

          "title": "The year age verification laws came for the open internet",
          "standfirst": "When the nonprofit Freedom House recently published its annual report, it noted that 2025 marked the 15th straight year of decline for global internet freedom. The biggest decline, after Georgia and Germany, came within the United States.Among the culprits cited in the report: age verification laws, dozens of which have come into effect over the last year. \"Online anonymity, an essential enabler for freedom of expression, is entering a period of crisis as policymakers in free and autocratic countries alike mandate the use of identity verification technology for certain websites or platforms, motivated in some cases by the legitimate aim of protecting children,\" the report warns.Age verification laws are, in some ways, part of a years-long reckoning over child safety online, as tech companies have shown themselves unable to prevent serious harms to their most vulnerable users. Lawmakers, who have failed to pass data privacy regulations, Section 230 reform or any other meaningful legislation that would thoughtfully reimagine what responsibilities tech companies owe their users, have instead turned to the blunt tool of age-based restrictions — and with much greater success. Over the last two years, 25 states have passed laws requiring some kind of age verification to access adult content online. This year, the Supreme Court delivered a major victory to backers of age verification standards when it upheld a Texas law requiring sites hosting adult content to check the ages of their users.Age checks have also expanded to social media and online platforms more broadly. Sixteen states now have laws requiring parental controls or other age-based restrictions for social media services. (Six of these measures are currently in limbo due to court challenges.) A federal bill to ban kids younger than 13 from social media has gained bipartisan support in Congress. Utah, Texas and Louisiana passed laws requiring app stores to check the ages of their users, all of which are set to go into effect next year. California plans to enact age-based rules for app stores in 2027.These laws have started to fragment the internet. Smaller platforms and websites that don't have the resources to pay for third-party verification services may have no choice but to exit markets where age checks are required. Blogging service Dreamwidth pulled out of Mississippi after its age verification laws went into effect, saying that the $10,000 per user fines it could face were an \"existential threat\" to the company. Bluesky also opted to go dark in Mississippi rather than comply. (The service has complied with age verification laws in South Dakota and Wyoming, as well as the UK.) Pornhub, which has called existing age verification laws \"haphazard and dangerous,\" has blocked access in 23 states. Pornhub is not an outlier in its assessment. Privacy advocates have long warned that age verification laws put everyone's privacy at risk. Practically, there's no way to limit age verification standards only to minors. Confirming the ages of everyone under 18 means you have to confirm the ages of everyone. In practice, this often means submitting a government-issued ID or allowing an app to scan your face. Both are problematic and we don't need to look far to see how these methods can go wrong. Discord recently revealed that around 70,000 users \"may\" have had their government IDs leaked due to an \"incident\" involving a third-party vendor the company contracts with to provide customer service related to age verification. Last year, another third-party identity provider that had worked with TikTok, Uber and other services exposed drivers' licenses. As a growing number of platforms require us to hand over an ID, these kinds of incidents will likely become even more common. Similar risks exist for face scans. Because most minors don't have official IDs, platforms often rely on AI-based tools that can guess users' ages. A face scan may seem more private than handing over a social security number, but we could be turning over far more information than we realize, according to experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\"When we submit to a face scan to estimate our age, a less scrupulous company could flip a switch and use the same face scan, plus a slightly different algorithm, to guess our name or other demographics,\" the organization notes. \"A poorly designed system might store this personal data, and even correlate it to the online content that we look at. In the hands of an adversary, and cross-referenced to other readily available information, this information can expose intimate details about us.\"These issues aren't limited to the United States. Australia, Denmark and Malaysia have taken steps to ban younger teens from social media entirely. Officials in France are pushing for a similar ban, as well as a \"curfew\" for older teens. These measures would also necessitate some form of age verification in order to block the intended users. In the UK, where the Online Safety Act went into effect earlier this year, we've already seen how well-intentioned efforts to protect teens from supposedly harmful content can end up making large swaths of the internet more difficult to access. The law is ostensibly meant to \"prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography,\" according to the BBC. But the law has also resulted in age checks that reach far beyond porn sites. Age verification is required to access music on Spotify. It will soon be required for Xbox accounts. On X, videos of protests have been blocked. Redditors have reported being blocked from a lengthy number of subreddits that are marked NSFW but don't actually host porn, including those related to menstruation, news and addiction recovery. Wikipedia, which recently lost a challenge to be excluded from the law's strictest requirements, is facing the prospect of being forced to verify the ages of its UK contributors, which the organization has said could have disastrous consequences. The UK law has also shown how ineffective existing age verification methods are. Users have been able to circumvent the checks by using selfies of video game characters, AI-generated images of ID documents and, of course, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As the EFF notes, VPNs are incredibly widely used. The software allows people to browse the internet while masking their actual location. They're used by activists and students and people who want to get around geoblocks built into streaming services. Many universities and businesses (including Engadget parent company Yahoo) require their students and workers to use VPNs in order to access certain information. Blocking VPNs would have serious repercussions for all of these groups. The makers of several popular VPN services reported major spikes in the UK following the Online Safety Act going into effect this summer, with ProtonVPN reporting a 1,400 percent surge in sign-ups. That's also led to fears of a renewed crackdown on VPNs. Ofcom, the regulator tasked with enforcing the law, told TechRadar it was \"monitoring\" VPN usage, which has further fueled speculation it could try to ban or restrict their use. And here in the States, lawmakers in Wisconsin have proposed an age verification law that would require sites that host \"harmful\" content to also block VPNs.While restrictions on VPNs are, for now, mostly theoretical, the fact that such measures are even being considered is alarming. Up to now, VPN bans are more closely associated with authoritarian countries without an open internet, like Russia and China. If we continue down a path of trying to put age gates up around every piece of potentially objectionable content, the internet could get a lot worse for everyone.

The biggest decline, after Georgia and Germany, came within the United States.Among the culprits cited in the report: age verification laws, dozens of which have come into effect over the last year. \"Online anonymity, an essential enabler for freedom of expression, is entering a period of crisis as policymakers in free and autocratic countries alike mandate the use of identity verification technology for certain websites or platforms, motivated in some cases by the legitimate aim of protecting children,\" the report warns.Age verification laws are, in some ways, part of a years-long reckoning over child safety online, as tech companies have shown themselves unable to prevent serious harms to their most vulnerable users. Lawmakers, who have failed to pass data privacy regulations, Section 230 reform or any other meaningful legislation that would thoughtfully reimagine what responsibilities tech companies owe their users, have instead turned to the blunt tool of age-based restrictions — and with much greater success. Over the last two years, 25 states have passed laws requiring some kind of age verification to access adult content online. This year, the Supreme Court delivered a major victory to backers of age verification standards when it upheld a Texas law requiring sites hosting adult content to check the ages of their users.Age checks have also expanded to social media and online platforms more broadly. Sixteen states now have laws requiring parental controls or other age-based restrictions for social media services. (Six of these measures are currently in limbo due to court challenges.) A federal bill to ban kids younger than 13 from social media has gained bipartisan support in Congress. Utah, Texas and Louisiana passed laws requiring app stores to check the ages of their users, all of which are set to go into effect next year. California plans to enact age-based rules for app stores in 2027.These laws have started to fragment the internet. Smaller platforms and websites that don't have the resources to pay for third-party verification services may have no choice but to exit markets where age checks are required. Blogging service Dreamwidth pulled out of Mississippi after its age verification laws went into effect, saying that the $10,000 per user fines it could face were an \"existential threat\" to the company. Bluesky also opted to go dark in Mississippi rather than comply. (The service has complied with age verification laws in South Dakota and Wyoming, as well as the UK.) Pornhub, which has called existing age verification laws \"haphazard and dangerous,\" has blocked access in 23 states. Pornhub is not an outlier in its assessment. Privacy advocates have long warned that age verification laws put everyone's privacy at risk. Practically, there's no way to limit age verification standards only to minors. Confirming the ages of everyone under 18 means you have to confirm the ages of everyone. In practice, this often means submitting a government-issued ID or allowing an app to scan your face. Both are problematic and we don't need to look far to see how these methods can go wrong. Discord recently revealed that around 70,000 users \"may\" have had their government IDs leaked due to an \"incident\" involving a third-party vendor the company contracts with to provide customer service related to age verification. Last year, another third-party identity provider that had worked with TikTok, Uber and other services exposed drivers' licenses. As a growing number of platforms require us to hand over an ID, these kinds of incidents will likely become even more common. Similar risks exist for face scans. Because most minors don't have official IDs, platforms often rely on AI-based tools that can guess users' ages. A face scan may seem more private than handing over a social security number, but we could be turning over far more information than we realize, according to experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\"When we submit to a face scan to estimate our age, a less scrupulous company could flip a switch and use the same face scan, plus a slightly different algorithm, to guess our name or other demographics,\" the organization notes. \"A poorly designed system might store this personal data, and even correlate it to the online content that we look at. In the hands of an adversary, and cross-referenced to other readily available information, this information can expose intimate details about us.\"These issues aren't limited to the United States. Australia, Denmark and Malaysia have taken steps to ban younger teens from social media entirely. Officials in France are pushing for a similar ban, as well as a \"curfew\" for older teens. These measures would also necessitate some form of age verification in order to block the intended users. In the UK, where the Online Safety Act went into effect earlier this year, we've already seen how well-intentioned efforts to protect teens from supposedly harmful content can end up making large swaths of the internet more difficult to access. The law is ostensibly meant to \"prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography,\" according to the BBC. But the law has also resulted in age checks that reach far beyond porn sites. Age verification is required to access music on Spotify. It will soon be required for Xbox accounts. On X, videos of protests have been blocked. Redditors have reported being blocked from a lengthy number of subreddits that are marked NSFW but don't actually host porn, including those related to menstruation, news and addiction recovery. Wikipedia, which recently lost a challenge to be excluded from the law's strictest requirements, is facing the prospect of being forced to verify the ages of its UK contributors, which the organization has said could have disastrous consequences. The UK law has also shown how ineffective existing age verification methods are. Users have been able to circumvent the checks by using selfies of video game characters, AI-generated images of ID documents and, of course, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As the EFF notes, VPNs are incredibly widely used. The software allows people to browse the internet while masking their actual location. They're used by activists and students and people who want to get around geoblocks built into streaming services. Many universities and businesses (including Engadget parent company Yahoo) require their students and workers to use VPNs in order to access certain information. Blocking VPNs would have serious repercussions for all of these groups. The makers of several popular VPN services reported major spikes in the UK following the Online Safety Act going into effect this summer, with ProtonVPN reporting a 1,400 percent surge in sign-ups. That's also led to fears of a renewed crackdown on VPNs. Ofcom, the regulator tasked with enforcing the law, told TechRadar it was \"monitoring\" VPN usage, which has further fueled speculation it could try to ban or restrict their use. And here in the States, lawmakers in Wisconsin have proposed an age verification law that would require sites that host \"harmful\" content to also block VPNs.While restrictions on VPNs are, for now, mostly theoretical, the fact that such measures are even being considered is alarming. Up to now, VPN bans are more closely associated with authoritarian countries without an open internet, like Russia and China. If we continue down a path of trying to put age gates up around every piece of potentially objectionable content, the internet could get a lot worse for everyone.

Paramount, however, wants to pick up the entirety of WBD, while Netflix only wants the studios and streaming businesses. Whoever bought (or buys?) WBD would face government opposition from all sides. Paramount had already sent WBD a letter questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the acquisition bidding process before its hostile takeover bid.

          "title": "The best budgeting apps for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Over a year ago, I was prompted to look for another budgeting app. Intuit, parent company of Mint, the budgeting app I had been using for a long time, shut down the service in March 2024. The company encouraged Mint users to migrate to its other financial app, Credit Karma, but I found it to be a poor Mint replacement after trying it out. That sent me searching elsewhere to find an app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, track spending and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster.If you’re looking for a new budgeting app to get your finances straight, allow Engadget to help. I tried out Mint's top competitors in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs, and to see which are actually worth the money. Best budget apps of 2025 Other budgeting apps we tested PocketGuard PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. How we test budgeting apps Before I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) All of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. Budgeting app FAQs What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” Why did Mint shut down? When parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Brand-context AI: The missing requirement for marketing AI",
          "standfirst": "Presented by BlueOceanAI has become a central part of how marketing teams work, but the results often fall short. Models can generate content at scale and summarize information in seconds, yet the outputs are not always aligned with the brand, the audience, or the company’s strategic goals. The problem is not capability. The problem is the absence of context.The bottleneck is no longer computational power. It is contextual intelligence.Generative AI is powerful, but it doesn’t understand the nuances of the business it supports. It doesn’t have the context for why customers choose one brand over another or what creates competitive advantage. Without that grounding, AI operates as a fast executor rather than a strategic partner. It produces more, but it does not always help teams make better decisions.This becomes even more visible inside complex marketing organizations where insights live in different corners of the business and rarely come together in a unified way.As Grant McDougall, CEO of BlueOcean, explains, “Inside large marketing organizations, the data is vertical. Digital has theirs, loyalty has theirs, content has theirs, media has theirs. But CMOs think horizontally. They need to combine customer insight, competitive movement, creative performance, and sales signals into one coherent view. Connecting that data fundamentally changes how decisions get made.”This shift from vertical data to horizontal intelligence reflects a new phase in AI adoption. The emphasis is shifting from output volume to decision quality. Marketers are recognizing that the future of AI is intelligence that understands who you are as a company and why you matter to your customers.In BlueOcean’s work with global brands across technology, healthcare, and consumer industries, including Amazon, Cisco, SAP, and Intel, the same pattern appears. Teams move faster and make better decisions when AI is grounded in structured brand and competitive context.Why context is becoming the critical ingredientLarge language models excel at producing language. They do not inherently understand brand, meaning, or intention. This is why generic prompts often lead to generic outputs. The model executes based on statistical prediction, not strategic nuance.Context changes that. When AI systems are supplied with structured inputs about brand strategy, audience insight, and creative intent, the output becomes sharper and more reliable. Recommendations become more specific. Creative stays on brief. The AI begins to act less like a content generator and more like a partner that understands the boundaries and goals of the business.This shift mirrors a key theme from BlueOcean’s recent report, Building Marketing Intelligence: The CMO Blueprint for Context-Aware AI. The report explains that AI is most effective when it is grounded in a clear frame of reference. CMOs who design these context-aware workflows see better performance, stronger creative, and more reliable decision-making.For a deeper exploration of these principles, the full report is available here.The industry’s pivot: From execution to understandingMany teams remain in an experimentation phase with AI. They test tools, run pilots, and explore new workflows. This creates productivity gains but not intelligence. Without shared context, every team uses AI differently, and the result is fragmentation.The companies making the clearest progress treat context as a shared layer across workflows. When teams pull from the same brand strategy, insights, and creative guidance, AI becomes more predictable and more valuable. It supports decisions rather than contradicting them. This becomes especially effective when the context includes external signals such as shifts in sentiment, competitor movement, content performance, and broader category trends.Brand-context AI connects brand identity, customer sentiment, competitive movement, and creative performance in a single environment. It strengthens workflows in practical ways: briefs become more strategic, content reviews more accurate, and insights faster because the system synthesizes patterns teams once assembled manually.Across enterprise teams supported by BlueOcean, this shift consistently unlocks clarity. AI becomes a contributor to strategic understanding rather than a generator of disconnected output. With shared context in place, teams make more confident, coherent, and aligned decisions.Structured context: What it actually includesStructured context is the intelligence marketers already curate to understand how their brand shows up in the world. It brings together the narrative elements that shape the brand’s voice, the customer motivations that influence messaging, the competitive signals unfolding in the market, and the creative patterns that have historically performed. It also includes the external brand signals teams monitor every day: sentiment shifts, content dynamics, press and social movement, and how competitors position themselves across channels.When this information is organized into a coherent frame, AI can interpret direction and creative choices with the same clarity strategists use. The value does not come from giving AI more data; it comes from giving it structure so it can reason through decisions the way marketers already do.The new division of labor between humans and AIThe strongest AI-enabled marketing teams have one thing in common. They are clear about what humans own and what AI owns. Humans define purpose, strategy, and creative judgment. They understand emotion, cultural nuance, competitive meaning, and brand intent.AI delivers speed, scale, and precision. It excels at synthesizing information, producing iterations, and following structured instruction.“AI works best when it is given clear boundaries and clear intent,” says McDougall. “Humans set the direction led by creativity and imagination. AI executes with precision. That partnership is where the real value emerges.”The systems that perform best are the ones guided by human-defined boundaries and human-led strategy. AI provides scale, but people provide meaning.CMOs are recognizing that governing context is becoming a leadership responsibility. They already own brand, messaging, and customer insight. Extending this ownership into AI systems ensures the brand shows up consistently across every touchpoint, whether a human or a model produced the work.A practical example of context in actionConsider a team preparing a global campaign. Without context, an AI system might generate copy that sounds polished but generic. It may overlook claims the brand can make, reference benefits competitors own, or ignore differentiators that matter most. It may even amplify a competitor’s message simply because that language appears frequently in public data.With structured context, the experience changes. The model understands the audience, the brand tone, the competitive landscape, and the objective. It knows which competitors are gaining attention, which messages resonate in the market, and where the brand has permission to play. It can propose angles that strengthen positioning rather than dilute it. It can generate variations that stay on brief and avoid competitor-owned territory.BlueOcean has observed this shift inside enterprise teams including Amazon, Intel, and SAP, where structured brand and competitive context has improved alignment and reduced drift at scale.Creative, brand, and competitive signals are no longer separate inputs. When they are connected and contextualized, AI begins supporting decision-making in a meaningful way. The technology stops producing output for its own sake and starts helping marketers understand where the brand stands and what actions will grow it.What comes nextA new phase of AI is beginning. AI agents are evolving from task assistants to systems that collaborate across tools and workflows. As these systems become more capable, context will determine whether they behave unpredictably or perform as trusted extensions of the team.Brand-context AI provides a path forward. It gives AI systems the structure they need to operate consistently. It supports the teams responsible for protecting brand integrity. In practice, these agents can already assemble context-aware creative briefs, review content for competitive and brand alignment, monitor shifts in category messaging, and synthesize insights across products or markets. It creates intelligence that adapts rather than overwhelms.In the coming years, success will not come from producing more content, but from producing content anchored in brand context, the kind that sharpens decisions, strengthens positioning, and drives long-term growth.The companies that build on context today will define the generative enterprise of tomorrow.

          "content": "Presented by BlueOceanAI has become a central part of how marketing teams work, but the results often fall short. Models can generate content at scale and summarize information in seconds, yet the outputs are not always aligned with the brand, the audience, or the company’s strategic goals. The problem is not capability. The problem is the absence of context.The bottleneck is no longer computational power. It is contextual intelligence.Generative AI is powerful, but it doesn’t understand the nuances of the business it supports. It doesn’t have the context for why customers choose one brand over another or what creates competitive advantage. Without that grounding, AI operates as a fast executor rather than a strategic partner. It produces more, but it does not always help teams make better decisions.This becomes even more visible inside complex marketing organizations where insights live in different corners of the business and rarely come together in a unified way.As Grant McDougall, CEO of BlueOcean, explains, “Inside large marketing organizations, the data is vertical. Digital has theirs, loyalty has theirs, content has theirs, media has theirs. But CMOs think horizontally. They need to combine customer insight, competitive movement, creative performance, and sales signals into one coherent view. Connecting that data fundamentally changes how decisions get made.”This shift from vertical data to horizontal intelligence reflects a new phase in AI adoption. The emphasis is shifting from output volume to decision quality. Marketers are recognizing that the future of AI is intelligence that understands who you are as a company and why you matter to your customers.In BlueOcean’s work with global brands across technology, healthcare, and consumer industries, including Amazon, Cisco, SAP, and Intel, the same pattern appears. Teams move faster and make better decisions when AI is grounded in structured brand and competitive context.Why context is becoming the critical ingredientLarge language models excel at producing language. They do not inherently understand brand, meaning, or intention. This is why generic prompts often lead to generic outputs. The model executes based on statistical prediction, not strategic nuance.Context changes that. When AI systems are supplied with structured inputs about brand strategy, audience insight, and creative intent, the output becomes sharper and more reliable. Recommendations become more specific. Creative stays on brief. The AI begins to act less like a content generator and more like a partner that understands the boundaries and goals of the business.This shift mirrors a key theme from BlueOcean’s recent report, Building Marketing Intelligence: The CMO Blueprint for Context-Aware AI. The report explains that AI is most effective when it is grounded in a clear frame of reference. CMOs who design these context-aware workflows see better performance, stronger creative, and more reliable decision-making.For a deeper exploration of these principles, the full report is available here.The industry’s pivot: From execution to understandingMany teams remain in an experimentation phase with AI. They test tools, run pilots, and explore new workflows. This creates productivity gains but not intelligence. Without shared context, every team uses AI differently, and the result is fragmentation.The companies making the clearest progress treat context as a shared layer across workflows. When teams pull from the same brand strategy, insights, and creative guidance, AI becomes more predictable and more valuable. It supports decisions rather than contradicting them. This becomes especially effective when the context includes external signals such as shifts in sentiment, competitor movement, content performance, and broader category trends.Brand-context AI connects brand identity, customer sentiment, competitive movement, and creative performance in a single environment. It strengthens workflows in practical ways: briefs become more strategic, content reviews more accurate, and insights faster because the system synthesizes patterns teams once assembled manually.Across enterprise teams supported by BlueOcean, this shift consistently unlocks clarity.

          "standfirst": "Two years ago, Fairphone launched a pair of modular, fully-repairable headphones called the Fairbuds XL. Now, the Dutch social enterprise is releasing an updated version where the focus isn’t just on the quality of its hardware, but on the merits of its raw materials. The 2025 Fairbuds XL ship with new “premium” 40mm dynamic drivers and stronger N52 rated magnets for “more power and enhanced bass response.” Listeners should expect to hear “improved accuracy in mid and high frequencies” thanks to improved audio tuning. And there’s a new paper-based speaker membrane that’s more refined than what went before.Sound-quality is certainly improved over the predecessor, with cleaner bass and sharper mid and high tones. You can really hear how clean the sound is, especially when you’re listening to something lush and orchestral. Going by my memory from two years ago, the ANC seems to be unchanged, able to deal with unwanted sounds like the tapping of my own keyboard with ease. Obviously, you shouldn’t go in expecting the same sort of brilliant sound you’d get from top tier manufacturers. Although I think Fairphone has likely closed the gap so while you’re still a generation or two behind the bleeding edge, it’s not by a shameful degree. And, if we’re honest, if you’re looking for a pair of cans that’ll last you years and years, you’re likely able to forgive the absence of the shiniest bells and whistles. Closeup image of the Fairbuds XL (2025) Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt’s easy to notice the design changes, too, with the more austere Fairphone logo and the use of solid plastic in place of the original speckled pattern. Sadly, that extends to the little pop of copper found on the four way joystick, which is now a different shade of the same colorway. I get it: A lot of people want their consumer electronics to blend in, but the loss of whimsy pains me a little. There’s some fairly minor but welcome quality of life improvements, including adding automatic power off after 30 minutes. Plus, buyers get the benefit of a three year warranty, and can rest assured the XL are Longtime certified. Longtime is a new European labeling standard for gear built to be long-lived, repairable and supported by a robust repair infrastructure. And, if you already own a pair of XLs, you can buy the new drivers and slot them into your existing cans.Side showing logo.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetBut, in line with Fairphone’s founding principles, the update is equally focused on the raw materials that have gone into making the 2025 XLs. The PU “leather” found in the ear cushions — hardly a climate friendly material — has been ditched in favor of Bird’s Eye Fabric. That’s a cotton fabric produced with a series of air holes for breathability more commonly found in athleisure products. Similarly the PU found in the headband gets replaced with fabric that reminds me of plenty of other high end sport headphones.Beneath the surface, the new model contains 100 percent fair mined cobalt, copper and silver — via mining credits, at least. The rare earth metals used in the speaker magnets are now 100 percent recycled, and they were assembled in a facility using 100 percent renewable energy. You’ll also find more than 90 percent recycled aluminum, and 80 percent recycled plastics, with the company pledging to recycle an equal amount of e-waste to every pair sold. Plus, as usual, Fairphone will pay the people who assemble the hardware a living wage bonus to ensure “workers can cover their family’s needs.” Fairbuds XL are available to order today in Europe both from the Fairphone website and select third party retailers. If you’re in the US, you’ll need to wait until “later” this month, but you’ll be able to pick them up via Amazon for $229.

          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisThe State of Oklahoma discovered its blind spots the hard way. In April 2023, a legislative report revealed its agencies had spent $3 billion without proper oversight. Janet Morrow, Director of Oklahoma&#x27;s Risk, Assessment and Compliance Division, set out to track thousands of monthly transactions across dozens of disconnected systems.The Sooner State became the first U.S. state to apply process intelligence (PI) technology for procurement oversight. The transformation, Morrow says, was immediate. Real-time monitoring replaced multi-year audit cycles. The platform from market-leader Celonis quickly identified more than $10 million of inappropriate spending. And the oversight team was able to redeploy staff from 13 to 5 members while dramatically increasing effectiveness.“Process for Progress”: A global movementOklahoma&#x27;s pioneering success using powerful new process technology spotlights an emerging global trend. Morrow was among more than 3,000 leaders gathered at Celosphere, Celonis’s recent annual conference, to explore how AI, powered with business context by PI, can deliver commercial returns as well as environmental and financial benefits worldwide. The vision: process intelligence as a foundation for public and social progress. The movement sees the combination of AI and PI like Oklahoma’s as a powerful way to help governments and other organizations deliver vital services more cost effectively, with improved decisions and better-informed policies. From procurement to juvenile justice to healthcare and environment, scores of organizations are now getting a first look at the famously byzantine, opaque way things get done.For veteran financial leader Aubrey Vaughan — now Vice President of Strategy for Public Sector at Celonis and formerly a top executive at a major financial software firm — the move toward real process improvement has been a long time coming. He recalls testifying proudly before Congress a few years ago about uncovering $10 billion in improper government payments at his previous company. Afterward, a senior government official pulled him aside and suggested he downplay the achievement.The reason, he was told: \"The next question they&#x27;re going to ask you is, ‘Why is that happening?’” says Vaughn. “Today we can answer not only why, but how we fix it.\" Across the U.S. and the globe, public agencies are tightening budgets. Desire to deploy AI to close the gap is colliding with a hard reality: you can&#x27;t automate what you don&#x27;t understand. Here are three real-world examples of organizations using PI and AI for better outcomes. Oklahoma: Real-time AI spending analysis boosts accountability Within just 60 days of implementation, Celonis reviewed $29.4 billion worth of purchase order lines, identifying $8.48 billion in statutory exempt purchases and flagging problematic transactions. The system now provides real-time feedback to buyers within 15 minutes of purchases, allowing immediate course correction.The system revealed agencies were purchasing from a vendor at prices 45% lower than the statewide contract, forcing renegotiation. \"Real-time AI analysis has increased accountability by providing key insights into spending patterns and streamlining contract utilization,\" Morrow explains. Last year, Oklahoma adopted Celonis&#x27;s Copilot feature, which uses conversational AI to let executives ask questions in plain language. Now, when the Governor or a cabinet member wonders about a contract, they get answers in seconds, not weeks, Morrow says. Her group is expanding the technology to other agencies. It’s also exploring how emerging AI agent capabilities can further automate compliance and spending analysis.In Texas, uncovering a startling hidden pattern in young offenders At Evident Change, a social research non-profit, Erin Espinosa&#x27;s work is about good stewardship — not of taxpayer money, but of young lives. Analyzing 400,000 data points from juvenile justice and public health systems in Texas, the former probation officer-turned Ph.D. made a startling discovery: the mental health treatment that young offenders received (or didn’t) was a stronger predictor of incarceration than the seriousness of the offense that brought them into the system. Espinosa told courts, legislatures, Congress. Nobody believed it.Frustrated, she partnered with Monica Chiarini Tremblay, a professor at William & Mary College. While traditional analysis showed correlation, Celonis process intelligence helped the pair show a clear, quantitative causation: A fragmented mental health system was actively pushing kids toward worse outcomes. Further machine learning analysis also demonstrated that doubling down on the same interventions increased likelihood of undesirable out-of-home placement for juvenile offenders.Recently accepted for academic publication, the real-world findings represent both indictment and opportunity. Espinosa and Tremblay are planning a larger 2026 pilot implementation of PI-based analysis, bringing together social services, juvenile justice, mental health providers, and education officials. \"This is a perfect intersection of business, social work, adolescent development, and community financial implications,\" Espinosa says. They’re now exploring how AI agent technologies could flag at-risk youth and trigger coordinated responses before patterns become entrenched.A $1-trillion defense budget — that has never passed a clean audit The U.S. Department of Defense faces financial challenges on an exponentially larger scale. As Acting Secretary of the Army, Robert M. Speer hired a big-three accounting firm to map the service’s financial processes. Three years later, the analysis was obsolete — processes had changed dramatically. So, when Speer first saw process intelligence, he was truly excited about what it revealed. \"I can see not only the data,” he explained, “but where it&#x27;s coming from, the business process delivering it.\"Tom Steffens, former Deputy Chief Financial Officer of Defense, agrees: \"There&#x27;s clearly a missing piece to the puzzle.\" Both recently joined Celonis&#x27;s Public Sector Advisory Board. They see potential for AI agents to automate compliance monitoring across DoD&#x27;s complex ecosystem.The stakes are unimaginably huge. The Department of Defense will receive more than a trillion dollars in funding in FY 2026. It’s also the only federal cabinet agency that&#x27;s never passed a clean audit. Beyond accounting, fast-changing geopolitics and modern warfare demands systems as dynamic as current battle environments. \"We&#x27;re talking about the ability to shift in real time,\" says Speer. \"We know that’s what happens on the battlefield, but we need something on the back end of those enabling processes and systems to ensure that happens correctly.\" The pair is working with defense leaders to show how process intelligence can create the foundation for transformation — enabling modeling and scenario planning that can support battlefield decisions with data-driven confidence rather than delayed, obsolete information.Efforts to modernize and optimize complex government systems and processes got a big boost recently. Working with partner Knox Systems, Celonis received FedRAMP authorization earlier this year, the security credential required for federal cloud services. \"Knox powers the most secure and longest-running managed federal cloud,\" notes CEO Irina Denisenko, supporting 15+ federal agencies. The authorization positions the technology \"as the backbone of compliance for the next generation of government SaaS.\"Where process meets purposeEarly public sector adopters are proving what&#x27;s possible with process intelligence — from identifying billions in potential savings to revealing why children enter the prison pipeline. The potential extends wherever public funds shape public good: climate response, education, infrastructure, emergency services.Advocates often speak of “process for progress” or \"process for empathy\" — using transparency to change minds and hearts, not just policies. Says Chiarini Tremblay, who worked on the Texas juvenile offenders’ system: \"We have to understand complex systems and make data-driven decisions, but the goal is always improving outcomes for people.\"It’s not just a U.S. movement. In the UK, for example, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust have deployed PI with dramatic effect. Director Andy Hardy used Celonis to analyze 244,000 outpatient cases, revealing massive variation in care delivery.By optimizing appointment reminders from four to 14 days before visits, the trust enabled earlier cancellations and saw an additional 1,800 patients weekly. The waiting list was reduced by 5,300 patients in eight weeks. Concludes Hardy: \"Data understandable to clinicians is as important as scalpels.\" Technology continues to race ahead. At Celosphere 2025, Celonis unveiled a host of new offerings and platform updates for public and private sector organizations including the Orchestration Engine, which coordinates actions across workflows involving AI agents, human tasks, and legacy systems.All are built on the Celonis Process Intelligence Graph, which creates a \"living digital twin\" of a business or public agency’s processes. It’s system-agnostic, working across disconnected systems typical to government operations — integrating decades-old mainframes and cutting-edge cloud applications simultaneously.Agency heads and others note, however, that success demands more than software. For example, when Oklahoma reduced its oversight team from 13 to 5, resistance emerged. Morrow&#x27;s team invested heavily in training and change management. Process intelligence reveals improvement opportunities, but people implement solutions’ she explains. Ongoing, long-term education and cultural change are needed. “Continuous operational improvement is a lifestyle,” says Celonis’s Vaughn. “You need to have a culture that wants to build better processes, better systems, more efficient systems.”The tools are ready. The business case is proven. What remains is the will to change — and the courage to look clearly at the systems meant to serve the public good.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Espinosa told courts, legislatures, Congress. Nobody believed it.Frustrated, she partnered with Monica Chiarini Tremblay, a professor at William & Mary College. While traditional analysis showed correlation, Celonis process intelligence helped the pair show a clear, quantitative causation: A fragmented mental health system was actively pushing kids toward worse outcomes. Further machine learning analysis also demonstrated that doubling down on the same interventions increased likelihood of undesirable out-of-home placement for juvenile offenders.Recently accepted for academic publication, the real-world findings represent both indictment and opportunity. Espinosa and Tremblay are planning a larger 2026 pilot implementation of PI-based analysis, bringing together social services, juvenile justice, mental health providers, and education officials. \"This is a perfect intersection of business, social work, adolescent development, and community financial implications,\" Espinosa says. They’re now exploring how AI agent technologies could flag at-risk youth and trigger coordinated responses before patterns become entrenched.A $1-trillion defense budget — that has never passed a clean audit The U.S. Department of Defense faces financial challenges on an exponentially larger scale. As Acting Secretary of the Army, Robert M. Speer hired a big-three accounting firm to map the service’s financial processes. Three years later, the analysis was obsolete — processes had changed dramatically. So, when Speer first saw process intelligence, he was truly excited about what it revealed. \"I can see not only the data,” he explained, “but where it&#x27;s coming from, the business process delivering it.\"Tom Steffens, former Deputy Chief Financial Officer of Defense, agrees: \"There&#x27;s clearly a missing piece to the puzzle.\" Both recently joined Celonis&#x27;s Public Sector Advisory Board. They see potential for AI agents to automate compliance monitoring across DoD&#x27;s complex ecosystem.The stakes are unimaginably huge. The Department of Defense will receive more than a trillion dollars in funding in FY 2026. It’s also the only federal cabinet agency that&#x27;s never passed a clean audit. Beyond accounting, fast-changing geopolitics and modern warfare demands systems as dynamic as current battle environments. \"We&#x27;re talking about the ability to shift in real time,\" says Speer. \"We know that’s what happens on the battlefield, but we need something on the back end of those enabling processes and systems to ensure that happens correctly.\" The pair is working with defense leaders to show how process intelligence can create the foundation for transformation — enabling modeling and scenario planning that can support battlefield decisions with data-driven confidence rather than delayed, obsolete information.Efforts to modernize and optimize complex government systems and processes got a big boost recently. Working with partner Knox Systems, Celonis received FedRAMP authorization earlier this year, the security credential required for federal cloud services. \"Knox powers the most secure and longest-running managed federal cloud,\" notes CEO Irina Denisenko, supporting 15+ federal agencies. The authorization positions the technology \"as the backbone of compliance for the next generation of government SaaS.\"Where process meets purposeEarly public sector adopters are proving what&#x27;s possible with process intelligence — from identifying billions in potential savings to revealing why children enter the prison pipeline. The potential extends wherever public funds shape public good: climate response, education, infrastructure, emergency services.Advocates often speak of “process for progress” or \"process for empathy\" — using transparency to change minds and hearts, not just policies. Says Chiarini Tremblay, who worked on the Texas juvenile offenders’ system: \"We have to understand complex systems and make data-driven decisions, but the goal is always improving outcomes for people.\"It’s not just a U.S. movement. In the UK, for example, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust have deployed PI with dramatic effect. Director Andy Hardy used Celonis to analyze 244,000 outpatient cases, revealing massive variation in care delivery.By optimizing appointment reminders from four to 14 days before visits, the trust enabled earlier cancellations and saw an additional 1,800 patients weekly. The waiting list was reduced by 5,300 patients in eight weeks. Concludes Hardy: \"Data understandable to clinicians is as important as scalpels.\" Technology continues to race ahead. At Celosphere 2025, Celonis unveiled a host of new offerings and platform updates for public and private sector organizations including the Orchestration Engine, which coordinates actions across workflows involving AI agents, human tasks, and legacy systems.All are built on the Celonis Process Intelligence Graph, which creates a \"living digital twin\" of a business or public agency’s processes. It’s system-agnostic, working across disconnected systems typical to government operations — integrating decades-old mainframes and cutting-edge cloud applications simultaneously.Agency heads and others note, however, that success demands more than software. For example, when Oklahoma reduced its oversight team from 13 to 5, resistance emerged. Morrow&#x27;s team invested heavily in training and change management. Process intelligence reveals improvement opportunities, but people implement solutions’ she explains. Ongoing, long-term education and cultural change are needed. “Continuous operational improvement is a lifestyle,” says Celonis’s Vaughn. “You need to have a culture that wants to build better processes, better systems, more efficient systems.”The tools are ready. The business case is proven. What remains is the will to change — and the courage to look clearly at the systems meant to serve the public good.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "title": "Z.ai debuts open source GLM-4.6V, a native tool-calling vision model for multimodal reasoning",
          "standfirst": "Chinese AI startup Zhipu AI aka Z.ai has released its GLM-4.6V series, a new generation of open-source vision-language models (VLMs) optimized for multimodal reasoning, frontend automation, and high-efficiency deployment. The release includes two models in \"large\" and \"small\" sizes: GLM-4.6V (106B), a larger 106-billion parameter model aimed at cloud-scale inferenceGLM-4.6V-Flash (9B), a smaller model of only 9 billion parameters designed for low-latency, local applicationsRecall that generally speaking, models with more parameters — or internal settings governing their behavior, i.e. weights and biases — are more powerful, performant, and capable of performing at a higher general level across more varied tasks.However, smaller models can offer better efficiency for edge or real-time applications where latency and resource constraints are critical.The defining innovation in this series is the introduction of native function calling in a vision-language model—enabling direct use of tools such as search, cropping, or chart recognition with visual inputs. With a 128,000 token context length (equivalent to a 300-page novel&#x27;s worth of text exchanged in a single input/output interaction with the user) and state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across more than 20 benchmarks, the GLM-4.6V series positions itself as a highly competitive alternative to both closed and open-source VLMs. It&#x27;s available in the following formats:API access via OpenAI-compatible interfaceTry the demo on Zhipu’s web interfaceDownload weights from Hugging FaceDesktop assistant app available on Hugging Face SpacesLicensing and Enterprise UseGLM‑4.6V and GLM‑4.6V‑Flash are distributed under the MIT license, a permissive open-source license that allows free commercial and non-commercial use, modification, redistribution, and local deployment without obligation to open-source derivative works. This licensing model makes the series suitable for enterprise adoption, including scenarios that require full control over infrastructure, compliance with internal governance, or air-gapped environments.Model weights and documentation are publicly hosted on Hugging Face, with supporting code and tooling available on GitHub. The MIT license ensures maximum flexibility for integration into proprietary systems, including internal tools, production pipelines, and edge deployments.Architecture and Technical CapabilitiesThe GLM-4.6V models follow a conventional encoder-decoder architecture with significant adaptations for multimodal input. Both models incorporate a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder—based on AIMv2-Huge—and an MLP projector to align visual features with a large language model (LLM) decoder. Video inputs benefit from 3D convolutions and temporal compression, while spatial encoding is handled using 2D-RoPE and bicubic interpolation of absolute positional embeddings.A key technical feature is the system’s support for arbitrary image resolutions and aspect ratios, including wide panoramic inputs up to 200:1. In addition to static image and document parsing, GLM-4.6V can ingest temporal sequences of video frames with explicit timestamp tokens, enabling robust temporal reasoning.On the decoding side, the model supports token generation aligned with function-calling protocols, allowing for structured reasoning across text, image, and tool outputs. This is supported by extended tokenizer vocabulary and output formatting templates to ensure consistent API or agent compatibility.Native Multimodal Tool UseGLM-4.6V introduces native multimodal function calling, allowing visual assets—such as screenshots, images, and documents—to be passed directly as parameters to tools. This eliminates the need for intermediate text-only conversions, which have historically introduced information loss and complexity.The tool invocation mechanism works bi-directionally:Input tools can be passed images or videos directly (e.g., document pages to crop or analyze).Output tools such as chart renderers or web snapshot utilities return visual data, which GLM-4.6V integrates directly into the reasoning chain.In practice, this means GLM-4.6V can complete tasks such as:Generating structured reports from mixed-format documentsPerforming visual audit of candidate imagesAutomatically cropping figures from papers during generationConducting visual web search and answering multimodal queriesHigh Performance Benchmarks Compared to Other Similar-Sized ModelsGLM-4.6V was evaluated across more than 20 public benchmarks covering general VQA, chart understanding, OCR, STEM reasoning, frontend replication, and multimodal agents. According to the benchmark chart released by Zhipu AI:GLM-4.6V (106B) achieves SoTA or near-SoTA scores among open-source models of comparable size (106B) on MMBench, MathVista, MMLongBench, ChartQAPro, RefCOCO, TreeBench, and more.GLM-4.6V-Flash (9B) outperforms other lightweight models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B, GLM-4.1V-9B) across almost all categories tested.The 106B model’s 128K-token window allows it to outperform larger models like Step-3 (321B) and Qwen3-VL-235B on long-context document tasks, video summarization, and structured multimodal reasoning.Example scores from the leaderboard include:MathVista: 88.2 (GLM-4.6V) vs. 84.6 (GLM-4.5V) vs. 81.4 (Qwen3-VL-8B)WebVoyager: 81.0 vs. 68.4 (Qwen3-VL-8B)Ref-L4-test: 88.9 vs. 89.5 (GLM-4.5V), but with better grounding fidelity at 87.7 (Flash) vs. 86.8Both models were evaluated using the vLLM inference backend and support SGLang for video-based tasks.Frontend Automation and Long-Context WorkflowsZhipu AI emphasized GLM-4.6V’s ability to support frontend development workflows. The model can:Replicate pixel-accurate HTML/CSS/JS from UI screenshotsAccept natural language editing commands to modify layoutsIdentify and manipulate specific UI components visuallyThis capability is integrated into an end-to-end visual programming interface, where the model iterates on layout, design intent, and output code using its native understanding of screen captures.In long-document scenarios, GLM-4.6V can process up to 128,000 tokens—enabling a single inference pass across:150 pages of text (input)200 slide decks1-hour videosZhipu AI reported successful use of the model in financial analysis across multi-document corpora and in summarizing full-length sports broadcasts with timestamped event detection.Training and Reinforcement LearningThe model was trained using multi-stage pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Key innovations include:Curriculum Sampling (RLCS): Dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training samples based on model progressMulti-domain reward systems: Task-specific verifiers for STEM, chart reasoning, GUI agents, video QA, and spatial groundingFunction-aware training: Uses structured tags (e.g., <think>, <answer>, <|begin_of_box|>) to align reasoning and answer formattingThe reinforcement learning pipeline emphasizes verifiable rewards (RLVR) over human feedback (RLHF) for scalability, and avoids KL/entropy losses to stabilize training across multimodal domainsPricing (API)Zhipu AI offers competitive pricing for the GLM-4.6V series, with both the flagship model and its lightweight variant positioned for high accessibility.GLM-4.6V: $0.30 (input) / $0.90 (output) per 1M tokensGLM-4.6V-Flash: FreeCompared to major vision-capable and text-first LLMs, GLM-4.6V is among the most cost-efficient for multimodal reasoning at scale.

          "title": "Here's how Google is laying the foundation for our mixed reality future",
          "standfirst": "Today, during the XR edition of The Android Show, Google showed off a bunch of updates and new features headed to its mixed reality OS. And while most of the news was aimed at developers, I got a chance to demo some of the platform's expanded capabilities on a range of hardware including Samsung's Galaxy XR headset, two different reference designs and an early version of Xreal's Project Aura smart glasses and I came away rather impressed. So here's a rundown of what I saw and how it will impact the rapidly growing ecosystem of head-mounted displays.First up was one of Google's reference design smart glasses with a single waveguide RGB display built into its right lens. I've included a picture of it here, but try not to read too deeply into its design or aesthetics, as this device is meant to be a testbed for Android XR features and not an early look at upcoming models.Try not to read too much into the appearance of Google's reference design smart glasses, as they are explicitly labeled as prototypes meant to test upcoming features in Android XR.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAfter putting them on, I was able to ask Gemini to play some tunes on YouTube Music before answering a call simply by tapping on the touchpad built into the right side of the frames. And because the reference model also had onboard world-facing cameras, I could easily share my view with the person on the other end of the line. Naturally, I was curious about how glasses had the bandwidth to do all this, because in normal use, they rely on a Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE connection. When asked, Max Spear, Group Product Manager for XR, shared that depending on the situation, the device can seamlessly switch between both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which was rather impressive because I couldn't even detect when that transition happened. Spear also noted that one of Google's focuses for Android XR is making it easier for developers to port over the apps people already know and love. This means for devices like the reference design I wore that feature a built-in display (or displays), the OS actually uses the same code meant for standard Android notifications (like quick replies) to create a minimalist UI instead of forcing app makers to update each piece of software to be compliant with an ever-increasing number of devices. Alternatively, for models that are super lightweight and rely strictly on speakers (like Bose Frames), Google has also designed Android XR so that you only need mics and voice controls to access a wide variety of apps without the need for visual menus. This is the picture Google's reference design smart glasses created (via Gemini ) when I asked it to transform a photo I took of some pantry shelves into a sci-fi kitchen. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMeanwhile, if you're hoping to take photos with your smart glasses, there's a surprising amount of capability there, too. Not only was I able to ask Gemini to take a photo, the glasses were also able to send a higher-res version to a connected smartwatch, which is super handy in case you want to review the image before moving on to the next shot. And when you want to inject some creativity, you can ask Gemini to transform pictures into practically anything you can imagine via Nano Banana. In my case, I asked the AI to change a shot of a pantry into a sci-fi kitchen and Gemini delivered with aplomb, including converting the room into a metal-clad setting complete with lots of light strips and a few bursts of steam.However, one of the most impressive demos was when I asked Google's reference glasses to look at some of that same pantry environment and then use the ingredients to create a recipe based on my specifications (no tomatoes please, my wife isn't a fan). Gemini went down an Italian route by picking pasta, jarred banana peppers, bell peppers (which I thought was a somewhat unusual combination) and more, before launching into the first steps of the recipe. Sadly, I didn't have time to actually cook it, but as part of the demo, I learned that Gemini has been trained to understand human-centric gestures like pointing and picking things up. This allows it to better understand context without the need to be super specific, which is one of those little but very impactful tricks that allows AI to feel way less robotic. This is how Google Maps will look on Android XR. Note that this is the flat 2D version instead of the more detailed stereoscopic view available on smart glasses with dual displays. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThen I had a chance to see how Uber and Google Maps ran on the reference glasses, this time using models with both single and dual RGB displays. Surprisingly, even on the monocular version, Maps was able to generate a detailed map with the ability to zoom in and out. But when I switched over to the binocular model, I noticed a significant jump in sharpness and clarity along with a higher-fidelity map with stereoscopic 3D images of buildings. Now, it may be a bit early to call this, and the perception of sharpness varies greatly between people based on their head shape and other factors, but after seeing that, I'm even more convinced that the smart glasses with dual RGB displays are what the industry will settle on in the long term.The second type of device I used was the Samsung Galaxy XR, which I originally tried out when it was announced back in October. However, in the short time since, Google has cooked up a few new features that really help expand the headset's capabilities. By using the goggle's exterior-facing cameras, I was able to play a game of I Spy with Gemini. Admittedly, this might sound like a small addition, but I think it's going to play a big part in how we use devices running Android XR, because it allows the headset (or glasses) to understand better what you're looking at in order to provide more helpful contextual responses. Even though it was announced not long ago in late October, Samsung's Galaxy XR headset is already getting some new features thanks to some updates coming to Android XR. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetHowever, the biggest surprise was when I joined a virtual call with someone using one of Google's new avatars, called Likeness. Instead of the low-polygon cartoony characters we've seen before in places like Meta Horizon, Google's virtual representations of people's faces are almost scary good. So good I had to double-check that they weren't real and from what I've seen they're even a step up from Apple's Personas. Google says that headsets like the Galaxy XR rely on interior sensors to track and respond to facial movements, while users will be able to create and edit their avatars using a standalone app due out sometime next year. The person in the bottom right is using a Likeness, which during my demo looked surprisingly responsive and realistic. GoogleNext, I got a chance to test out the Android XR's PC connectivity by playing Stray on the Galaxy XR while it was tethered wirelessly to a nearby laptop. Not only did it run almost flawlessly with low latency, I was also able to use a paired controller instead of relying on hand-tracking or the laptop's mouse and keyboard. This is something I've been eagerly waiting to try because it feels like Google has put a lot of work into making Android XR devices play nicely with other devices and OSes. Initially, you'll only be able to connect Windows PCs to the Galaxy XR, but Google says it's looking to support macOS systems as well.Finally, I got to try out Xreal's Project Aura glasses to see how Android XR works on a device primarily designed to give you big virtual displays in a portable form factor. Unfortunately, because this was a pre-production unit, I wasn't able to take photos. That said, as far as the glasses go, I was really impressed with their resolution and sharpness and the inclusion of electrochromic glass is a really nice touch, as it allows users to change how heavily the lenses are tinted with a single touch. Alternatively, the glasses can also adjust the tint automatically based on whatever app you are using to give you a more or less isolated atmosphere, depending on the situation. I also appreciate the Aura's increased 70-degree FOV, but if I'm nitpicking, I wish it were a bit higher, as I occasionally found myself wanting a bit more vertical display area. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to take photos of Xreal's Project Aura smart glasses, as the model I used was still an early pre-production unit. So here's a shot provided by Google instead. Google / XrealAs a device that's sort of between lightweight smart glasses and a full VR headset, the Aura relies on a wired battery pack that also doubles as a touchpad and a hub for plugging in external devices like your phone, laptop or even game consoles. While using the Aura, I was able to connect to a different PC and multitask in style, as the glasses were able to support multiple virtual displays while running several different apps at the same time. This allowed me to be on a virtual call with someone using a Likeness while I had two other virtual windows open on either side. I also played an AR game (Demeo) while I moved around in virtual space and used my hands to reposition the battlefield or pick up objects with my hands. Now I will fully admit this is a lot and it took me a bit to process everything. But upon reflection, I have a few takeaways from my time with the various Android XR devices and prototypes. More than any other headset or smart glasses platform out now, it feels like Google is doing a ton to embrace a growing ecosystem of devices. That's really important because we're still so early in the lifecycle for wearable gadgets with displays that no one has really figured out a truly polished design like we have for smartphones and laptops. And until we get there, this means that a highly adaptable OS will go a long way towards supporting OEMs like Samsung, Xreal and others. But that's not all. It's clear Google is focused on making Android XR devices easy to build for. That's because the company knows that without useful software that can highlight the components and features coming on next-gen spectacles, there's a chance that interest will remain rather niche — similar to what we've seen when looking at the adoption of VR headsets. So in a way, Google is waging a battle on two fronts, which makes navigating uncharted waters that much more difficult. A major focus for Android XR while people are still figuring out how to make smart glasses is to support a wide variety of designs including those with single displays, dual displays or models without any displays that rely on cameras and speakers. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetGoogle is putting a major emphasis on Android XR's ability to serve as a framework for future gadgets and support and address developer needs. This mirrors the approach the company takes with regular Android and the opposite of Apple's typical MO, because unlike the Vision Pro and visionOS, it appears Google is going to rely heavily on its partners like Xreal, Warby Parker, Gentle Monster and others to create engaging hardware. Furthermore, Google says it plans to support smart glasses that can be tethered to Android and iOS phones, as well as smartwatches from both ecosystems, though there will be some limitations for people using Apple devices due to inherent OS restrictions. That's not to say that there won't be Pixel glasses sometime down the road, but at least for now, I think that's a smart approach and possibly a lesson Google learned after releasing Google Glass over a decade ago. Meanwhile, hi-res and incredibly realistic avatars like Likenesses could be a turning point for virtual collaboration, because, in a first for me, talking to a digital representation of someone else felt kind of natural. After my demos, I had a chance to talk to Senior Director of Product Management for XR Juston Payne, who highlighted the difference between smart glasses and typical gadgets by saying \"Smart glasses have to be great glasses first. They need to have a good form factor, good lenses with prescription support, they need to look good and they have to be easy to buy.\"That's no simple task and there's no guarantee that next-gen smart glasses and headsets will be a grand slam. But from what I've seen, Google is building a very compelling foundation with Android XR.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/heres-how-google-is-laying-the-foundation-for-our-mixed-reality-future-180000716.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Paramount has been none too pleased about Netflix striking an $82.7 billion deal to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Now, Paramount is making a hostile takeover bid for WBD. It's making its pitch directly to WBD shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share that expires on January 8.Late last week, the WBD board unanimously accepted Netflix's offer of $27.75 per share. That breaks down to $23.25 per share in cash and another $4.50 per share in Netflix stock. Netflix's overall bid is valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount's totals $108.4 billion. There's a key difference when it comes to the Paramount offer, as it’s for all of WBD. The latter is scheduled to split into two companies next year. Netflix only wants the Streaming and Studios side of WBD's business, which includes HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film, TV and game studios. Paramount is after the whole shebang, including WBD's cable channels (Global Networks). \"WBD's Board of Directors recommendation of the Netflix transaction over Paramount's offer is based on an illusory prospective valuation of Global Networks that is unsupported by the business fundamentals and encumbered by high levels of financial leverage assigned to the entity,\" Paramount said in a press release on Monday. As of the end of September, WBD was carrying $34.5 billion of gross debt. It planned to saddle the Global Networks company (aka Discovery Global) with most of that. The Paramount offer includes $40.7 billion in financing from the family of Paramount CEO David Ellison — his father is Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — and RedBird Capital, but it would be taking on more debt to secure a deal for WBD. The bid includes \"$54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.\" (Apollo owns a majority stake in Yahoo, Engadget's parent company). According to an SEC filing [PDF], other entities are backing the Paramount bid, including Jared Kushner’s investment firm Affinity Partners and the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia (the Public Investment Fund), Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Tencent was a financing partner in a previous Paramount offer, but it’s not involved with the hostile takeover attempt.In a letter sent to WBD CEO David Zazlav before the company accepted Netflix's offer, Paramount questioned the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process. It asked whether WBD was acting in the best interest of shareholders after the management team allegedly appeared to favor the Netflix offer.\"Despite Paramount submitting six proposals over the course of 12 weeks, WBD never engaged meaningfully with these proposals which we believe deliver the best outcome for WBD shareholders,\" Paramount said. \"Paramount has now taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders and its Board of Directors to ensure they have the opportunity to pursue this clearly superior alternative.\"Paramount — which Skydance bought for $8 billion this year — also claims that its offer is likely to face less regulatory scrutiny than the Netflix offer, which wouldn't close until sometime after WBD splits in two later in 2026. According to CNBC, Paramount executives believe that the company's smaller size and cozy relationship with the Trump administration will help streamline the regulatory process. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump said that Netflix's bid for WBD has \"got to go through a process, and we’ll see what happens. But it is a big market share. It could be a problem.\"In a statement to Variety, WBD said it will consider Paramount’s latest bid and provide a recommendation to its stockholders within 10 business days — in other words, by December 19. The company said it “is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix” for the time being and it is asking shareholders “not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance’s proposal.”Meanwhile, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said at an event on Monday that Paramount’s new offer was “entirely expected. We have a deal done, and we are incredibly happy with the deal. We think it’s great for our shareholders. It’s great for consumers. We think it’s a great way to create and protect jobs in the entertainment industry. We’re super confident we’re going to get it across the line and finish.”Update December 8, 2025, 11:14AM ET: Added details about the involvement of sovereign wealth funds and Affinity Partners.Update December 8, 2025, 2:38PM ET: Added the responses from WBD and Netflix.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Anthropic has launched a beta integration that connects its fast-growing Claude Code programming agent directly into Slack, allowing software engineers to delegate coding tasks without leaving the workplace messaging platform where much of their daily communication already happens.The release, which Anthropic describes as a \"research preview,\" is the company&#x27;s latest move to embed its technology deeper into enterprise workflows — and comes as Claude Code has emerged as a surprise revenue engine, generating more than $1 billion in annualized revenue just six months after its public debut.\"The critical context around engineering work often lives in Slack, including bug reports, feature requests and engineering discussions,\" the company wrote in a blog post. \"When a bug report appears or a teammate needs a code fix, you can now tag Claude in Slack to automatically spin up a Claude Code session using the surrounding context.\"From bug report to pull request: How the new Slack integration actually worksThe mechanics are deceptively simple but address a persistent friction point in software development: The gap between where problems are discussed and where they are fixed.When a user mentions @Claude in a Slack channel or thread, Claude analyzes the message to determine whether it constitutes a coding task. If it does, the system automatically creates a new Claude Code session. Users can also explicitly instruct Claude to treat requests as coding tasks.Claude gathers context from recent Slack channel and thread messages to feed into the Claude Code session. It will use this context to automatically choose which repository to run the task on based on the repositories that have been authenticated to Claude Code on the web.As the Claude Code session progresses, Claude posts status updates back to the Slack thread. Once complete, users receive a link to the full session where they can review changes, along with a direct link to open a pull request.The feature builds on Anthropic&#x27;s existing Claude for Slack integration and requires users to have access to Claude Code on the web. In practical terms, a product manager reporting a bug in Slack could tag Claude, which would then analyze the conversation context, identify the relevant code repository, investigate the issue, propose a fix and post a pull request — all while updating the original Slack thread with its progress.Why Anthropic is betting big on enterprise workflow integrationsThe Slack integration arrives at a pivotal moment for Anthropic. Claude Code has already hit $1 billion in revenue, six months after its public debut, according to a LinkedIn post from Anthropic&#x27;s CPO Mike Krieger. The coding agent continues to barrel toward scale with customers like Netflix, Spotify and Salesforce.The velocity of that growth helps explain why Anthropic made its first-ever acquisition earlier this month, of developer tool startup Bun. Anthropic declined to comment on specific financial details. Bun is a breakthrough JavaScript runtime that claims to be dramatically faster than the leading competition. As an all-in-one toolkit — combining runtime, package manager, bundler and test runner — it&#x27;s become essential infrastructure for AI-led software engineering, helping developers build and test applications at unprecedented velocity.Since becoming generally available in May 2025, Claude Code has grown from its origins as an internal engineering experiment into a critical tool for many of the world&#x27;s category-leading enterprises, including Netflix, Spotify, KPMG, L&#x27;Oreal and Salesforce — and Bun has been key in helping scale its infrastructure throughout that evolution.The acquisition signals that Anthropic views Claude Code not as a peripheral feature but as a core business line worth substantial investment. The Slack integration extends that bet, positioning Claude Code as an ambient presence in the workspaces where engineering decisions actually get made.According to an Anthropic spokesperson, companies including Rakuten, Novo Nordisk, Uber, Snowflake and Ramp now use Claude Code for both professional and novice developers. Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant, has reportedly reduced software development timelines from 24 to 5 days using the tool — a 79% reduction that illustrates the productivity claims Anthropic has been making.Claude Code&#x27;s rapid rise from internal experiment to billion-dollar productThe Slack launch is the latest in a rapid series of Claude Code expansions. In late November, Claude Code was added to Anthropic&#x27;s desktop apps, including the Mac version. Previously, Claude Code was limited to mobile apps and the web. The desktop version allows software engineers to code, research and update work with multiple local and remote sessions running at the same time.That release accompanied Anthropic&#x27;s unveiling of Claude Opus 4.5, its newest and most capable model. Claude Opus 4.5 is available today on the company&#x27;s apps, API and on all three major cloud platforms. Pricing is $5/$25 per million tokens — making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams and enterprises.The company has also invested heavily in the developer infrastructure that powers Claude Code. In late November, Anthropic released three new beta features for tool use: Tool Search Tool, which allows Claude to access thousands of tools without consuming its context window; Programmatic Tool Calling, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment, thus reducing the impact on the model&#x27;s context window; and Tool Use Examples, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given tool.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems. Connecting agents to tools and data traditionally requires a custom integration for each pairing, creating fragmentation and duplicated effort that makes it difficult to scale truly connected systems. MCP provides a universal protocol — developers implement MCP once in their agent, and it unlocks an entire ecosystem of integrations.Inside Anthropic&#x27;s own AI transformation: What happens when engineers use Claude all dayAnthropic has been unusually transparent about how its own engineers use Claude Code — and the findings offer a preview of broader workforce implications. In August 2025, Anthropic surveyed 132 engineers and researchers, conducted 53 in-depth qualitative interviews and studied internal Claude Code usage data to understand how AI use is changing work at the company.Employees self-reported using Claude in 60% of their work and achieved a 50% productivity boost, a 2-3x increase from this time last year. This productivity looks like slightly less time per task category, but considerably more output volume.Perhaps most notably, 27% of Claude-assisted work consists of tasks that wouldn&#x27;t have been done otherwise, such as scaling projects, making nice-to-have tools like interactive data dashboards, and exploratory work that wouldn&#x27;t be cost-effective if done manually.The internal research also revealed how Claude is changing the nature of engineering collaboration. The maximum number of consecutive tool calls Claude Code makes per transcript increased by 116%. Claude now chains together 21.2 independent tool calls without the need for human intervention, versus 9.8 tool calls from six months ago.The number of human turns decreased by 33%. The average number of human turns decreased from 6.2 to 4.1 per transcript, suggesting that less human input is necessary to accomplish a given task now, compared to six months ago.But the research also surfaced tensions. One prominent theme was that Claude has become the first stop for questions that once went to colleagues. \"It has reduced my dependence on [my team] by 80%, [but] the last 20% is crucial, and I go and talk to them,\" one engineer explained. Several engineers said they \"bounce ideas off\" Claude, similar to interactions with human collaborators.Some appreciate the reduced social friction, but others resist the change or miss the older way of working: \"I like working with people, and it is sad that I need them less now.\"How Anthropic stacks up against OpenAI, Google and Microsoft in the enterprise AI raceAnthropic is not alone in racing to capture the enterprise coding market. OpenAI, Google and Microsoft (through GitHub Copilot) are all pursuing similar integrations. The Slack launch gives Anthropic a presence in one of the most widely used enterprise communication platforms — Slack claims over 750,000 organizations use its software.The deal comes as Anthropic pursues a more disciplined growth path than rival OpenAI, focusing on enterprise customers and coding workloads. Internal financials reported by The Wall Street Journal show that Anthropic expects to break even by 2028 — two years earlier than OpenAI, which continues to invest heavily in infrastructure as it expands into video, hardware and consumer products.The move also marks an increased push into developer tooling. Anthropic has recently seen backing from some of tech&#x27;s biggest titans. Microsoft and Nvidia pledged up to $15 billion in fresh investment in Anthropic last month, alongside a $30 billion commitment from Anthropic to run Claude Code on Microsoft&#x27;s cloud. This is in addition to the $8 billion invested by Amazon and $3 billion by Google.The cross-investment from both Microsoft and Google — fierce competitors in the cloud and AI spaces — highlights Anthropic&#x27;s valuable enterprise positioning. By integrating with Slack (which is owned by Salesforce), Anthropic further embeds itself in the enterprise software ecosystem while remaining platform-agnostic.What the Slack integration means for developers — and whether they can trust itFor engineering teams, the Slack integration promises to collapse the distance between problem identification and resolution. A bug report in a Slack channel can immediately trigger an investigation. A feature request can spawn a prototype. A code review comment can generate a refactor.But the integration also raises questions about oversight and code quality. Most Anthropic employees use Claude frequently while reporting they can \"fully delegate\" only 0 to 20% of their work to it. Claude is a constant collaborator, but using it generally involves active supervision and validation, especially in high-stakes work, versus handing off tasks requiring no verification at all.Some employees are concerned about the atrophy of deeper skillsets required for both writing and critiquing code — \"When producing output is so easy and fast, it gets harder and harder to actually take the time to learn something.\"The Slack integration, by making Claude Code invocation as simple as an @mention, may accelerate both the productivity benefits and the skill-atrophy concerns that Anthropic&#x27;s own research has documented.The future of coding may be conversational—and Anthropic is racing to prove itThe beta launch marks the beginning of what Anthropic expects will be a broader rollout, with documentation forthcoming for teams looking to deploy the integration and refinements planned based on user feedback during the research preview phase.For Anthropic, the Slack integration is a calculated bet on a fundamental shift in how software gets written. The company is wagering that the future of coding will be conversational — the walls between where developers talk about problems and where they solve them will dissolve entirely. The companies that win enterprise AI, in this view, will be the ones that meet developers not in specialized tools but in the chat windows they already have open all day.Whether that vision becomes reality will depend on whether Claude Code can deliver enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining the security that organizations demand. The early returns are promising: A billion dollars in revenue, a roster of Fortune 500 customers and a growing ecosystem of integrations suggest Anthropic is onto something real.But in one of Anthropic&#x27;s own internal interviews, an engineer offered a more cautious assessment of the transformation underway: \"Nobody knows what&#x27;s going to happen… the important thing is to just be really adaptable.\"In the age of AI coding agents, that may be the only career advice that holds up.",

          "standfirst": "Every December, the Engadget staff compiles a list of the year’s biggest winners. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made the most impact over the course of the year. Not all of that influence is positive, however, and some selections may also appear on our list of biggest losers. Still, sit back and enjoy our picks for the biggest winners of 2025.Nintendo Switch 2Playing Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 in handheld mode.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAside from a big bump in battery life that many were hoping for, Nintendo took just about everything that made its last console such a phenomenon and upgraded it on the Switch 2. A sleeker design with magnetic Joy-Cons that are less likely to break, a larger (albeit LCD) 1080p display with HDR, much stronger performance, mouse controls and a boost to the base storage were all very welcome.Of course, the vast majority of Switch games run on the Switch 2 (often with visual improvements or other upgrades), so the new console had a vast library right from the jump. Nintendo is building out its slate of first-party games with treats like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4, and the third-party support is seriously impressive too. Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6 and Hitman: World of Assassination are already available, and the likes of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods are on the way.The Switch 2 is an iteration, not a revolution, but Nintendo didn't need to reinvent the wheel to make another great system. It's little surprise, then, that we gave the Switch 2 a score of 93 in our review. The console is surpassing Nintendo's sales expectations as well. The company said in November that it believes it will sell 19 million units (up from 15 million) by the time its current fiscal year ends in March. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterNVIDIANVIDIA GeForce 5070 TiDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetCould things be any rosier for NVIDIA? Once just a video card company for gamers, NVIDIA's GPU hardware is now directly tied to the rise of the AI industry. Its stock has jumped a whopping 1,235 percent over the past five years, going from $13.56 per share in 2020 to a peak of $202.49 this past October. NVIDIA's server-grade cards are being used en masse to train AI models, as well as to power AI inferencing. At home, its GeForce GPUs are enabling local AI development and they're still the gaming cards to beat, despite AMD's steadily improving competition.Clearly, the company's bet on parallel processing has paid off enormously. Its GPUs can handle tons of computations simultaneously, making them ideally suited for the demands of the AI industry. They're not exactly efficient — that's why neural processing units, or NPUs have sprung up to power consumer AI features — but it's hard to deny NVIDIA's raw computational power. NVIDIA's AI success may not last forever, though. Companies like Google and Microsoft are already working on their own AI chips, and it's still unclear if consumers actually want widespread AI features as much as tech companies think. If the AI industry crashes, NVIDIA will be one of the first victims. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterTech billionairesUS President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk (L) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 30, 2025. ALLISON ROBBERT via Getty ImagesThere's no doubt that tech billionaires, especially those that lean conservatively, have benefitted tremendously from the Trump administration over the past year. Elon Musk's DOGE team of tech loyalists chainsawed their way through the budgets and staff of several federal agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates Tesla. (That hasn't stopped the NHTSA from launching a new investigation into Tesla's full self-driving tech, though.)According to a recent report by Oxfam, the 10 richest US billionaires (who are all tech leaders, save for Warren Buffet) increased their wealth by $698 billion of the past year. Of course, it took plenty of wining and dining to get there. Elon Musk reportedly donated nearly $300 million to Trump and Republican allies, and several tech companies have pitched in to build the president's lavish White House ballroom. But the result for the tech elite is increased access to the president, less scrutiny when it comes to acquisitions and other deals, and the potential for massive corporate and elite tax cuts. — D.H.AI videoA silhouetted individual is seen holding a mobile phone with a Sora of ChatGPT OpenAI logo displayed in the backgroundSOPA Images via Getty ImagesAI slop didn't start in 2025, but it reached new heights thanks to updates from Meta, Google, OpenAI and others that made it easier than ever to create a real-ish (emphasis on the ish) looking clips from nothing but your most unhinged mad libs. Now, AI-generated videos are just about impossible to avoid. Some platforms, like Pinterest and TikTok, have even begun offering people the ability to ask their algorithms to show less AI content in their feeds. Unfortunately, there's no way to stuff Shrimp Jesus back into the bottle. AI video is everywhere and it's here to stay. It's not only overtaken Facebook and Instagram's recommendations, Meta created an entirely separate feed just for users' AI-generated fever dreams. OpenAI's Sora, which lets you make AI videos of real people, was downloaded a million times in just a few days. Google's Veo, which generated more than 40 million videos in a matter of weeks, is now built-in to YouTube Shorts.It's now trivially easy for creators to churn out fake movie trailers, cute animal videos that never happened or viral clips of made up ICE raids. Hell, the president of the United States regularly shares bizarre, sometimes poop-themed, AI videos on his official social media channels. During the government shutdown, the official X account for Senate Republicans shared a deepfake of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. AI video is winning not just because it's everywhere, but because so many are unable, or unwilling, to understand what's real and what isn't. More than half of Americans say they are not confident in their ability to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, according to Pew Research. Similar numbers of people report being \"more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life.\" But those concerns have done little to stop AI slop from dominating all of our feeds, and there's no sign it will ever slow down. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterGalaxy Z Fold 7Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAfter seven generations, Samsung reached an important milestone this year with its Galaxy Z Fold line: It made a foldable phone that’s the same size as a regular handset. In fact, weighing 7.58 ounces and measuring 72.8mm wide, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is actually lighter and narrower than an S25 Ultra, while being practically just as thin at 8.9mm (folded). It’s a real marvel of engineering, especially when you consider the phone also features a 200MP main camera, an IPX8 rating for water resistance and a 5,000 mAh battery with 45-watt wired charging. And of course, there's that huge 8-inch main screen hiding inside, which makes the Z Fold 7 both a phone and a tablet in one device. The only thing it's really missing is the improved dust resistance Google gave to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. But perhaps more importantly, the Z Fold 7's reduced size and weight have created a device with wider appeal. This has propelled sales of Samsung's latest flagship foldable up 50 percent compared to the previous generation while pushing shipments of foldables as a whole to record highs. Who knew that when Samsung focuses on creating world-class hardware instead of overindexing on AI, good things happen? Okay, maybe that’s a bit harsh. Regardless, for a phone category that has struggled with excess weight and bulk since its inception, the Z Fold 7 feels like a revelation and the beginning of a new era for handsets with flexible displays. Now, can we just bring their prices down, please? — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterSmart glassesSenior reporter Karissa Bell wearing a pair of Ray Ban Display glasses. Karissa Bell for EngadgetLike it or not, smart glasses are having a moment. Propelled by new devices like the Meta Ray-Ban Display and upcoming models like Xreal’s Project Aura, the idea of wearing specs with built-in screens suddenly became an attractive proposition. And that means a lot for a category of gadgets that’s often best remembered by the fashion tragedy that was Google Glass in 2013. However, this development isn’t purely by chance. The latest generation of smart glasses has only just now become a reality due to the convergence of several branches of tech — including improved optics, lightweight batteries and, of course, AI. Now that last one might sound silly considering how many big companies seem to be betting the farm on machine learning being the next big thing, but AI will be a critical feature for enabling the hands-free experience that you need to make smartglasses work when you can’t rely on touch input. While this category is still in its early stages of development, the increased momentum we've seen from smart glasses this year seems poised to carry them towards being a future pillar of people's core tech kits. — S.R.Fast chargingFast charging on the Pixel Watch 4 is one implementation that impressed us this year.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetDevices like tablets and smartwatches have matured to the point where each generation mostly sees iterative upgrades, making covering them seem boring. But this year, as the hardware review season came to a close, I noticed an interesting trend. One feature, across various product categories, genuinely excited myself and other reviewers at Engadget and around the internet: impressively fast charging. By itself, high-speed charging isn’t new. But when I reviewed the Pixel Watch 4 in October, I was shocked that one seemingly little update changed how I went about my day. The new power system on Google’s smartwatch was so efficient that after about ten minutes on a cradle, the wearable went from below 20 percent to past 50 percent. With that boost, I stopped having to remind myself to plug the watch in — any time I ran low or was about to run out the door, I just plopped it on the charger and would have enough juice for hours.Google wasn’t the only company to make fast-charging a meaningful addition to one of its 2025 products. Apple’s iPad Pro M5 is the first iPad to support the feature, and while in our testing it fell a little short of the 50 percent charge in 30 minutes that the company promised, our reviewer Nate Ingraham still found it a meaningful improvement.Observers of the smartphone industry will likely point out two things. First, battery technology can be volatile, and larger, faster-charging cells might lead to exploding phones. So my optimism about this development is not without caution. Secondly, we’ve already seen all this come to handsets, especially in phones that launched outside the US first. OnePlus is known for its SUPERVOOC fast charging system, for example, and we’re seeing even more novel battery tech show up abroad. Calling fast charging a winner of 2025 may feel untimely to some.But when you consider the spread of speedier charging to other types of products, especially in electric vehicles that till now take forever to top up, the benefits are clear. This year, we saw Formula E (finally) debut its fast-charging pit stops, Honda announce its first full-size electric motorcycle with fast charging and Chinese EV maker BYD unveiling new tech that delivers peak EV charging speeds of 1,000 kilowatts. That should about halve the time it currently takes to top up your electric car. Sure, it’s not the most eye-catching or novel technological development. But when counted in terms of precious time saved, fast charging coming to more types of devices certainly amounts to a greater good in gadgets in 2025. — Cherlynn Low, Managing editorMagnetsThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold and the Pixel Ring StandSam Rutherford for EngadgetTwo years after the announcement of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard and its support of magnetic attachment accessories (a la Apple’s MagSafe), we’re finally seeing one of the more mainstream Android devices adopt it. In 2025, Google became the first Android phone maker that’s not HMD to do so, bringing such magnetic capabilities to the Pixel 10 series. It also introduced Pixelsnap — its own version of a MagSafe accessory ecosystem, including a slim puck with a fold-out kickstand that you can snap onto a phone. I love the Pixel Ring Stand and make sure to bring it with me whenever I can. It works perfectly with my iPhone 17 Pro, and has a compact footprint that makes it easy to take anywhere. Of course, it’s not the first of its kind — Case-Mate and PopSocket, among others, already make similar products but they’re either pricier or rated poorly. But it’s not just Google that made a magnetic accessory I unexpectedly adored. When reports of Apple’s Crossbody Strap first trickled out, I was underwhelmed. Who cares about a crossbody strap for an iPhone? But when I was presented with one to try at the iPhone 17 launch event, my cynicism quickly melted into desire. Setting aside the convenience of having your phone on your person when you don’t have pockets or a purse, the way magnets play a part here also won me over. To adjust the length of the straps, you just separate the two overlapping pieces that stick together magnetically, move them along each other till you’re satisfied with the length and let them snap back in place. I’m sure Apple isn’t the first to make a crossbody strap accessory for iPhones, nor is it the first to use magnets to adjust such straps. But like many Redditors, I’ve slowly come to realize the differences between those products and the Crossbody Strap for iPhone 17. It’s far from perfect, but in 2025 it was another implementation of magnets in tech that caught my attention and brought convenience to my life. — C.L.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Every December, the Engadget staff compiles a list of the year’s biggest winners. We scour over articles from the previous 12 months to determine the people, companies, products and trends that made the most impact over the course of the year. Not all of that influence is positive, however, and some selections may also appear on our list of biggest losers. Still, sit back and enjoy our picks for the biggest winners of 2025.Nintendo Switch 2Playing Mario Kart World on the Switch 2 in handheld mode.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAside from a big bump in battery life that many were hoping for, Nintendo took just about everything that made its last console such a phenomenon and upgraded it on the Switch 2. A sleeker design with magnetic Joy-Cons that are less likely to break, a larger (albeit LCD) 1080p display with HDR, much stronger performance, mouse controls and a boost to the base storage were all very welcome.Of course, the vast majority of Switch games run on the Switch 2 (often with visual improvements or other upgrades), so the new console had a vast library right from the jump. Nintendo is building out its slate of first-party games with treats like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4, and the third-party support is seriously impressive too. Cyberpunk 2077, Street Fighter 6 and Hitman: World of Assassination are already available, and the likes of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and FromSoftware's Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods are on the way.The Switch 2 is an iteration, not a revolution, but Nintendo didn't need to reinvent the wheel to make another great system. It's little surprise, then, that we gave the Switch 2 a score of 93 in our review. The console is surpassing Nintendo's sales expectations as well. The company said in November that it believes it will sell 19 million units (up from 15 million) by the time its current fiscal year ends in March. — Kris Holt, Contributing reporterNVIDIANVIDIA GeForce 5070 TiDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetCould things be any rosier for NVIDIA? Once just a video card company for gamers, NVIDIA's GPU hardware is now directly tied to the rise of the AI industry. Its stock has jumped a whopping 1,235 percent over the past five years, going from $13.56 per share in 2020 to a peak of $202.49 this past October. NVIDIA's server-grade cards are being used en masse to train AI models, as well as to power AI inferencing. At home, its GeForce GPUs are enabling local AI development and they're still the gaming cards to beat, despite AMD's steadily improving competition.Clearly, the company's bet on parallel processing has paid off enormously. Its GPUs can handle tons of computations simultaneously, making them ideally suited for the demands of the AI industry. They're not exactly efficient — that's why neural processing units, or NPUs have sprung up to power consumer AI features — but it's hard to deny NVIDIA's raw computational power. NVIDIA's AI success may not last forever, though. Companies like Google and Microsoft are already working on their own AI chips, and it's still unclear if consumers actually want widespread AI features as much as tech companies think. If the AI industry crashes, NVIDIA will be one of the first victims. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterTech billionairesUS President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk (L) in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on May 30, 2025. ALLISON ROBBERT via Getty ImagesThere's no doubt that tech billionaires, especially those that lean conservatively, have benefitted tremendously from the Trump administration over the past year. Elon Musk's DOGE team of tech loyalists chainsawed their way through the budgets and staff of several federal agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates Tesla. (That hasn't stopped the NHTSA from launching a new investigation into Tesla's full self-driving tech, though.)According to a recent report by Oxfam, the 10 richest US billionaires (who are all tech leaders, save for Warren Buffet) increased their wealth by $698 billion of the past year. Of course, it took plenty of wining and dining to get there. Elon Musk reportedly donated nearly $300 million to Trump and Republican allies, and several tech companies have pitched in to build the president's lavish White House ballroom. But the result for the tech elite is increased access to the president, less scrutiny when it comes to acquisitions and other deals, and the potential for massive corporate and elite tax cuts. — D.H.AI videoA silhouetted individual is seen holding a mobile phone with a Sora of ChatGPT OpenAI logo displayed in the backgroundSOPA Images via Getty ImagesAI slop didn't start in 2025, but it reached new heights thanks to updates from Meta, Google, OpenAI and others that made it easier than ever to create a real-ish (emphasis on the ish) looking clips from nothing but your most unhinged mad libs. Now, AI-generated videos are just about impossible to avoid. Some platforms, like Pinterest and TikTok, have even begun offering people the ability to ask their algorithms to show less AI content in their feeds. Unfortunately, there's no way to stuff Shrimp Jesus back into the bottle. AI video is everywhere and it's here to stay. It's not only overtaken Facebook and Instagram's recommendations, Meta created an entirely separate feed just for users' AI-generated fever dreams. OpenAI's Sora, which lets you make AI videos of real people, was downloaded a million times in just a few days. Google's Veo, which generated more than 40 million videos in a matter of weeks, is now built-in to YouTube Shorts.It's now trivially easy for creators to churn out fake movie trailers, cute animal videos that never happened or viral clips of made up ICE raids. Hell, the president of the United States regularly shares bizarre, sometimes poop-themed, AI videos on his official social media channels. During the government shutdown, the official X account for Senate Republicans shared a deepfake of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. AI video is winning not just because it's everywhere, but because so many are unable, or unwilling, to understand what's real and what isn't. More than half of Americans say they are not confident in their ability to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, according to Pew Research. Similar numbers of people report being \"more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life.\" But those concerns have done little to stop AI slop from dominating all of our feeds, and there's no sign it will ever slow down. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterGalaxy Z Fold 7Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAfter seven generations, Samsung reached an important milestone this year with its Galaxy Z Fold line: It made a foldable phone that’s the same size as a regular handset. In fact, weighing 7.58 ounces and measuring 72.8mm wide, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is actually lighter and narrower than an S25 Ultra, while being practically just as thin at 8.9mm (folded). It’s a real marvel of engineering, especially when you consider the phone also features a 200MP main camera, an IPX8 rating for water resistance and a 5,000 mAh battery with 45-watt wired charging. And of course, there's that huge 8-inch main screen hiding inside, which makes the Z Fold 7 both a phone and a tablet in one device. The only thing it's really missing is the improved dust resistance Google gave to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. But perhaps more importantly, the Z Fold 7's reduced size and weight have created a device with wider appeal. This has propelled sales of Samsung's latest flagship foldable up 50 percent compared to the previous generation while pushing shipments of foldables as a whole to record highs. Who knew that when Samsung focuses on creating world-class hardware instead of overindexing on AI, good things happen? Okay, maybe that’s a bit harsh. Regardless, for a phone category that has struggled with excess weight and bulk since its inception, the Z Fold 7 feels like a revelation and the beginning of a new era for handsets with flexible displays. Now, can we just bring their prices down, please? — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterSmart glassesSenior reporter Karissa Bell wearing a pair of Ray Ban Display glasses. Karissa Bell for EngadgetLike it or not, smart glasses are having a moment. Propelled by new devices like the Meta Ray-Ban Display and upcoming models like Xreal’s Project Aura, the idea of wearing specs with built-in screens suddenly became an attractive proposition. And that means a lot for a category of gadgets that’s often best remembered by the fashion tragedy that was Google Glass in 2013. However, this development isn’t purely by chance. The latest generation of smart glasses has only just now become a reality due to the convergence of several branches of tech — including improved optics, lightweight batteries and, of course, AI. Now that last one might sound silly considering how many big companies seem to be betting the farm on machine learning being the next big thing, but AI will be a critical feature for enabling the hands-free experience that you need to make smartglasses work when you can’t rely on touch input. While this category is still in its early stages of development, the increased momentum we've seen from smart glasses this year seems poised to carry them towards being a future pillar of people's core tech kits. — S.R.Fast chargingFast charging on the Pixel Watch 4 is one implementation that impressed us this year.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetDevices like tablets and smartwatches have matured to the point where each generation mostly sees iterative upgrades, making covering them seem boring. But this year, as the hardware review season came to a close, I noticed an interesting trend. One feature, across various product categories, genuinely excited myself and other reviewers at Engadget and around the internet: impressively fast charging. By itself, high-speed charging isn’t new. But when I reviewed the Pixel Watch 4 in October, I was shocked that one seemingly little update changed how I went about my day. The new power system on Google’s smartwatch was so efficient that after about ten minutes on a cradle, the wearable went from below 20 percent to past 50 percent. With that boost, I stopped having to remind myself to plug the watch in — any time I ran low or was about to run out the door, I just plopped it on the charger and would have enough juice for hours.Google wasn’t the only company to make fast-charging a meaningful addition to one of its 2025 products. Apple’s iPad Pro M5 is the first iPad to support the feature, and while in our testing it fell a little short of the 50 percent charge in 30 minutes that the company promised, our reviewer Nate Ingraham still found it a meaningful improvement.Observers of the smartphone industry will likely point out two things. First, battery technology can be volatile, and larger, faster-charging cells might lead to exploding phones. So my optimism about this development is not without caution. Secondly, we’ve already seen all this come to handsets, especially in phones that launched outside the US first. OnePlus is known for its SUPERVOOC fast charging system, for example, and we’re seeing even more novel battery tech show up abroad.

          "standfirst": "When many enterprises weren’t even thinking about agentic behaviors or infrastructures, Booking.com had already “stumbled” into them with its homegrown conversational recommendation system. This early experimentation has allowed the company to take a step back and avoid getting swept up in the frantic AI agent hype. Instead, it is taking a disciplined, layered, modular approach to model development: small, travel-specific models for cheap, fast inference; larger large language models (LLMs) for reasoning and understanding; and domain-tuned evaluations built in-house when precision is critical. Listen and subscribe to Beyond the Pilot on Spotify, Apple or wherever you get your podcasts.With this hybrid strategy — and selective collaboration with OpenAI, Gemini and other key players in the AI space — Booking.com has seen accuracy double across key retrieval, ranking and customer-interaction tasks. As Pranav Pathak, Booking.com’s AI product development lead, posed to VentureBeat in a new podcast: “Do you build it very, very specialized and bespoke and then have an army of a hundred agents? Or do you keep it general enough and have five agents that are good at generalized tasks, but then you have to orchestrate a lot around them? That&#x27;s a balance that I think we&#x27;re still trying to figure out, as is the rest of the industry.”Moving from guessing to deep personalization without being ‘creepy’Recommendation systems are core to Booking.com’s customer-facing platforms; however, traditional recommendation tools have been less about recommendation and more about guessing, Pathak conceded. So, from the start, he and his team vowed to avoid generic tools: As he put it, the price and recommendation should be based on customer context. Booking.com’s initial pre-gen AI tooling for intent and topic detection was a small language model, what Pathak described as “the scale and size of BERT.” The model ingested the customer’s inputs around their problem to determine whether it could be solved through self-service or bumped to a human agent. “We started with an architecture of ‘you have to call a tool if this is the intent you detect and this is how you&#x27;ve parsed the structure,” Pathak explained. “That was very, very similar to the first few agentic architectures that came out in terms of reason and defining a tool call.” His team has since built out that architecture to include an LLM orchestrator that classifies queries, triggers retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and calls APIs or smaller, specialized language models. “We&#x27;ve been able to scale that system quite well because it was so close in architecture that, with a few tweaks, we now have a full agentic stack,” said Pathak. As a result, Booking.com is seeing a notable increase in topic detection, with more topics, even complicated ones previously identified as ‘other’ and requiring escalation, are becoming automated. Ultimately, this supports more self-service, freeing human agents to focus on customers with uniquely-specific problems that the platform doesn’t have a dedicated tool flow for — say, a family that is unable to access its hotel room at 2 a.m. when the front desk is closed. That not only “really starts to compound,” but has a direct, long-term impact on customer retention, Pathak noted. “One of the things we&#x27;ve seen is, the better we are at customer service, the more loyal our customers are.” Another recent rollout is personalized filtering. Booking.com has between 200 and 250 search filters on its website — an unrealistic amount for any human to sift through, Pathak pointed out. So, his team introduced a free text box that users can type into to immediately receive tailored filters. “That becomes such an important cue for personalization in terms of what you&#x27;re looking for in your own words rather than a clickstream,” said Pathak. In turn, it cues Booking.com into what customers actually want. For instance, hot tubs — when filter personalization first rolled out, jacuzzi’s were one of the most popular requests. That wasn’t even a consideration previously; there wasn’t even a filter. Now that filter is live. “I had no idea,” Pathak noted. “I had never searched for a hot tub in my room honestly.” When it comes to personalization, though, there is a fine line; memory remains complicated, Pathak emphasized. While it’s important to have long-term memories and evolving threads with customers — retaining information like their typical budgets, preferred hotel star ratings or whether they need disability access — it must be on their terms and protective of their privacy. Booking.com is extremely mindful with memory, seeking consent so as to not be “creepy” when collecting customer information. “Managing memory is much harder than actually building memory,” said Pathak. “The tech is out there, we have the technical chops to build it. We want to make sure we don&#x27;t launch a memory object that doesn&#x27;t respect customer consent, that doesn&#x27;t feel very natural.”Finding a balance of build versus buy As agents mature, Booking.com is navigating a central question facing the entire industry: How narrow should agents become? Instead of committing to either a swarm of highly specialized agents or a few generalized ones, the company aims for reversible decisions and avoids “one-way doors” that lock its architecture into long-term, costly paths. Pathak’s strategy is: Generalize where possible, specialize where necessary and keep agent design flexible to help ensure resiliency. Pathak and his team are “very mindful” of use cases, evaluating where to build more generalized, reusable agents or more task-specific ones. They strive to use the smallest model possible, with the highest level of accuracy and output quality, for each use case. Whatever can be generalized is. Latency is another important consideration. When factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations is paramount, his team will use a larger, much slower model; but with search and recommendations, user expectations set speed. (Pathak noted: “No one’s patient.”) “We would, for example, never use something as heavy as GPT-5 for just topic detection or for entity extraction,” he said. Booking.com takes a similarly elastic tack when it comes to monitoring and evaluations: If it&#x27;s general-purpose monitoring that someone else is better at building and has horizontal capability, they’ll buy it. But if it’s instances where brand guidelines must be enforced, they’ll build their own evals. Ultimately, Booking.com has leaned into being “super anticipatory,” agile and flexible. “At this point with everything that&#x27;s happening with AI, we are a little bit averse to walking through one way doors,” said Pathak. “We want as many of our decisions to be reversible as possible. We don&#x27;t want to get locked into a decision that we cannot reverse two years from now.”What other builders can learn from Booking.com’s AI journeyBooking.com’s AI journey can serve as an important blueprint for other enterprises. Looking back, Pathak acknowledged that they started out with a “pretty complicated” tech stack. They’re now in a good place with that, “but we probably could have started something much simpler and seen how customers interacted with it.” Given that, he offered this valuable advice: If you’re just starting out with LLMs or agents, out-of-the-box APIs will do just fine. “There&#x27;s enough customization with APIs that you can already get a lot of leverage before you decide you want to go do more.” On the other hand, if a use case requires customization not available through a standard API call, that makes a case for in-house tools. Still, he emphasized: Don&#x27;t start with the complicated stuff. Tackle the “simplest, most painful problem you can find and the simplest, most obvious solution to that.” Identify the product market fit, then investigate the ecosystems, he advised — but don’t just rip out old infrastructures because a new use case demands something specific (like moving an entire cloud strategy from AWS to Azure just to use the OpenAI endpoint). Ultimately: “Don&#x27;t lock yourself in too early,” Pathak noted. “Don&#x27;t make decisions that are one-way doors until you are very confident that that&#x27;s the solution that you want to go with.”",

          "title": "The 5 best Mint alternatives to replace the budgeting app that shut down",
          "standfirst": "It's been over one year since Intuit shut down the popular budgeting app Mint. I was a Mint user for many years; millions of other users like me enjoyed how easily Mint allowed us to track all accounts in one place and monitor credit scores. I also used it regularly to help me track spending, set goals like pay my mortgage down faster and with general money management.Ahead of Mint’s demise, I gave Credit Karma, Intuit’s other financial app, a try but found it to be a poor Mint alternative. So I set out to find a true replacement in another budgeting app. The following guide lays out my experience testing some of the most popular Mint replacement apps available today. Our pick for best Mint alternative remains Quicken Simplifi, even this long after Mint being shut down, thanks to its easy to use app, good income and bill detection and its affordable price. But there are plenty of other solid options out there for those with different needs. If you’re also on the hunt for a budgeting app to replace Mint, we hope these details can empower you to choose which of the best budgeting apps out there will be right for you. Table of contents Best Mint alternatives in 2025 Other Mint alternatives we tested What is Plaid and how does it work? How to import your financial data from the Mint app How we tested Mint alternatives What about Rocket Money? Best Mint alternatives in 2025 No pun intended, but what I like about Quicken Simplifi is its simplicity. Whereas other budgeting apps try to distinguish themselves with dark themes and customizable emoji, Simplifi has a clean user interface, with a landing page that you just keep scrolling through to get a detailed overview of all your stats. These include your top-line balances; net worth; recent spending; upcoming recurring payments; a snapshot of your spending plan; top spending categories; achievements; and any watchlists you’ve set up. Another one of the key features I appreciate is the ability to set up savings goals elsewhere in the app. I also appreciate how it offers neat, almost playful visualizations without ever looking cluttered. I felt at home in the mobile and web dashboards after a day or so, which is faster than I adapted to some competing services (I’m looking at you, YNAB and Monarch). Getting set up with Simplifi was mostly painless. I was particularly impressed at how easily it connected to Fidelity; not all budget trackers do, for whatever reason. This is also one of the only services I tested that gives you the option of inviting a spouse or financial advisor to co-manage your account. One thing I would add to my initial assessment of the app, having used it for a few months now: I wish Simplifi offered Zillow integration for easily tracking your home value (or at least a rough estimate of it). Various competitors including Monarch Money and Copilot Money work with Zillow, so clearly there's a Zillow API available for use. As it stands, Simplifi users must add real estate manually like any other asset. Dana Wollman / Engadget In practice, Simplifi miscategorized some of my expenses, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to any of these budget trackers. As you’re reviewing transactions, you can also mark if you’re expecting a refund, which is a unique feature among the services I tested. Simplifi also estimated my regular income better than some other apps I tested. Most of all, I appreciated the option of being able to categorize some, but not all, purchases from a merchant as recurring. For instance, I can add my two Amazon subscribe-and-saves as recurring payments, without having to create a broad-strokes rule for every Amazon purchase. The budgeting feature is also self-explanatory and can likely accommodate your preferred budgeting method. Just check that your regular income is accurate and be sure to set up recurring payments, making note of which are bills and which are subscriptions. This is important because Simplifi shows you your total take-home income as well as an “income after bills” figure. That number includes, well, bills but not discretionary subscriptions. From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average. Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.” Monarch Money grew on me. My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it's more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it. Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You'll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically. Dana Wollman / Engadget Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch introduced a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph. The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, Monarch expanded on the net worth graph, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time. On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined. Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, MX and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also has a Chrome extension for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data. Additionally, Monarch just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It's not the only one either; currently, Copilot and YNAB have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month. Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn't provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon. Copilot Money might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there. Copilot Money for Web and Android!Thanks to the support from our users, and the overwhelming positive reception we're seeing from folks migrating from Mint, we can now say that we'll be building @copilotmoney for Web and Android with a goal to launch in 2024.We'll continue to…— Andres Ugarte (@chuga) November 15, 2023 There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses. Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing. Dana Wollman / Engadget Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from venmo@venmo.com are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app. While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits. Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well. Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On its website, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year. Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark. You may know NerdWallet as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too. Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA). Dana Wollman / Engadget As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you'll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though. Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says. Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring. Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay). YNAB is, by its own admission, “different from anything you’ve tried before.” The app, whose name is short for You Need a Budget, promotes a so-called zero-based budgeting system, which forces you to assign a purpose for every dollar you earn. A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you. Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting. The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week). My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, penned a respectful rebuttal, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill. Other Mint alternatives we tested PocketGuard PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” How to import your financial data from the Mint app Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data. To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following: Sign into Mint.com and hit Transactions in the menu on the left side of the screen. Select an account, or all accounts. Scroll down and look for “export [number] transactions” in smaller print. Your CSV file should begin downloading. Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts. How we tested Mint alternatives Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a Mint alternative myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html?src=rss",

From there, you can add spending targets by category in the “planned spending” bucket. Planned spending can also include one-time expenditures, not just monthly budgets. When you create a budget, Simplifi will suggest a number based on a six-month average. Not dealbreakers, but two things to keep in mind as you get started: Simplifi is notable in that you can’t set up an account through Apple or Google. There is also no option for a free trial, though Quicken promises a “30-day money back guarantee.” Monarch Money grew on me. My first impression of the budgeting app, which was founded by a former Mint product manager, was that it's more difficult to use than others on this list, including Simplifi, NerdWallet and Copilot. And it is. Editing expense categories, adding recurring transactions and creating rules, for example, is a little more complicated than it needs to be, especially in the mobile app. (My advice: Use the web app for fine-tuning details.) Monarch also didn’t get my income right; I had to edit it. Once you’re set up, though, Monarch offers an impressive level of granularity. In the budgets section, you can see a bona fide balance sheet showing budgets and actuals for each category. You'll also find a forecast, for the year or by month. And recurring expenses can be set not just by merchant, but other parameters as well. For instance, while most Amazon purchases might be marked as “shopping,” those for the amounts of $54.18 or $34.18 are definitely baby supplies, and can be automatically marked as such each time, not to mention programmed as recurring payments. Weirdly, though, there’s no way to mark certain recurring payments as bills, specifically. Dana Wollman / Engadget Not long after I first published this story in December 2023, Monarch introduced a detailed reporting section where you can create on-demand graphs based on things like accounts, categories and tags. That feature is available just on the web version of the app for now. As part of this same update, Monarch added support for an aggregator that makes it possible to automatically update the value of your car. This, combined with the existing Zillow integration for tracking your home value, makes it easy to quickly add a non-liquid asset like a vehicle or real estate, and have it show up in your net worth graph. The mobile app is mostly self-explanatory. The main dashboard shows your net worth; your four most recent transactions; a month-over-month spending comparison; income month-to-date; upcoming bills; an investments snapshot; a list of any goals you’ve set; and, finally, a link to your month-in-review. That month-in-review is more detailed than most, delving into cash flow; top income and expense categories; cash flow trends; changes to your net worth, assets and liabilities; plus asset and liability breakdowns. In February 2024, Monarch expanded on the net worth graph, so that if you click on the Accounts tab you can see how your net worth changed over different periods of time, including one month, three months, six months, a year or all time. On the main screen, you’ll also find tabs for savings and checking accounts (and all others as well), transactions, cash flow, budget and recurring. Like many of the other apps featured here, Monarch can auto-detect recurring expenses and income, even if it gets the category wrong. (They all do to an extent.) Expense categories are marked by emoji, which you can customize if you’re so inclined. Monarch Money uses a combination of networks to connect with banks, including Plaid, MX and Finicity, a competing network owned by Mastercard. (I have a quick explainer on Plaid, the industry standard in this space, toward the end of this guide.) As part of an update in late December, Monarch has also made it easier to connect through those other two networks, if for some reason Plaid fails. Similar to NerdWallet, I found myself completing two-factor authentication every time I wanted to get past the Plaid screen to add another account. Notably, Monarch is the only other app I tested that allows you to grant access to someone else in your family — likely a spouse or financial advisor. Monarch also has a Chrome extension for importing from Mint, though really this is just a shortcut for downloading a CSV file, which you’ll have to do regardless of where you choose to take your Mint data. Additionally, Monarch just added the ability to track Apple Card, Apple Cash, and Savings accounts, thanks to new functionality brought with the iOS 17.4 update. It's not the only one either; currently, Copilot and YNAB have also added similar functionality that will be available to anyone with the latest versions of their respective apps on a device running iOS 17.4. Instead of manually uploading statements, the new functionality allows apps like Monarch's to automatically pull in transactions and balance history. That should make it easier to account for spending on Apple cards and accounts throughout the month. Monarch also recently launched investment transactions in beta. It also says bill tracking and an overhauled goals system are coming soon. Monarch hasn't provided a timeline for that last one, except to say that the improved goals feature is coming soon. Copilot Money might be the best-looking budgeting app I tested. It also has the distinction of being exclusive to iOS and Macs — at least for now. Andres Ugarte, the company’s CEO, has publicly promised that Android and web apps are coming soon. But until it follows through, I can’t recommend Copilot for most people with so many good competitors out there. Copilot Money for Web and Android!Thanks to the support from our users, and the overwhelming positive reception we're seeing from folks migrating from Mint, we can now say that we'll be building @copilotmoney for Web and Android with a goal to launch in 2024.We'll continue to…— Andres Ugarte (@chuga) November 15, 2023 There are other features that Copilot is missing, which I’ll get into. But it is promising, and one to keep an eye on. It’s just a fast, efficient, well designed app, and Android users will be in for a treat when they’ll finally be able to download it. It makes good use of colors, emoji and graphs to help you understand at a glance how you’re doing on everything from your budgets to your investment performance to your credit card debt over time. In particular, Copilot does a better job than almost any other app of visualizing your recurring monthly expenses. Behind those punchy colors and cutesy emoji, though, is some sophisticated performance. Copilot’s AI-powered “Intelligence” gets smarter as you go at categorizing your expenses. (You can also add your own categories, complete with your choice of emoji.) It’s not perfect. Copilot miscategorized some purchases (they all do), but it makes it easier to edit than most. On top of that, the internal search feature is very fast; it starts whittling down results in your transaction history as soon as you begin typing. Dana Wollman / Engadget Copilot is also unique in offering Amazon and Venmo integrations, allowing you to see transaction details. With Amazon, this requires just signing into your Amazon account via an in-app browser. For Venmo, you have to set up fwd@copilot.money as a forwarding address and then create a filter, wherein emails from venmo@venmo.com are automatically forwarded to fwd@copilot.money. Like Monarch Money, you can also add any property you own and track its value through Zillow, which is integrated with the app. While the app is heavily automated, I still appreciate that Copilot marks new transactions for review. It’s a good way to both weed out fraudulent charges, and also be somewhat intentional about your spending habits. Like Monarch Money, Copilot updated its app to make it easier to connect to banks through networks other than Plaid. As part of the same update, Copilot said it has improved its connections to both American Express and Fidelity which, again, can be a bugbear for some budget tracking apps. In an even more recent update, Copilot added a Mint import option, which other budgeting apps have begun to offer as well. Because the app is relatively new (it launched in early 2020), the company is still catching up to the competition on some table-stakes features. Ugarte told me that his team is almost done building out a detailed cash flow section as well. On its website, Copilot also promises a raft of AI-powered features that build on its current “Intelligence” platform, the one that powers its smart expense categorization. These include “smart financial goals,” natural language search, a chat interface, forecasting and benchmarking. That benchmarking, Ugarte tells me, is meant to give people a sense of how they’re doing compared to other Copilot users, on both spending and investment performance. Most of these features should arrive in the new year. Copilot does a couple interesting things for new customers that distinguish it from the competition. There’s a “demo mode” that feels like a game simulator; no need to add your own accounts. The company is also offering two free months with RIPMINT — a more generous introductory offer than most. When it finally does come time to pony up, the $7.92 monthly plan is cheaper than some competing apps, although the $95-a-year-option is in the same ballpark. You may know NerdWallet as a site that offers a mix of personal finance news, explainers and guides. I see it often when I google a financial term I don’t know and sure enough, it’s one of the sites I’m most likely to click on. As it happens, NerdWallet also has the distinction of offering one of the only free budgeting apps I tested. In fact, there is no paid version; nothing is locked behind a paywall. The main catch: There are ads everywhere. To be fair, the free version of Mint was like this, too. Even with the inescapable credit card offers, NerdWallet has a clean, easy-to-understand user interface, which includes both a web and a mobile app. The key metrics that it highlights most prominently are your cash flow, net worth and credit score. (Of note, although Mint itself offered credit score monitoring, most of its rivals do not.) I particularly enjoyed the weekly insights, which delve into things like where you spent the most money or how much you paid in fees — and how that compares to the previous month. Because this is NerdWallet, an encyclopedia of financial info, you get some particularly specific category options when setting up your accounts (think: a Roth or non-Roth IRA). Dana Wollman / Engadget As a budgeting app, NerdWallet is more than serviceable, if a bit basic. Like other apps I tested, you can set up recurring bills. Importantly, it follows the popular 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which has you putting 50% of your budget toward things you need, 30% toward things you want, and the remaining 20% into savings or debt repayments. If this works for you, great — just know that you can’t customize your budget to the same degree as some competing apps. You can’t currently create custom spending categories, though a note inside the dashboard section of the app says “you’ll be able to customize them in the future.” You also can’t move items from the wants column to “needs” or vice versa but “In the future, you'll be able to move specific transactions to actively manage what falls into each group.” A NerdWallet spokesperson declined to provide an ETA, though. Lastly, it’s worth noting that NerdWallet had one of the most onerous setup processes of any app I tested. I don’t think this is a dealbreaker, as you’ll only have to do it once and, hopefully, you aren’t setting up six or seven apps in tandem as I was. What made NerdWallet’s onboarding especially tedious is that every time I wanted to add an account, I had to go through a two-factor authentication process to even get past the Plaid splash screen, and that’s not including the 2FA I had set up at each of my banks. This is a security policy on NerdWallet’s end, not Plaid’s, a Plaid spokesperson says. Precisely because NerdWallet is one of the only budget trackers to offer credit score monitoring, it also needs more of your personal info during setup, including your birthday, address, phone number and the last four digits of your social security number. It’s the same with Credit Karma, which also does credit score monitoring. Related to the setup process, I found that NerdWallet was less adept than other apps at automatically detecting my regular income. In my case, it counted a large one-time wire transfer as income, at which point my only other option was to enter my income manually (which is slightly annoying because I would have needed my pay stub handy to double-check my take-home pay). YNAB is, by its own admission, “different from anything you’ve tried before.” The app, whose name is short for You Need a Budget, promotes a so-called zero-based budgeting system, which forces you to assign a purpose for every dollar you earn. A frequently used analogy is to put each dollar in an envelope; you can always move money from one envelope to another in a pinch. These envelopes can include rent and utilities, along with unforeseen expenses like holiday gifts and the inevitable car repair. The idea is that if you budget a certain amount for the unknowns each month, they won’t feel like they’re sneaking up on you. Importantly, YNAB is only concerned with the money you have in your accounts now. The app does not ask you to provide your take-home income or set up recurring income payments (although there is a way to do this). The money you will make later in the month through your salaried job is not relevant, because YNAB does not engage in forecasting. The app is harder to learn than any other here, and it requires more ongoing effort from the user. And YNAB knows that. Inside both the mobile and web apps are links to videos and other tutorials. Although I never quite got comfortable with the user interface, I did come to appreciate YNAB’s insistence on intentionality. Forcing users to draft a new budget each month and to review each transaction is not necessarily a bad thing. As YNAB says on its website, “Sure, you’ve got pie charts showing that you spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants — but you’ve still spent an obscene amount of money in restaurants.” I can see this approach being useful for people who don’t tend to have a lot of cash in reserve at a given time, or who have spending habits they want to correct (to riff off of YNAB’s own example, ordering Seamless four times a week). My colleague Valentina Palladino, knowing I was working on this guide, penned a respectful rebuttal, explaining why she’s been using YNAB for years. Perhaps, like her, you have major savings goals you want to achieve, whether it’s paying for a wedding or buying a house. I suggest you give her column a read. For me, though, YNAB’s approach feels like overkill. Other Mint alternatives we tested PocketGuard PocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income. Although PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did. What is Plaid and how does it work? Each of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining in its own section what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims. To be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including the budget trackers I tested for this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well. As the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices. In a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.” How to import your financial data from the Mint app Mint users should consider getting their data ready to migrate to their new budgeting app of choice soon. Unfortunately, importing data from Mint is not as easy as entering your credentials from inside your new app and hitting “import.” In fact, any app that advertises the ability to port over your stats from Mint is just going to have you upload a CSV file of transactions and other data. To download a CSV file from Mint, do the following: Sign into Mint.com and hit Transactions in the menu on the left side of the screen. Select an account, or all accounts. Scroll down and look for “export [number] transactions” in smaller print. Your CSV file should begin downloading. Note: Downloading on a per-account basis might seem more annoying, but could help you get set up on the other side, if the app you’re using has you importing transactions one-for-one into their corresponding accounts. How we tested Mint alternatives Before I dove into the world of budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to test, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps they might be using. Some of the apps I found were free, just like Mint. These, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.) Since this guide is meant to help Mint users find a permanent replacement, any services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web. Once I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps (and remember, I really was looking for a Mint alternative myself), I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once. What about Rocket Money? Rocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-best-budgeting-apps-to-replace-mint-143047346.html?src=rss",

          "content": "On Monday, US District Court Judge Patti Saris vacated a Trump executive order that brought a halt to all offshore wind power development, as well as some projects on land. That order had called for the suspension of all permitting for wind power on federal land and waters pending a review of current practices. This led states and an organization representing wind power companies to sue, claiming among other things that the suspension was arbitrary and capricious. Over 10 months since the relevant government agencies were ordered to start a re-evaluation of the permitting process, testimony revealed that they had barely begun to develop the concept of a review. As such, the only reason they could offer in defense of the suspension consisted of Trump’s executive order and a Department of the Interior memo implementing it. “Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice,” Judge Saris wrote, “this is not it.” Lifting Trump’s suspension does not require the immediate approval of any wind projects. Instead, the relevant agencies are likely to continue following Trump’s wishes and slow-walking any leasing and licensing processes, which may force states and project owners to sue individually. But it does provide a legal backdrop for any suits that ultimately occur, one in which the government’s actions have little justification beyond Trump’s personal animosity toward wind power.Read full article Comments",

The Pixel Watch 4 is getting an update that adds several gestures, one of which is straight out of the Apple playbook. When the update hits devices, the Pixel Watch 4 will gain a double pinch gesture like the Apple Watch has. By tapping your thumb and forefinger together, you can answer or end calls, pause timers, and more. The watch will also prompt you at times when you can use the tap gesture to control things. In previous incarnations of Google-powered watches, a quick wrist turn gesture would scroll through lists. In the new gesture system, that motion dismisses what’s on the screen. For example, you can clear a notification from the screen or dismiss an incoming call. Pixel Watch 4 owners will also enjoy this one when the update arrives.Read full article Comments",

A ruling for Trump would give him more power over the FTC and potentially other independent agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission. Former FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democrat, sued Trump after he fired both Democrats from the commission in March. Slaughter’s case rests largely on the 1935 ruling in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court unanimously held that the president can only remove FTC commissioners for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. Chief Justice John Roberts said during yesterday’s oral arguments that Humphrey’s Executor is a “dried husk” despite being the “primary authority” that Slaughter’s legal team is relying on. Roberts said the court’s 2020 ruling in Seila Law made it “pretty clear… that Humphrey’s Executor is just a dried husk of whatever people used to think it was because, in the opinion itself, it described the powers of the agency it was talking about, and they’re vanishingly insignificant, have nothing to do with what the FTC looks like today.”Read full article Comments",

The law began to take shape well before, during the Jair Bolsonaro presidency from 2019 to 2023.

The only snag was that this didn’t match the recipe as described in historical texts. Now the same team is back with a fresh analysis of samples collected from a recently discovered site that confirms the Romans did indeed use hot mixing, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications. As we’ve reported previously, like today’s Portland cement (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient Roman concrete was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder with just a touch of added gypsum to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks. In his treatise De architectura (circa 30 CE), the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius wrote about how to build concrete walls for funerary structures that could endure for a long time without falling into ruin. He recommended the walls be at least two feet thick, made of either “squared red stone or of brick or lava laid in courses.” The brick or volcanic rock aggregate should be bound with mortar composed of hydrated lime and porous fragments of glass and crystals from volcanic eruptions (known as volcanic tephra).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Near the end of the film A House of Dynamite, a fictional American president portrayed by Idris Elba sums up the theory of nuclear deterrence. “Just being ready is the point, right?” Elba says. “It keeps people in check. Keeps the world straight. If they see how prepared we are, no one starts a nuclear war.” There’s a lot that goes wrong in the film, namely the collapse of deterrence itself. For more than 60 years, the US military has used its vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, constantly deployed on Navy submarines, at Air Force bomber bases, and in Minuteman missile fields, as a way of saying, “Don’t mess with us.” In the event of a first strike against the United States, an adversary would be assured of an overwhelming nuclear response, giving rise to the concept of mutual assured destruction.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Nearly a decade after Pebble’s nascent smartwatch empire crumbled, the brand is staging a comeback with new wearables. The Pebble Core Duo 2 and Core Time 2 are a natural evolution of the company’s low-power smartwatch designs, but its next wearable is something different. The Index 01 is a ring, but you probably shouldn’t call it a smart ring. The Index does just one thing—capture voice notes—but the firm says it does that one thing extremely well. Most of today’s smart rings offer users the ability to track health stats, along with various minor smartphone integrations. With all the sensors and data collection, these devices can cost as much as a smartwatch and require frequent charging. The Index 01 doesn’t do any of that. It contains a Bluetooth radio, a microphone, a hearing aid battery, and a physical button. You press the button, record your note, and that’s it. The company says the Index 01 will run for years on a charge and will cost just $75 during the preorder period. After that, it will go up to $99. Core Devices, the new home of Pebble, says the Index is designed to be worn on your index finger (get it?), where you can easily mash the device’s button with your thumb. Unlike recording notes with a phone or smartwatch, you don’t need both hands to create voice notes with the Index.Read full article Comments",

Homan, and unnamed others—Aaron further alleged that US officials made false statements and “unlawful threats” to criminally investigate and prosecute him for developing ICEBlock.Read full article Comments",

The deal includes HBO and the HBO Max streaming service but not WBD’s cable channels, which are to be split off ahead of the acquisition into a separate company called Discovery Global.

          "content": "The 2025 Formula 1 World Championship drew to a close this past weekend in Abu Dhabi, and with it came the end of the current generation of cars. After a grueling 24 races, the title was decided in a three-way fight by the finest of margins; just two points, less than half a percent, separated the winning driver from second place when the checkered flag waved on Sunday. Coming into Abu Dhabi, McLaren’s Lando Norris was, if not a comfortable favorite, then at least the driver with the highest odds of prevailing. After a strong start to the season, the British driver’s form dipped at the Dutch Grand Prix. But he bounced back, retaking the championship lead from his Australian teammate Oscar Piastri in Mexico in October. For much of the season, it seemed to be a two-car race. McLaren had a clear car advantage and two strong drivers, suggesting a repeat of the years we saw Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg duking it out to bring home titles for Mercedes. But that didn’t figure on Red Bull developing its car late in the season. New boss Laurent Mekies has revitalized the energy drinks squad, and four-time champion Max Verstappen was able to close inexorably toward the McLaren drivers in the points with a string of sublime performances.Read full article Comments",

The second best part of video games is taking a puny little character and, over 100 hours, transforming that adventurer into a god of destruction. The best thing about video games is doing the same thing in under an hour. Beat a combat encounter, get an upgrade. Enter a new area, choose a new item. Put together a build and watch it sing. If you die—immediately ending your ascent and returning you to the beginning of the game—you’ll often make a pit stop at a home base to unlock new goodies to help you on your next run. (Some people distiguish between roguelikes and “roguelites,” with the latter including permanent, between-run upgrades. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll use “roguelike” as an umbrella term).Read full article Comments",

After assembling the bike, I set the seatpost to its maximum recommended height, take it on a short test ride, and try to figure out new and creative phrasing to describe the same old problem: The frame isn’t quite big enough to accommodate my legs. While I’m on the tall side at a bit over 6 feet (~190 cm), I’m definitely not abnormally large. Yet very few e-bike manufacturers seem to be interested in giving people my height a comfortable ride. So imagine my surprise when, within two blocks of my first ride on the XPress 750, I had to pull off to the side of the street and lower the seat. This was especially notable given that the XPress is a budget bike (currently on sale for just under $1,000.00) that is only offered in a single frame size. So kudos to Lectric for giving me a comfortable and enjoyable ride, and doing so with a lot of features I wouldn’t expect at this price point. That said, hitting that price necessitated some significant compromises. We’ll discuss those in detail so you can get a sense of whether any of them will get in the way of your riding enjoyment.Read full article Comments",
