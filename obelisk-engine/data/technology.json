Apple’s new, anodized aluminum iPhone 17 Pro phones have drawn attention for reportedly being easy to scratch around the camera “plateau,” and iFixit has investigated the issue in microscopic detail in its teardown video for the phones. Here are some pictures showing just what those scratches look like under a digital microscope: iFixit talked to David Niebuhr, an engineer and professor of mechanical engineering, who has an explanation for why scratches around the iPhone 17 Pro’s camera plateau stick out so much with spalling damage that didn’t appear in tests of other areas. According to Niebuhr, the problem is the sharp edge of the camera bump where the anodization process isn’t as even, as he says, “Apple could have prevented this by making a more gradual curve and avoiding a relatively sharp corner.” iFixit adds that unless you put your iPhone 17 Pro in a case, the camera plateau is “probably going to see some damage” at some point during its lifetime. As for repairability, iFixit gives Apple credit for a screwed-in battery, but criticized requiring users to remove the screen for most repairs — something Apple avoided on the new iPhone Air.",

YouTube parent Alphabet has confirmed that it will restore channels that were banned in recent years for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration. Alphabet made this announcement via a lengthy letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube. For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it \"appreciates the accountability\" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.Read full article Comments",

Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, IT: Welcome to Derry, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut. (Some spoilers below for IT and IT: Chapter Two.) As previously reported, set in 1989, IT essentially adapted half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves \"The Losers Club.\" The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.Read full article Comments",

They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it. New research released earlier this month titled \"We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof\" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3. A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces \"TAAROFBENCH,\" the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.Read full article Comments",

In those early, formative years, the \"Air\" branding denoted not a midrange or entry-level model but an alternate branching path from the baseline MacBook.

          "content": "It's a rare occurrence for scientists to witness sharks mating in the wild. It's even rarer to catch three leopard sharks—two males and one female—engaging in what amounts to a threesome in the wild on camera, particularly since they are considered an endangered species. But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in a paper published in the Journal of Ethology. It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now. Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.Read full article Comments",

While the preliminary injunction can still be appealed, the project is already 80 percent complete, so construction could potentially wrap up while the case is still pending. The Trump administration has made no secret of its animosity toward renewable power and issued early executive orders that blocked further offshore leases and re-evaluated the permitting process for others. But it has also gone beyond that and issued stop-work orders for sites that had already been through the permitting process and were under construction. Its reasons for doing so have been remarkably vague, with suggestions of unspecified flaws to the permitting process that involve everything from environmental impacts to detail-free national security concerns. But those reasons could apparently be ignored under the right circumstances.

Trump fired Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter in March with a notice that said her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration's priorities.\" Trump did so despite the 1935 ruling in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court unanimously held that the president can only remove FTC commissioners for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. An appeals court reinstated Slaughter three weeks ago, with judges finding that \"the government has no likelihood of success on appeal given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent.\" But on September 8, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts granted a stay that temporarily blocked the lower-court ruling against Trump.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Volvo is undergoing something of a restructuring. The automaker wants to be fully electric by 2040, but for that to happen, it needs to remain in business until then. Earlier this year, that meant layoffs, but today, Volvo announced it has big plans for its North American factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina. Volvo has been making cars in South Carolina since 2017, starting with the S60 sedan—a decision I always found slightly curious given that US car buyers had already given up on sedans by that point in favor of crossovers and SUVs. S60 production ended last summer, and these days, the plant builds the large electric EX90 SUV and the related Polestar 3. The company is far from fully utilizing the Ridgeville plant, though, which has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. When the turnaround plan was first announced this July, Volvo revealed it would start building the next midsize XC60 in South Carolina—a wise move given the Trump tariffs and the importance of this model to Volvo's sales figures here.Read full article Comments",

Barring any unforeseen problems, SpaceX will mark the 500th re-flight of a Falcon first stage later this year. A handful of other US companies, including Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and Stoke Space, are on the way to replicating or building on SpaceX's achievements in recycling rocket parts. These launch providers are racing a medley of Chinese rocket builders to become the second company to land and reuse a first stage booster. But it will be many years—perhaps a decade or longer—until anyone else matches the kinds of numbers SpaceX is racking up in the realm of reusable rockets. SpaceX's dominance in this field is one of the most important advantages the United States has over China as competition between the two nations extends into space, US Space Force officials said Monday.Read full article Comments",
