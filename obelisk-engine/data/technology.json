The agency says it has been more than 42 days since a new case was reported in any of the counties that previously showed evidence of ongoing transmission. The outbreak has contributed to the worst year for measles cases in the United States in more than 30 years. As of August 5, the most recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,356 confirmed measles cases have been reported across the country this year. For comparison, there were just 285 measles cases in 2024. The Texas outbreak began in January in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates. More than two-thirds of the state’s reported cases were in children, and two children in Texas died of the virus. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 99 people were hospitalized, representing 13 percent of cases.Read full article Comments",

After saying the Trump administration should deny a Virginia proposal, SpaceX is taking the same approach in a fight against Louisiana. SpaceX made its view known to the Louisiana Office of Broadband Development and Connectivity in a filing, which was reported yesterday by PCMag. SpaceX complained that Louisiana proposed awarding 91.5 percent of funds to fiber Internet service providers instead of to the Starlink satellite system. SpaceX alleged that Louisiana was influenced by \"a legion of fiber lobbyists and other hangers-on seeking to personally benefit from massive taxpayer spending.\" The Trump administration rewrote rules for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program in a way that benefits Starlink. Instead of prioritizing fiber networks that offer better service and are more future-proof, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a \"tech-neutral approach\" and lower the average cost of serving each location.Read full article Comments",

The AAP has been among the most assertive medical groups to push back on the anti-vaccine tactics and actions Kennedy has undertaken as the country's top health official. Those include spreading misinformation about lifesaving vaccines; firing all 17 esteemed CDC vaccine advisors under the false pretense that they had disqualifying conflicts of interest; replacing those advisors with unqualified committee members who share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views; and unilaterally restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines without any evidence-based explanation. Prior to the release of the vaccine schedule, the AAP boycotted the first meeting of Kennedy's hand-selected CDC vaccine advisors in June, saying the committee's work is \"no longer a credible process.\" In July, the organization filed a lawsuit—alongside other medical groups— against the US health department over Kennedy's changes to the federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ancient rituals and customs often leave behind obvious archaeological evidence. From the impeccably preserved mummies of Egypt to psychoactive substance residue that remained at the bottom of a clay vessel for thousands of years, it seems as if some remnants of the past, even if not all are immediately visible, have defied the ravages of time. Chewing betel nuts is a cultural practice in parts of Southeast Asia. When chewed, these reddish nuts, which are the fruit of the areca palm, release psychoactive compounds that heighten alertness and energy, promote feelings of euphoria, and help with relaxation. They are usually wrapped in betel leaves with lime paste made from powdered shells or corals, depending on the region. Critically, the ancient teeth from betel nut chewers are distinguishable because of red staining. So when archaeologist Piyawit Moonkham, of Chiang Mai University in Thailand, unearthed 4,000-year-old skeletons from the Bronze Age burial site of Nong Ratchawat, the lack of telltale red stains appeared to indicate that the individuals they belonged to were not chewers of betel nuts.Read full article Comments",

In our 2024 year-end roundup, Ars senior editor Samuel Axon wrote that the first season gave us \"a specific cocktail of tongue-in-cheek humor, sci-fi campiness, strong themes, great characters, and visceral violence [that] came together into a fantastic show.\" The second season looks like it will bring us more of the same, along with a major new character drawn from the Fallout: New Vegas game. We even got a glimpse of a Deathclaw. (Minor spoilers for S1 below.) For the uninitiated, Fallout is set two centuries after nuclear warfare between the US and China destroyed civilization in 2077—an alternate history version of 2077, in which post-World War II nuclear technology ushered in a retrofuturistic society. Some lucky survivors took refuge in various underground vaults; others were left to scavenge a meager existence on the highly radioactive surface.Read full article Comments",

It has proposed budgets that would be catastrophic, stopped the flow of research funds to a number of universities, and sought to exert unprecedented political control over what funding is distributed. Money has been repeatedly delayed as grants have been checked and rechecked for ideological issues. And all of that is before we get to the instances where the administration has attempted to undermine specific scientific results. But, somewhat unexpectedly, everything isn't currently dark for US-based scientists, as recent budget appropriations in the Senate have ignored Trump's requests (and budget guidance passed by the Senate itself) and have funded research at levels similar to previous years. That funding may ultimately set up a confrontation between a Congress that wants to fund science, and a president who has little interest in doing so—a confrontation the administration appears to be preparing for. Project 2025 and science The president himself appears to be completely indifferent to science, being willing to simply make things up as needed, with no regard for evidence. Instead, most of the attacks on research funding have come from a combination of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The latter is helmed by Russell Vought, who helped produce the Project 2025 document that outlined many of the actions taken by the new administration.Read full article Comments",

One of the latest innovations is the spin serve, a devastatingly effective method in which a player adds a pre-spin just before the racket contacts the shuttlecock (aka the birdie). It's so effective—some have called it \"impossible to return\"—that the Badminton World Federation (BWF) banned the spin serve in 2023, at least until after the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. The sanction wasn't meant to quash innovation but to address players' concerns about the possible unfair advantages the spin serve conferred. The BWF thought that international tournaments shouldn't become the test bed for the technique, which is markedly similar to the previously banned \"Sidek serve.\" The BWF permanently banned the spin serve earlier this year. Chinese physicists have now teased out the complex fundamental physics of the spin serve, publishing their findings in the journal Physics of Fluids. Shuttlecocks are unique among the various projectiles used in different sports due to their open conical shape. Sixteen overlapping feathers protrude from a rounded cork base that is usually covered in thin leather. The birdies one uses for leisurely backyard play might be synthetic nylon, but serious players prefer actual feathers.Read full article Comments",

Smaller than the current model on the outside but with more room inside, it's also more efficient and finally uses a liquid-cooled battery. But we knew all that back at the start of summer. What we didn't know then was how much the Leaf will cost. As we noted back in June, pricing is most likely to determine the Leaf's success or failure. None of the improvements to this electric vehicle will matter if it's too expensive. Happily, that doesn't appear to be the case. The Leaf S+ is the base model, with a 75 kWh long-range battery and a range of 303 miles (487 km)—it will cost $29,990 when it goes on sale this fall. That makes it cheaper than the original car when it first went on sale back in 2011, and that's before taking inflation into account. \"We've stuck to our mission of engineering EVs that are affordable but packed with value. That's how we've kept the LEAF's price steady over three generations—all while giving owners more style, more technology, more features and a vastly improved driving range over the original 2011 model,\" said Nissan Senior Vice President of US Marketing and Sales Vinay Shahani.Read full article Comments",

That eruption brought diamonds that formed deep within the Earth's mantle to the surface, where they now wait in the soil for anyone with a garden trowel and patience. The Crater of Diamonds site hosted multiple commercial mining attempts between 1906 (when John Wesley Huddleston found the first diamonds) and the park's opening in 1972. Several companies tried to make the operation profitable but failed due to the relatively low concentration of diamonds compared to commercial mines elsewhere.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The folks at Raspberry Pi have announced a new touchscreen component for people using boards to create miniature touchscreen appliances: The 5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 is a 720p IPS multi-touch screen that's natively supported by the Raspberry Pi OS and includes mounting holes on the back to make it easy to build integrated all-in-one devices. The new screen will cost $40 and is available starting today from Pi resellers like CanaKit, Vilros, and PiShop (though some of those retailers already list it slightly above the MSRP). \"Its capacitive touch screen works out of the box with full Linux driver support—no manual calibration required, no hunting through device trees, and no wrestling with incompatible touch controllers,\" writes Raspberry Pi software CTO Gordon Hollingworth in the company's blog post.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ostensibly, C:\\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia! There are a couple of reasons I chose The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall this time around: its co-creator, Julian LeFay, recently passed away, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then. But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to Daggerfall, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.Read full article Comments",

And while I could just claim to be too busy to spend hours on Newegg or Amazon or other sites digging through dozens of near-identical parts, the lack of updates usually correlates with \"times when building a desktop PC is actually a pain in the ass.\" Through most of 2025, fluctuating and inflated graphics card pricing and limited availability have once again conspired to make a normally fun hobby an annoying slog—and honestly kind of a bad way to spend your money, relative to just buying a Steam Deck or something and ignoring your desktop for a while. But three things have brought me back for another round. First, GPU pricing and availability have improved a little since early 2025. Second, as unreasonable as pricing is for PC parts, pre-built PCs with worse specs and other design compromises are unreasonably priced, too, and people should have some sense of what their options are. And third, I just have the itch—it's been a while since I built (or helped someone else build) a PC, and I need to get it out of my system.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Every dog owner knows that canines are natural scavengers and that vigilance is required to ensure they don't eat toxic substances. But accidental ingestions still happen—like the Chihuahua who vets discovered had somehow managed to ingest a significant quantity of cocaine, according to a case study published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science. There have been several studies investigating the bad effects cocaine can have on the cardiovascular systems of both humans and animals. However, these controlled studies are primarily done in laboratory settings and often don't match the messier clinical realities. \"Case reports are crucial in veterinary medicine by providing real-world examples,\" said co-author Jake Johnson of North Carolina State University. \"They capture clinical scenarios that larger studies might miss, preserve unusual presentations for future reference, and help build our collective understanding of rare presentations, ultimately improving emergency preparedness and treatment protocols.\" In the case of a 2-year-old male Chihuahua, the dog presented as lethargic and unresponsive. His owners had found him with his tongue sticking out and unable to focus visually. The Chihuahua was primarily an outdoor dog but was also allowed inside, and all its vaccines were up to date. Examination revealed bradycardia, i.e., a slow heart rate, a blue tinge to the dog's mucus membranes—often a sign of too much unoxygenated hemoglobin circulating through the system—and dilated pupils. The dog's symptoms faded after the vet administered a large dose of atropine, followed by epinephrine.Read full article Comments",
