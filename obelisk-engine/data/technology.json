Language can be confusing, but typically when something is available to \"buy,\" ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content. Often, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.Read full article Comments",

This announcement may represent an effort to move away from dependence on OpenAI, despite Microsoft's substantial investment in that company. It comes more than a year after insider reports revealed that Microsoft was beginning work on its own foundational models. A post on the Microsoft AI blog describes two models. MAI-Voice-1 is a natural speech-generation model meant to deliver \"high-fidelity, expressive audio across both single and multi-speaker scenarios.\" The idea is that voice will be one of the main ways users interact with AI tools in the future, though we haven't really seen that come to fruition so far. The second model is called MAI-1-preview, and it's a foundational large language model specifically trained to drive Copilot, Microsoft's AI chatbot tool. It was trained on around 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, and runs inference on a single GPU. As reported last year, this model is significantly larger than the models seen in Microsoft's earlier experiments, which focused on smaller models meant to run locally, like Phi-3.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr. ousted the agency's director, Susan Monarez, who had just weeks ago been confirmed by the Senate and earned Kennedy's praise for her \"unimpeachable scientific credentials.\" It appears those scientific chops are what led to her swift downfall. Since the Department of Health and Human Services announced on X late Wednesday that \"Susan Monarez is no longer director\" of the CDC, media reports have revealed that her forced removal was over her refusal to bend to Kennedy's anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda. The ouster appeared to be a breaking point for the agency overall, which has never fully recovered from the public pummeling it received at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its weakened position, the agency has since endured an onslaught of further criticism, vilification, and misinformation from Kennedy and the Trump administration, which also delivered brutal cuts, significantly slashing CDC's workforce, shuttering vital health programs, and hamstringing others. Earlier this month, a gunman, warped by vaccine misinformation, opened fire on the CDC's campus, riddling its buildings with hundreds of bullets, killing a local police officer, and traumatizing agency staff.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "At the beginning of the month, Tesla was found partly liable in a wrongful death lawsuit involving the death of a pedestrian in Florida in 2019. The automaker—which could have settled the case for far less—claimed that it did not have the fatal crash's data. That's until a hacker was able to recover it from the crashed car, according to a report in The Washington Post. In the past, Tesla has been famously quick to offer up customer data stored on its servers to rebut claims made against the company. But in this case, the company said it had nothing. Specifically, the lawyers for the family wanted what's known as the \"collision snapshot,\" data captured by the car's cameras and other sensors in the seconds leading up to and after the crash. According to the trial, moments after the collision snapshot was uploaded to Tesla's servers, the local copy on the car was marked for deletion. Then, \"someone at Tesla probably took 'affirmative action to delete' the copy of the data on the company’s central database,\" according to the Post.Read full article Comments",

That's around two months after the first Windows builds with the 25H2 label were released to the other preview channels. Putting a new yearly Windows update in the Release Preview channel is analogous to the \"release to manufacturing\" (RTM) phase of years past, back when updates shipped on physical media that needed to be manufactured. Build numbers for this version of Windows start with 26200, rather than 24H2's 26100. The 25H2 update doesn't do a lot in and of itself, other than reset the clock for Microsoft's security updates (each yearly release gets two years of security patches). Microsoft says that last year's 24H2 update and this year's 25H2 update \"use a shared servicing branch,\" which mostly means that there aren't big under-the-hood differences between the two. Installing the 25H2 update on a PC may enable some features on your 24H2 PC that had already been installed but had been disabled by default.Read full article Comments",

That decision proved controversial among players who weren't able to get the finicky low-level security setting working on their machines and others who were unwilling to allow EA's anti-cheat tools to once again have kernel-level access to their systems. Now, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl is defending that requirement as something of a necessary evil to combat cheaters, even as he apologizes to any potential players that it has kept away. \"The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot,\" Buhl said in an interview with Eurogamer. \"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play: that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things.\"Read full article Comments",

The company completed its first successful Starship test flight in nearly a year, and while it wasn't perfect, it sets up SpaceX for far more ambitious tests ahead. SpaceX's workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, launched six times since our last edition of the Rocket Report. Many of these missions were noteworthy in their own right, including the launch of the US military's X-37B spaceplane, an upgraded Dragon capsule to boost the International Space Station to a higher orbit, and the record 30th launch and landing of a flight-proven Falcon 9 booster.

Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Firefly announces cause of Alpha launch failure. Firefly Aerospace closed the investigation into the failure of one of its Alpha rockets during an April mission for Lockheed Martin and received clearance from the FAA to resume launches, Payload reports. The loss of the launch vehicle was a dark cloud hanging over the company’s otherwise successful IPO this month. The sixth flight of Firefly's Alpha rocket launched in April from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, and failed when its first stage booster broke apart milliseconds after stage separation. This created a shockwave that destroyed the engine nozzle extension on the second stage, damaging the engine before the second stage ran out of propellant seconds before it attained orbital velocity. Both stages ultimately fell into the Pacific Ocean.Read full article Comments",

For people who miss the days of low-cost, tinkering-friendly Nexus phones, Google's vision is moving ever further away from that, but the attention to detail and overall polish of the Pixel experience continue with the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. These are objectively good phones with possibly the best cameras on the market, and they're also a little more powerful, but the aesthetics are seemingly locked down. Google made a big design change last year with the Pixel 9 series, and it's not reinventing the wheel in 2025. The Pixel 10 series keeps the same formula, making limited refinements, not all of which will be well-received. Google pulled out all the stops and added a ton of new AI features you may not care about, and it killed the SIM card slot. Just because Apple does something doesn't mean Google has to, but here we are. If you're still clinging to your physical SIM card or just like your Pixel 9, there's no reason to rush out to upgrade. A great but not so daring design If you liked the Pixel 9's design, you'll like the Pixel 10, because it's a very slightly better version of the same hardware. All three phones are made from aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (no titanium option here). The base model has a matte finish on the metal frame with a glossy rear panel, and it's the opposite on the Pro phones. This makes the more expensive phones a little less secure in the hand—those polished edges are slippery. The buttons on the Pixel 9 often felt a bit loose, but the buttons on all our Pixel 10 units are tight and clicky.Read full article Comments",

The design has already reached 5,000 supporters, and it has 320 days left to reach the 10,000-supporter benchmark required to be reviewed by Lego. With its personality-forward aesthetics and Jony Ive-led design, the original iMac was the first step down the path that led to blockbuster products like the iPod and iPhone. It was the company's first all-new Mac design after CEO Steve Jobs returned to the company in the late '90s, and while it lacked some features included in contemporary PCs, its tightly integrated design and ease of setup helped it stand out against the beige desktop PCs of the day. Today's colorful Apple Silicon iMacs are clearly inspired by the original design.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Today's video game consoles are hundreds of dollars more expensive than you'd expect based on historic pricing trends. That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases. The overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been increasing the nominal MSRP for many current consoles in the past six months. If the original Switch followed historic pricing trends, it could be selling for a bargain basement $100 to $150 right now.

Credit: Kyle Orland Despite cratering Xbox hardware sales, Microsoft has been unwilling to cut prices on Xbox consoles. Credit: Kyle Orland But when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.Read full article Comments",
