The NCMEC’s CyberTipline is a Congressionally authorized clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other forms of child exploitation. Companies are required by law to report apparent child exploitation to the CyberTipline. When a company sends a report, NCMEC reviews it and then forwards it to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation. Statistics related to NCMEC reports can be nuanced. Increased reports can sometimes indicate changes in a platform’s automated moderation, or the criteria it uses to decide whether a report is necessary, rather than necessarily indicating an increase in nefarious activity.Read full article Comments",

According to Reuters, the lawsuit was filed alongside five other writers who all claim big tech companies have been violating their intellectual property rights in the name of building large language models.

Just about every type of entity that deals in protected content has gone to court against AI companies this year, from movie studios like Disney and Warner Bros. to papers like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.

This is also the first case of its kind to list xAI as a defendant. A spokesperson for Perplexity told Reuters that the company \"doesn't index books.\" Anthropic, for its part, is no stranger to lawsuits from book publishers, having recently settled a class-action lawsuit brought by half a million authors for $1.5 billion.

For iOS 26.3, Apple's devices will support third-party proximity pairing and notifications in Europe only, according to the latest beta notes. That will make it a bit easier to connect devices like Sony headphones or receive notifications from an iPhone on Wear OS smartwatches — provided manufacturers support the new feature. \"The DMA creates new opportunities for developers to bring to market innovative products and services in Europe,\" an EU spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal. \"This is another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens.\" The EU Commission added that the functionality will be \"fully available\" in the bloc in 2026. The new capabilities are as follows: Proximity pairing - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an iPhone or iPad to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps. Notifications - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the ‌iPhone‌. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch. Proximity pairing is a relatively minor quality-of-life upgrade, allowing you to connect with a tap via NFC rather than diving into the Bluetooth settings. However, there's no indication that it will allow seamless switching between devices as you can do with Apple's iPods, for instance. Notifications, however, will finally make third-party watches feasible with iOS devices. Apple's DMA compliance efforts are interesting to watch, as it appears to be doing the bare minimum required, often for what it calls privacy reasons.

          "standfirst": "Want to see a dead body? I present to you the Xbox. After a subdued launch at the height of the COVID pandemic in 2020, the Xbox Series X quickly lost the fight against the PlayStation 5. Microsoft simply couldn't deliver enough compelling games, despite some huge acquisitions, while Sony leaned on its goodwill from the PS4 era and a handful of desirable exclusives. As prices rose due to supply chain issues and the Trump administration's volatile tariff scheme, there was even less of a reason to get an Xbox (even the cheaper Series S). When I re-reviewed the Series X last year, it was clear that it never lived up to its potential. Anyone in their right mind would be better off buying a PlayStation 5.Xbox didn't enter 2025 in a great state, and it's leaving the year grasping for help, like an Arc Raider player desperate for a revival after being knocked out. Microsoft cancelled the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, two of the most interesting games in its weak upcoming slate. The company brought titles like Forza Horizon 5 over to the PlayStation 5, which prompted Engadget Deputy Editor Nathan Ingraham to declare he no longer needed an Xbox. Xbox Series X controllerEngadgetMaking things worse this year, Microsoft raised prices across the board, with the Xbox Series S starting at $400 and the cheapest Series X going for a whopping $600. And slow sales prompted Costco to stop selling Xbox consoles entirely. Microsoft didn't even try to push systems during Black Friday — why go through the trouble of having sales if nobody is buying the hardware in the first place? Even Game Pass, which was once renowned as one of the best deals in gaming, almost doubled in price over the last year, reaching up to $30 a month (or $360 a year) for the Ultimate tier. Sure, Microsoft tried to add more value to its cheaper Game Pass tiers, and finally upgraded its cloud streaming platform, but the lack of consistent must-play exclusive titles has devalued the service (and Xbox as a whole). Avowed and South of Midnight were among the few exclusive highlights, but the latter will hit PS5 and Switch 2 next year. There's no word on Avowed reaching other consoles yet, but given Microsoft's current trajectory (and the fact that it's a genuinely great game), I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes available elsewhere.There was a chance for Microsoft to reinvigorate the Xbox brand with the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X gaming handhelds, but the $600 and $1,000 launch prices placed them out of reach for most gamers. It also doesn't help that Windows still isn't well-optimized for portable devices with touchscreens, and those systems also aren't compatible with older Xbox titles like the consoles. At the very least, Microsoft now has a handheld foothold. But a future portable Xbox console would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with the likes of the Steam Deck, which starts at $549 (following the discontinuation of the $400 LCD model).And speaking of Valve, the company's recently announced Steam Machine has also stolen a lot of potential thunder from Xbox. The Steam Machine is basically a tiny gaming desktop for your TV, running the Steam Deck's SteamOS. That platform is a Linux distribution optimized for emulating Windows titles. But unlike an Xbox console, it's not closed off in any way. You're free to install whatever you'd like on a Steam Machine — even Windows!While we still haven't seen the Steam Machine in action, the Steam Deck's excellent performance and game compatibility makes me think its desktop sibling could be genuinely compelling to console players looking for something new. And it will likely directly compete with the next Xbox, which is rumored to arrive in 2027 as a PC in a TV-friendly case (according to Windows Central's Jez Corden). Microsoft's recent partnership deal with AMD also hints at a more PC-like experience — Xbox President Sarah Bond noted that the Xbox team is \"working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.\"It's worth remembering that only a single generation of the Xbox — the Xbox 360 — was successful enough to truly compete with Sony's PlayStation. The original Xbox reportedly cost Microsoft $4 billion over the course of four years, leading the company to quickly jump ship and move to its successor. The Xbox 360 was genuinely innovative, thanks to Xbox Live and smarter online integration, and it had a healthy amount of third-party support. In comparison, Sony's PlayStation 3 was $100 to $200 more expensive than the Xbox 360 at launch, it had far worse online support and developers found it hard to program for.Xbox Series XDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetUnfortunately, Microsoft squandered most of its good will with the Xbox One. That console was first announced as an \"always online\" device with restrictive DRM features that limited how you could share and sell games; it was bundled with a Kinect camera that could potentially surveil you; and at $499, it was $100 more than the PlayStation 4. Microsoft quickly reversed many of its DRM-heavy plans for the Xbox One, but by that point the damage was done. Sony ultimately sold more than twice as many PS4 units as the entirety of the Xbox One family (which included the cheaper One S and more powerful One X), according to data from Ampere Research. Things are looking worse this generation: The Xbox Series S and X reportedly only sold around 33 million units as of July, according to Statista estimates, while Sony confirmed it sold 84.2 million PS5s as of November. If this trend continues (and it doesn’t appear as if Xbox sales will be increasing any time soon), Sony could end up selling three times as many consoles this generation, compared to Microsoft. Xbox sales have been so slow that the family-focused Nex Playground managed to outsell it in November, according to data from Circana. Given Xbox's inability to compete with the PlayStation 5, it's no wonder Microsoft could be changing things up entirely for its next system. Its partnership with AMD could easily lead to new handhelds, and it also gives Microsoft a leg up in producing a compact and powerful Xbox PC. After all, why should the company keep trying to go toe-to-toe with Sony's closed PlayStation platform? Why shouldn't Microsoft embrace its PC roots to give us a gaming desktop under our TVs? The company has already committed to bringing new Xbox games to PCs immediately, so the line between the two is already blurring. It may be a risk, but evolving into a PC proves there’s still life in the Xbox brand. And crucially, it’s also something Sony can’t easily replicate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Want to see a dead body? I present to you the Xbox. After a subdued launch at the height of the COVID pandemic in 2020, the Xbox Series X quickly lost the fight against the PlayStation 5. Microsoft simply couldn't deliver enough compelling games, despite some huge acquisitions, while Sony leaned on its goodwill from the PS4 era and a handful of desirable exclusives. As prices rose due to supply chain issues and the Trump administration's volatile tariff scheme, there was even less of a reason to get an Xbox (even the cheaper Series S). When I re-reviewed the Series X last year, it was clear that it never lived up to its potential. Anyone in their right mind would be better off buying a PlayStation 5.Xbox didn't enter 2025 in a great state, and it's leaving the year grasping for help, like an Arc Raider player desperate for a revival after being knocked out. Microsoft cancelled the Perfect Dark reboot and Everwild, two of the most interesting games in its weak upcoming slate. The company brought titles like Forza Horizon 5 over to the PlayStation 5, which prompted Engadget Deputy Editor Nathan Ingraham to declare he no longer needed an Xbox. Xbox Series X controllerEngadgetMaking things worse this year, Microsoft raised prices across the board, with the Xbox Series S starting at $400 and the cheapest Series X going for a whopping $600. And slow sales prompted Costco to stop selling Xbox consoles entirely. Microsoft didn't even try to push systems during Black Friday — why go through the trouble of having sales if nobody is buying the hardware in the first place? Even Game Pass, which was once renowned as one of the best deals in gaming, almost doubled in price over the last year, reaching up to $30 a month (or $360 a year) for the Ultimate tier. Sure, Microsoft tried to add more value to its cheaper Game Pass tiers, and finally upgraded its cloud streaming platform, but the lack of consistent must-play exclusive titles has devalued the service (and Xbox as a whole).

          "title": "CES 2026: Everything we're expecting from tech's biggest conference in January",
          "standfirst": "As we hurtle towards the end of the year, the shadow of CES hovers on the horizon. Tech’s biggest annual conference is starting in just under two weeks, and we already know some of the products and announcements that could be in store. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the CTA’s schedule we also do know what companies will be hosting press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its \"Innovation in Tune with You\" presentation to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence\" at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.On the week of December 15, the CTA added a keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to its schedule. The event will take place on January 5 at 1PM PT and, according to the website, will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.”Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. As they typically do, some companies have already gotten a headstart on the CES news by publicly sharing their announcements in the weeks leading up to January. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control.Not to be forgotten, Samsung also announced it will be launching a whole lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

          "standfirst": "Giving a child an Apple Watch can offer extra peace of mind and tools that promote independence in a controlled way. Apple’s Family Setup feature makes it possible for a kid to use an Apple Watch without owning an iPhone, and the feature set has expanded thanks to recent watchOS updates. It supports communication controls, location tools, Schooltime limits and privacy protections that allow a parent or guardian to manage how the device is used throughout the day. The setup process begins with creating or signing in with a child’s Apple ID. It continues with adding them to your Family Sharing group on an iPhone and pairing a compatible Apple Watch through the Apple Watch app. Once the watch is linked, you can adjust a range of parental controls that shape how the watch works at home, at school and when the child is out and about. Confirm device compatibility Family Setup requires a cellular-capable Apple Watch such as the Apple Watch SE or Series 6 or later. A cellular connection allows the watch to operate independently without an iPhone nearby. The watch must be running a recent version of watchOS and the iPhone used for setup must be running the latest iOS version. If the watch is not new, it needs to be erased before it can pair with a new user. This can be done directly on the watch through the Settings menu by choosing the general reset option. Once the device is reset it can be paired again from the Apple Watch app. Create or prepare your child's Apple ID Family Setup relies on each child having their own Apple ID. This allows their data, messages, activity goals and device settings to remain separate from other people in the household. If your kid already has an Apple ID, it can be used during setup. If they do not have one, the Apple Watch app will prompt you to create one as you go through the pairing process. A child’s Apple ID is linked to Family Sharing, which lets the organizer manage permissions from a single iPhone. A parent or guardian can approve contacts, handle screen time requests and view location updates without needing to touch the watch itself. Setting this up first ensures that the watch can be paired smoothly later. Add the child to Family Sharing Family Sharing is the foundation for managing the watch, and it’s all controlled through the Settings app on your iPhone. Once Family Sharing is open you can tap the option to add a family member then follow the prompts to link the child’s Apple ID to the group. This also makes you the family organizer, which gives you control of purchase approvals, communication limits and other shared features. Once the child is added to Family Sharing their information becomes available when you begin pairing the Apple Watch. This makes the process faster since the watch can immediately associate itself with the correct Apple ID. Pair the watch using Family Setup Turn on the Apple Watch and place it near your iPhone. A prompt should appear directing you to use your iPhone for setup. If the prompt does not appear, you can open the Apple Watch app, go to All Watches and choose Add Watch. The app will then ask if the device is being set up for you or for a family member. Choose the family member option and continue. The camera on your iPhone is used to pair the devices. Align the Apple Watch face inside the frame on your screen until the pairing animation is recognized. Once the connection is made the app will ask which family member the watch is for. Select the child’s profile to continue through the remaining steps. The app will guide you through choosing which wrist the watch will be worn on, setting a passcode, signing in with the child’s Apple ID and enabling services such as Siri and location tracking. You can also set up activity goals tailored to the child’s age and fitness level. Manage the watch from your iPhone Once the Apple Watch is paired, the Watch app becomes the main place to manage how it works. The Family Setup interface is designed to give parents and guardians control without needing to handle the watch directly. Most adjustments can be made at any time from the iPhone used for setup. Screen Time controls allow you to set limits for communication and app use. You can restrict access to certain features during specific times of day, create downtime schedules and manage content restrictions for websites and apps. These settings mirror the Screen Time system used on other Apple devices which makes it easier to keep rules consistent across the household. Approved contacts can be managed through the communication limits menu. This ensures that the child can send messages and make calls only with approved people. If you add or remove contacts, they are updated instantly on the watch. Location sharing is handled through the Find My app. You can view the child’s location and set notifications that alert you when they arrive at or leave a particular place. This is useful for school pickups or after-school activities. The watch uses on-device processing for location and messages which helps maintain privacy. Configure Schooltime and Focus modes School time is one of the most important parental controls for younger users. It limits interaction with the watch during school hours by locking access to most apps and features. Only the time and a simple yellow icon appear on the screen while Schooltime is active. You can schedule Schooltime from the Apple Watch app so that it automatically turns on and off at the right times each day. Focus modes offer another layer of control. These modes can reduce distractions during homework, bedtime or other family routines. Each Focus mode can limit notifications and activity alerts so the child is not interrupted when they need to concentrate. Set up safety features Emergency SOS is enabled during setup and can be managed afterward in the Apple Watch app. It allows the child to contact emergency services by holding the side button. You can also assign an emergency contact who will receive a notification if SOS is triggered. The Medical ID should include relevant details such as allergies or medical conditions. This information can be accessed by emergency responders if needed. Adjust privacy and communication settings The watch uses on-device processing for messages, location and Siri requests which helps protect your child’s data. Location sharing can be turned on or off at any time and you can manage which apps are allowed to use location services. Communication permissions can also be updated as the child’s needs change. Apps installed on the watch can be controlled from the Apple Watch app. You can remove apps, restrict access or hide notifications at any time to maintain a balanced experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-set-up-an-apple-watch-for-a-child-120051230.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Upgrading to a good SSD can make your computer feel brand new again. Apps open faster, files move in a blink and even older machines start to feel a lot more responsive. It is one of the easiest ways to breathe life into a laptop or desktop without replacing the whole system, and the performance boost is something you notice right away.There are plenty of SSDs to choose from, though, and the naming alone can be confusing if you are not already familiar with the specs. Some drives are built for simple upgrades, while others offer speeds that benefit creators or gamers. To help you sort through it, we tested a wide mix of options and pulled together the best SSDs you can buy right now. Table of contents Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs What to look for in a PC SSD What to look for in portable and USB flash drives A note on console storage SSD FAQs Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs I’ve either tested or personally use daily every storage drive recommended on this list. Out of our top picks, I bought four with my own money after doing about a dozen hours of research. Separately, Engadget Senior Reporter Jeff Dunn has also tested a handful of our recommendations, including the Crucial X9 Pro listed above. What to look for in a PC SSD The most affordable way to add fast storage space to a computer is with a 2.5-inch SATA drive. It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, the best SATA SSDs are an excellent choice if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply. The one downside of SATA drives is that, in terms of responsiveness, they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD will be significantly faster than the best mechanical drives. And with high-capacity, 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk-storage option. If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest SSDs on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved. M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. These drives rely on NVMe NAND technology for their superior performance and durability. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard. If you’re running an AMD system, that means at least a Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPU and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need at least an 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind that Gen4 SSDs typically cost more than their Gen3 counterparts as well. More expensive still are the latest Gen5 models, which offer sequential read speeds of up to 16,000MB/s. However, even if your computer supports the standard, you’re better off buying a more affordable Gen4 or Gen3 drive. At the moment, very few games and applications can take advantage of Gen3 NVMe speeds, let alone Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. What’s more, Gen5 NVMe drives can run hot, which can lead to performance and longevity issues. Your money is better spent on other components, like upgrading your GPU, for now. As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier. Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe. One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters and the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation or firmware before buying a drive to ensure you’re picking up a compatible size. If you’re buying a replacement SSD for the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED, things are less complicated. For Valve’s handheld, you will need a 2230 size NVMe. Simple. If you don’t want to open your Steam Deck, it’s also possible to expand its storage by installing a microSD card. Engadget has a separate guide dedicated to SD card storage, so check that out for additional buying advice. I alluded to this earlier, but the best buying advice I can offer is don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance benchmark tests vary less than you think. If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a higher gigabyte capacity in the future. What to look for in portable and USB flash drives Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the SanDisk Extreme Pro V2 without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The best external hard drives also allow you to transfer data from your Windows PC to a Mac, or other device, if compatible. Be sure to consider this beforehand if you plan to use your portable drive across multiple devices. Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives, including the Samsung SSD T7 Shield, with a high endurance rating. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD. Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best budget external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption. A note on console storage Seagate If PC gaming isn’t your thing and you own an Xbox Series X|S or PS5, outfitting your fancy new console with the fastest possible storage is far more straightforward than doing the same on PC. With a Series X or Series S, your options are limited to options from Seagate and Western Digital. The former offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB models, with the most affordable starting at a not-so-trivial $90. Western Digital’s Expansion Cards are less expensive, with pricing starting at $80 for the 512GB model. The good news is that both options are frequently on sale. Your best bet is to set an alert for the model you want by using a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel. With Sony’s PlayStation 5, upgrading the console’s internal storage is slightly more involved. Instead of employing a proprietary solution, the PS5 uses NVMe storage. Thankfully, there aren’t as many potential configurations as you would find on a PC. Engadget maintains a comprehensive guide to the best SSDs for PS5; in short, your best bet is a high-capacity Gen4 drive with a built-in heatsink. Check out that guide for a full list of gaming SSD recommendations, but for a quick go-to, consider the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX I recommend above. It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Corsair offers 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB versions of the drive. Expect to pay about $110 for the 1TB variant and about $200 for 2TB. For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles and updating your operating system instead. SSD FAQs What size SSD is best? There is no one size fits all rule for SSDs, but we generally recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD if you’re looking to upgrade PC or game console storage, or looking to add an external drive to your toolkit. A 1TB drive will be plenty for most people who need extra storage space for photos, documents and programs. If you’re a hardcore gamer, you may want to invest in even more storage considering many high-profile titles today can take up a ton of space. Is a 256GB SSD better than a 1TB hard drive? The short answer is that it depends on what you need your drive for. In general, SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs, but HDDs are usually cheaper. We recommend springing for an SSD for most use cases today — upgrading a PC, saving important photos and documents, storing games long term, etc. But if you’re focused on getting the most amount of extra space possible (and sticking to a budget), an HDD could be a good option for you. Does bigger SSD mean faster? Getting a bigger SSD doesn’t always translate into a faster drive overall. A bigger SSD will provide a higher storage capacity, which means more space for storing digital files and programs. To understand how fast an SSD will be, you’ll want to look at its read/write speeds: read speeds measure how fast a drive can access information, while write speeds measure how fast the drive can save information. Most SSDs list their approximate read/write speeds in their specs, so be sure to check out those numbers before you make a purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss",

It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, the best SATA SSDs are an excellent choice if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply. The one downside of SATA drives is that, in terms of responsiveness, they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD will be significantly faster than the best mechanical drives. And with high-capacity, 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk-storage option. If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest SSDs on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved. M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. These drives rely on NVMe NAND technology for their superior performance and durability. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard. If you’re running an AMD system, that means at least a Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPU and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need at least an 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind that Gen4 SSDs typically cost more than their Gen3 counterparts as well. More expensive still are the latest Gen5 models, which offer sequential read speeds of up to 16,000MB/s. However, even if your computer supports the standard, you’re better off buying a more affordable Gen4 or Gen3 drive. At the moment, very few games and applications can take advantage of Gen3 NVMe speeds, let alone Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. What’s more, Gen5 NVMe drives can run hot, which can lead to performance and longevity issues. Your money is better spent on other components, like upgrading your GPU, for now. As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier. Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe. One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters and the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation or firmware before buying a drive to ensure you’re picking up a compatible size. If you’re buying a replacement SSD for the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED, things are less complicated. For Valve’s handheld, you will need a 2230 size NVMe. Simple. If you don’t want to open your Steam Deck, it’s also possible to expand its storage by installing a microSD card. Engadget has a separate guide dedicated to SD card storage, so check that out for additional buying advice. I alluded to this earlier, but the best buying advice I can offer is don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance benchmark tests vary less than you think. If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a higher gigabyte capacity in the future. What to look for in portable and USB flash drives Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the SanDisk Extreme Pro V2 without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The best external hard drives also allow you to transfer data from your Windows PC to a Mac, or other device, if compatible. Be sure to consider this beforehand if you plan to use your portable drive across multiple devices. Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives, including the Samsung SSD T7 Shield, with a high endurance rating. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD. Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best budget external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption. A note on console storage Seagate If PC gaming isn’t your thing and you own an Xbox Series X|S or PS5, outfitting your fancy new console with the fastest possible storage is far more straightforward than doing the same on PC. With a Series X or Series S, your options are limited to options from Seagate and Western Digital. The former offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB models, with the most affordable starting at a not-so-trivial $90. Western Digital’s Expansion Cards are less expensive, with pricing starting at $80 for the 512GB model. The good news is that both options are frequently on sale. Your best bet is to set an alert for the model you want by using a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel. With Sony’s PlayStation 5, upgrading the console’s internal storage is slightly more involved. Instead of employing a proprietary solution, the PS5 uses NVMe storage. Thankfully, there aren’t as many potential configurations as you would find on a PC. Engadget maintains a comprehensive guide to the best SSDs for PS5; in short, your best bet is a high-capacity Gen4 drive with a built-in heatsink. Check out that guide for a full list of gaming SSD recommendations, but for a quick go-to, consider the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX I recommend above. It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Corsair offers 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB versions of the drive. Expect to pay about $110 for the 1TB variant and about $200 for 2TB. For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles and updating your operating system instead. SSD FAQs What size SSD is best? There is no one size fits all rule for SSDs, but we generally recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD if you’re looking to upgrade PC or game console storage, or looking to add an external drive to your toolkit. A 1TB drive will be plenty for most people who need extra storage space for photos, documents and programs. If you’re a hardcore gamer, you may want to invest in even more storage considering many high-profile titles today can take up a ton of space. Is a 256GB SSD better than a 1TB hard drive? The short answer is that it depends on what you need your drive for. In general, SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs, but HDDs are usually cheaper. We recommend springing for an SSD for most use cases today — upgrading a PC, saving important photos and documents, storing games long term, etc. But if you’re focused on getting the most amount of extra space possible (and sticking to a budget), an HDD could be a good option for you. Does bigger SSD mean faster? Getting a bigger SSD doesn’t always translate into a faster drive overall. A bigger SSD will provide a higher storage capacity, which means more space for storing digital files and programs. To understand how fast an SSD will be, you’ll want to look at its read/write speeds: read speeds measure how fast a drive can access information, while write speeds measure how fast the drive can save information. Most SSDs list their approximate read/write speeds in their specs, so be sure to check out those numbers before you make a purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss",

          "title": "While everyone talks about an AI bubble, Salesforce quietly added 6,000 enterprise customers in 3 months",
          "standfirst": "While Silicon Valley debates whether artificial intelligence has become an overinflated bubble, Salesforce&#x27;s enterprise AI platform quietly added 6,000 new customers in a single quarter — a 48% increase that executives say demonstrates a widening gap between speculative AI hype and deployed enterprise solutions generating measurable returns.Agentforce, the company&#x27;s autonomous AI agent platform, now serves 18,500 enterprise customers, up from 12,500 the prior quarter. Those customers collectively run more than three billion automated workflows monthly and have pushed Salesforce&#x27;s agentic product revenue past $540 million in annual recurring revenue, according to figures the company shared with VentureBeat. The platform has processed over three trillion tokens — the fundamental units that large language models use to understand and generate text — positioning Salesforce as one of the largest consumers of AI compute in the enterprise software market.\"This has been a year of momentum,\" Madhav Thattai, Salesforce&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer for AI, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We crossed over half a billion in ARR for our agentic products, which have been out for a couple of years. And so that&#x27;s pretty remarkable for enterprise software.\"The numbers arrive amid intensifying scrutiny of AI spending across corporate America. Venture capitalists and analysts have questioned whether the billions pouring into AI infrastructure — from data centers to graphics processing units to model development — will ever generate proportionate returns. Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon have committed tens of billions to AI infrastructure, prompting some investors to ask whether the enthusiasm has outpaced the economics.Yet the Salesforce data suggests that at least one segment of the AI market — enterprise workflow automation — is translating investments into concrete business outcomes at a pace that defies the bubble narrative.Why enterprise AI trust has become the defining challenge for CIOs in 2025The distinction between AI experimentation and AI deployment at scale comes down to one word that appeared repeatedly across interviews with Salesforce executives, customers, and independent analysts: trust.Dion Hinchcliffe, who leads the CIO practice at technology research firm The Futurum Group, said the urgency around enterprise AI has reached a fever pitch not seen in previous technology cycles. His firm recently completed a comprehensive analysis of agentic AI platforms that ranked Salesforce slightly ahead of Microsoft as the market leader.\"I&#x27;ve been through revolution after revolution in this business,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before. In my entire career, I&#x27;ve never seen this level of business focus—boards of directors are directly involved, saying this is existential for the company.\"The pressure flows downward. CIOs who once managed technology as a cost center now field questions directly from board members demanding to know how their companies will avoid being disrupted by AI-native competitors.\"They&#x27;re pushing the CIO hard, asking, &#x27;What are we doing? How do we make sure we&#x27;re not put out of business by the next AI-first company that reimagines what we do?&#x27;\" Hinchcliffe said.But that pressure creates a paradox. Companies want to move fast on AI, yet the very autonomy that makes AI agents valuable also makes them dangerous. An agent that can independently execute workflows, process customer data, and make decisions without human intervention can also make mistakes at machine speed — or worse, be manipulated by bad actors.This is where enterprise AI platforms differentiate themselves from the consumer AI tools that dominate headlines. According to Hinchcliffe, building a production-grade agentic AI system requires hundreds of specialized engineers working on governance, security, testing, and orchestration — infrastructure that most companies cannot afford to build themselves.\"The average enterprise-grade agentic team is 200-plus people working on an agentic platform,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"Salesforce has over 450 people working on agent AI.\"Early in the AI adoption cycle, many CIOs attempted to build their own agent platforms using open-source tools like LangChain. They quickly discovered the complexity exceeded their resources.\"They very quickly realized this problem was much bigger than expected,\" Hinchcliffe explained. \"To deploy agents at scale, you need infrastructure to manage them, develop them, test them, put guardrails on them, and govern them — because you&#x27;re going to have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of long-running processes out there doing work.\"How AI guardrails and security layers separate enterprise platforms from consumer chatbotsThe technical architecture that separates enterprise AI platforms from consumer tools centers on what the industry calls a \"trust layer\" — a set of software systems that monitor, filter, and verify every action an AI agent attempts to take.Hinchcliffe&#x27;s research found that only about half of the agentic AI platforms his firm evaluated included runtime trust verification — the practice of checking every transaction for policy compliance, data toxicity, and security violations as it happens, rather than relying solely on design-time constraints that can be circumvented.\"Salesforce puts every transaction, without exception, through that trust layer,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"That&#x27;s best practice, in our view. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated system checking policy compliance, toxicity, grounding, security, and privacy on every agentic activity, you can&#x27;t roll it out at scale.\"Sameer Hasan, who serves as Chief Technology and Digital Officer at Williams-Sonoma Inc., said the trust layer proved decisive in his company&#x27;s decision to adopt Agentforce across its portfolio of brands, which includes Pottery Barn, West Elm, and the flagship Williams-Sonoma stores that together serve approximately 20% of the U.S. home furnishings market.\"The area that caused us to make sure—let&#x27;s be slow, let&#x27;s not move too fast, and let this get out of control—is really around security, privacy, and brand reputation,\" Hasan said. \"The minute you start to put this tech in front of customers, there&#x27;s the risk of what could happen if the AI says the wrong thing or does the wrong thing. There&#x27;s plenty of folks out there that are intentionally trying to get the AI to do the wrong thing.\"Hasan noted that while the underlying large language models powering Agentforce — including technology from OpenAI and Anthropic — are broadly available, the enterprise governance infrastructure is not.\"We all have access to that. You don&#x27;t need Agentforce to go build a chatbot,\" Hasan said. \"What Agentforce helped us do more quickly and with more confidence is build something that&#x27;s more enterprise-ready. So there&#x27;s toxicity detection, the way that we handle PII and PII tokenization, data security and creating specific firewalls and separations between the generative tech and the functional tech, so that the AI doesn&#x27;t have the ability to just go comb through all of our customer and order data.\"The trust concerns appear well-founded. The Information reported that among Salesforce&#x27;s own executives, trust in generative AI has actually declined — an acknowledgment that even insiders recognize the technology requires careful deployment.Corporate travel startup Engine deployed an AI agent in 12 days and saved $2 millionFor Engine, a corporate travel platform valued at $2.1 billion following its Series C funding round, the business case for Agentforce crystallized around a specific customer pain point: cancellations.Demetri Salvaggio, Engine&#x27;s Vice President of Customer Experience and Operations, said his team analyzed customer support data and discovered that cancellation requests through chat channels represented a significant volume of contacts — work that required human agents but followed predictable patterns.Engine deployed its first AI agent, named Eva, in just 12 business days. The speed surprised even Salvaggio, though he acknowledged that Engine&#x27;s existing integration with Salesforce&#x27;s broader platform provided a foundation that accelerated implementation.\"We saw success right away,\" Salvaggio said. \"But we went through growing pains, too. Early on, there wasn&#x27;t the observability you&#x27;d want at your fingertips, so we were doing a lot of manual work.\"Those early limitations have since been addressed through Salesforce&#x27;s Agentforce Studio, which now provides real-time analytics showing exactly where AI agents struggle with customer questions — data that allows companies to continuously refine agent behavior.The business results, according to Salvaggio, have been substantial. Engine reports approximately $2 million in annual cost savings attributable to Eva, alongside a customer satisfaction score improvement from 3.7 to 4.2 on a five-point scale — an increase Salvaggio described as \"really cool to see.\"\"Our current numbers show $2 million in cost savings that she&#x27;s able to address for us,\" Salvaggio said. \"We&#x27;ve seen CSAT go up with Eva. We&#x27;ve been able to go from like a 3.7 out of five scale to 4.2. We&#x27;ve had some moments at 85%.\"Perhaps more telling than the cost savings is Engine&#x27;s philosophy around AI deployment. Rather than viewing Agentforce as a headcount-reduction tool, Salvaggio said the company focuses on productivity and customer experience improvements.\"When you hear some companies talk about AI, it&#x27;s all about, &#x27;How do I get rid of all my employees?&#x27;\" Salvaggio said. \"Our approach is different. If we can avoid adding headcount, that&#x27;s a win. But we&#x27;re really focused on how to create a better customer experience.\"Engine has since expanded beyond its initial cancellation use case.

Traditional chatbots feel robotic, impersonal, and limited — good at answering simple questions but incapable of the nuanced guidance a knowledgeable store associate might provide.\"We&#x27;ve all had experiences with chatbots, and more often than not, they&#x27;re not positive,\" Hasan said. \"Historically, chatbot capabilities have been pretty basic. But when customers come to us with a service question, it&#x27;s rarely that simple — &#x27;Where&#x27;s my order?&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s here.&#x27; &#x27;Great, thanks.&#x27; It&#x27;s far more nuanced and complex.\"Williams-Sonoma&#x27;s AI agent, called Olive, goes beyond answering questions to actively engaging customers in conversations about entertaining, cooking, and lifestyle — the same consultative approach the company&#x27;s in-store associates have provided for decades.\"What separates our brands from others in the industry—and certainly from the marketplaces—is that we&#x27;re not just here to sell you a product,\" Hasan said. \"We&#x27;re here to help you, educate you, elevate your life. With Olive, we can connect the dots.\"The agent draws on Williams-Sonoma&#x27;s proprietary recipe database, product expertise, and customer data to provide personalized recommendations. A customer planning a dinner party might receive not just product suggestions but complete menu ideas, cooking techniques, and entertaining tips.Thattai, the Salesforce AI executive, said Williams-Sonoma is in what he describes as the second stage of agentic AI maturity. The first stage involves simple question-and-answer interactions. The second involves agents that actually execute business processes. The third — which he said is the largest untapped opportunity — involves agents working proactively in the background.Critically, Hasan said Williams-Sonoma does not attempt to disguise its AI agents as human. Customers know they&#x27;re interacting with AI.\"We don&#x27;t try to hide it,\" Hasan said. \"We know customers may come in with preconceptions. I&#x27;m sure plenty of people are rolling their eyes thinking, &#x27;I have to deal with this AI thing&#x27;—because their experience with other companies has been that it&#x27;s a cost-cutting maneuver that creates friction.\"The company surveys customers after AI interactions and benchmarks satisfaction against human-assisted interactions. According to Hasan, the AI now matches human benchmarks — a constraint the company refuses to compromise.\"We have a high bar for service—a white-glove customer experience,\" Hasan said. \"AI has to at least maintain that bar. If anything, our goal is to raise it.\"Williams-Sonoma moved from pilot to full production in 28 days, according to Salesforce — a timeline that Thattai said demonstrates how quickly companies can deploy when they build on existing platform infrastructure rather than starting from scratch.The three stages of enterprise AI maturity that determine whether companies see ROIBeyond the headline customer statistics, Thattai outlined a three-stage maturity framework that he said describes how most enterprises approach agentic AI:Stage one involves building simple agents that answer questions — essentially sophisticated chatbots that can access company data to provide accurate, contextual responses. The primary challenge at this stage is ensuring the agent has comprehensive access to relevant information.Stage two involves agents that execute workflows — not just answering \"what time does my flight leave?\" but actually rebooking a flight when a customer asks. Thattai cited Adecco, the recruiting company, as an example of stage-two deployment. The company uses Agentforce to qualify job candidates and match them with roles — a process that involves roughly 30 discrete steps, conditional decisions, and interactions with multiple systems.\"A large language model by itself can&#x27;t execute a process that complex, because some steps are deterministic and need to run with certainty,\" Thattai explained. \"Our hybrid reasoning engine uses LLMs for decision-making and reasoning, while ensuring the deterministic steps execute with precision.\"Stage three — and the one Thattai described as the largest future opportunity — involves agents working proactively in the background without customer initiation. He described a scenario in which a company might have thousands of sales leads sitting in a database, far more than human sales representatives could ever contact individually.\"Most companies don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to reach out and qualify every one of those customers,\" Thattai said. \"But if you use an agent to refine profiles and personalize outreach, you&#x27;re creating incremental opportunities that humans simply don&#x27;t have the capacity for.\"Salesforce edges out Microsoft in analyst rankings of enterprise AI platformsThe Futurum Group&#x27;s recent analysis of agentic AI platforms placed Salesforce at the top of its rankings, slightly ahead of Microsoft. The report evaluated ten major platforms — including offerings from AWS, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, and UiPath — across five dimensions: business value, product innovation, strategic vision, go-to-market execution, and ecosystem alignment.Salesforce scored above 90 (out of 100) across all five categories, placing it in what the firm calls the \"Elite\" zone. Microsoft trailed closely behind, with both companies significantly outpacing competitors.Thattai acknowledged the competitive pressure but argued that Salesforce&#x27;s existing position in customer relationship management provides structural advantages that pure-play AI companies cannot easily replicate.\"The richest and most critical data a company has — data about their customers — lives within Salesforce,\" Thattai said. \"Most of our large customers use us for multiple functions: sales, service, and marketing. That complete view of the customer is central to running any business.\"The platform advantage extends beyond data. Salesforce&#x27;s existing workflow infrastructure means that AI agents can immediately access business processes that have already been defined and refined — a head start that requires years for competitors to match.\"Salesforce is not just a place where critical data is put, which it is, but it&#x27;s also where work is performed,\" Thattai said. \"The process by which a business runs happens in this application — how a sales process is managed, how a marketing process is managed, how a customer service process is managed.\"Why analysts say 2026 will be the real year of AI agents in the enterpriseDespite the momentum, both Salesforce executives and independent analysts cautioned that enterprise AI remains in early innings.Hinchcliffe pushed back against the notion that 2025 was \"the year of agents,\" a phrase that circulated widely at the beginning of the year.\"This was not the year of agents,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"This was the year of finding out how ready they were, learning the platforms, and discovering where they weren&#x27;t mature yet. The biggest complaint we heard was that there&#x27;s no easy way to manage them. Once companies got all these agents running, they realized: I have to do lifecycle management. I have agents running on old versions, but their processes aren&#x27;t finished. How do I migrate them?\"He predicted 2026 has \"a much more likely chance of being the year of agents,\" though added that the \"biggest year of agents\" is \"probably going to be the year after that.\"The Futurum Group&#x27;s analysis forecasts the AI platform market growing from $127 billion in 2024 to $440 billion by 2029 — a compound annual growth rate that dwarfs most enterprise software categories.For companies still on the sidelines, Salvaggio offered pointed advice based on Engine&#x27;s early-adopter experience.\"Don&#x27;t take the fast-follower strategy with this technology,\" he said. \"It feels like it&#x27;s changing every week. There&#x27;s a differentiation period coming — if it hasn&#x27;t started already — and companies that waited are going to fall behind those that moved early.\"He warned that institutional knowledge about AI deployment is becoming a competitive asset in itself — expertise that cannot be quickly acquired through outside consultants.\"Companies need to start building AI expertise into their employee base,\" Salvaggio said. \"You can&#x27;t outsource all of this — you need that institutional knowledge within your organization.\"Thattai struck a similarly forward-looking note, drawing parallels to previous platform shifts.\"Think about the wave of mobile technology—apps that created entirely new ways of interacting with companies,\" he said. \"You&#x27;re going to see that happen with agentic technology. The difference is it will span every channel — voice, chat, mobile, web, text — all tied together by a personalized conversational experience.\"The question for enterprises is no longer whether AI agents will transform customer and employee experiences. The data from Salesforce&#x27;s customer base suggests that transformation is already underway, generating measurable returns for early adopters willing to invest in platform infrastructure rather than waiting for a theoretical bubble to burst.\"I feel incredibly confident that point solutions in each of those areas are not the path to getting to an agentic enterprise,\" Thattai said. \"The platform approach that we&#x27;ve taken to unlock all of this data in this context is really the way that customers are going to get value.\"",
          "content": "While Silicon Valley debates whether artificial intelligence has become an overinflated bubble, Salesforce&#x27;s enterprise AI platform quietly added 6,000 new customers in a single quarter — a 48% increase that executives say demonstrates a widening gap between speculative AI hype and deployed enterprise solutions generating measurable returns.Agentforce, the company&#x27;s autonomous AI agent platform, now serves 18,500 enterprise customers, up from 12,500 the prior quarter. Those customers collectively run more than three billion automated workflows monthly and have pushed Salesforce&#x27;s agentic product revenue past $540 million in annual recurring revenue, according to figures the company shared with VentureBeat. The platform has processed over three trillion tokens — the fundamental units that large language models use to understand and generate text — positioning Salesforce as one of the largest consumers of AI compute in the enterprise software market.\"This has been a year of momentum,\" Madhav Thattai, Salesforce&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer for AI, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We crossed over half a billion in ARR for our agentic products, which have been out for a couple of years. And so that&#x27;s pretty remarkable for enterprise software.\"The numbers arrive amid intensifying scrutiny of AI spending across corporate America. Venture capitalists and analysts have questioned whether the billions pouring into AI infrastructure — from data centers to graphics processing units to model development — will ever generate proportionate returns. Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon have committed tens of billions to AI infrastructure, prompting some investors to ask whether the enthusiasm has outpaced the economics.Yet the Salesforce data suggests that at least one segment of the AI market — enterprise workflow automation — is translating investments into concrete business outcomes at a pace that defies the bubble narrative.Why enterprise AI trust has become the defining challenge for CIOs in 2025The distinction between AI experimentation and AI deployment at scale comes down to one word that appeared repeatedly across interviews with Salesforce executives, customers, and independent analysts: trust.Dion Hinchcliffe, who leads the CIO practice at technology research firm The Futurum Group, said the urgency around enterprise AI has reached a fever pitch not seen in previous technology cycles. His firm recently completed a comprehensive analysis of agentic AI platforms that ranked Salesforce slightly ahead of Microsoft as the market leader.\"I&#x27;ve been through revolution after revolution in this business,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before. In my entire career, I&#x27;ve never seen this level of business focus—boards of directors are directly involved, saying this is existential for the company.\"The pressure flows downward. CIOs who once managed technology as a cost center now field questions directly from board members demanding to know how their companies will avoid being disrupted by AI-native competitors.\"They&#x27;re pushing the CIO hard, asking, &#x27;What are we doing? How do we make sure we&#x27;re not put out of business by the next AI-first company that reimagines what we do?&#x27;\" Hinchcliffe said.But that pressure creates a paradox. Companies want to move fast on AI, yet the very autonomy that makes AI agents valuable also makes them dangerous. An agent that can independently execute workflows, process customer data, and make decisions without human intervention can also make mistakes at machine speed — or worse, be manipulated by bad actors.This is where enterprise AI platforms differentiate themselves from the consumer AI tools that dominate headlines. According to Hinchcliffe, building a production-grade agentic AI system requires hundreds of specialized engineers working on governance, security, testing, and orchestration — infrastructure that most companies cannot afford to build themselves.\"The average enterprise-grade agentic team is 200-plus people working on an agentic platform,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"Salesforce has over 450 people working on agent AI.\"Early in the AI adoption cycle, many CIOs attempted to build their own agent platforms using open-source tools like LangChain. They quickly discovered the complexity exceeded their resources.\"They very quickly realized this problem was much bigger than expected,\" Hinchcliffe explained. \"To deploy agents at scale, you need infrastructure to manage them, develop them, test them, put guardrails on them, and govern them — because you&#x27;re going to have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of long-running processes out there doing work.\"How AI guardrails and security layers separate enterprise platforms from consumer chatbotsThe technical architecture that separates enterprise AI platforms from consumer tools centers on what the industry calls a \"trust layer\" — a set of software systems that monitor, filter, and verify every action an AI agent attempts to take.Hinchcliffe&#x27;s research found that only about half of the agentic AI platforms his firm evaluated included runtime trust verification — the practice of checking every transaction for policy compliance, data toxicity, and security violations as it happens, rather than relying solely on design-time constraints that can be circumvented.\"Salesforce puts every transaction, without exception, through that trust layer,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"That&#x27;s best practice, in our view. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated system checking policy compliance, toxicity, grounding, security, and privacy on every agentic activity, you can&#x27;t roll it out at scale.\"Sameer Hasan, who serves as Chief Technology and Digital Officer at Williams-Sonoma Inc., said the trust layer proved decisive in his company&#x27;s decision to adopt Agentforce across its portfolio of brands, which includes Pottery Barn, West Elm, and the flagship Williams-Sonoma stores that together serve approximately 20% of the U.S. home furnishings market.\"The area that caused us to make sure—let&#x27;s be slow, let&#x27;s not move too fast, and let this get out of control—is really around security, privacy, and brand reputation,\" Hasan said. \"The minute you start to put this tech in front of customers, there&#x27;s the risk of what could happen if the AI says the wrong thing or does the wrong thing.

          "standfirst": "The Nintendo Switch 2 supports a wide range of controllers, from Nintendo’s own Pro Controller to many Bluetooth gamepads you might already have. Whether you’re setting up your new console for the first time or adding extra controllers for multiplayer games, pairing them is simple as long as you know where to look. Here’s how to connect the Switch 2 Pro Controller, how to sync additional Bluetooth controllers and what to do if something doesn’t pair correctly.Before you start: What you’ll needTo pair any controller with the Switch 2 you’ll need the console powered on and updated to the latest system software. Navigate to System Settings, System then System Update to check. It also helps to have the controller charged, since some models need enough battery to begin pairing.On the Switch 2, all controller settings reside in the Controllers & Sensors section of System Settings. You can pair up to four controllers depending on the game and the controller type.How to pair the Switch 2 Pro ControllerNintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller is the simplest device to connect, and it can be paired in two different ways: wired and wireless. If you’re setting it up for the first time, the wired method is the fastest and most reliable.To pair the Switch 2 Pro Controller using a USB cable:Connect the Pro Controller to the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable.Wake the console and open the Controllers menu from the Home screen.The console will automatically detect the controller and pair it.Once the controller is paired, you can unplug the cable and continue using it wirelessly. This method ensures an instant connection and is useful if the controller has low battery.To pair wirelessly:Turn on the Switch 2 and navigate to System Settings, Controllers & Sensors then Change Grip/Order.Press and hold the small Sync button on top of the Pro Controller until the indicator lights begin flashing.The Switch 2 will detect the controller and confirm the pairing.How to pair other Bluetooth controllers to Switch 2The Switch 2 supports a wide range of Bluetooth controllers, including many gamepads designed for PC, Android and iOS devices. Pairing these controllers uses a similar process, but you’ll start by putting the controller into Bluetooth pairing mode.Each controller handles this differently. On most models, you’ll hold a dedicated sync button or press a combination of buttons until lights begin flashing. If you’re not sure which buttons to press, check the controller’s manual.On the Switch 2, navigate to the Home Menu and select Controllers then Change Grip/Order. This page is always used for wireless pairing. The console will search for available Bluetooth devices as soon as it opens.Once your controller appears on the screen, select it to finish the pairing process. The lights on the controller should stop blinking and settle into an assigned player slot. Some controllers may prompt you to confirm the button layout or adjust settings after pairing.The Switch 2 can use up to four wireless controllers at once. For local multiplayer games, each controller will automatically be assigned a player number once connected.Troubleshooting pairing issuesIf your controller doesn’t appear in the pairing menu, make sure Bluetooth is enabled on the Switch 2 by navigating to System Settings then Controllers & Sensors. It’s also worth restarting the controller and checking that it has enough battery to stay in pairing mode. Moving closer to the console can help reduce interference as well. If you’re trying to connect a controller that supports multiple device profiles, verify that it’s set to Nintendo Switch mode or a standard Bluetooth gamepad mode.With Pro Controllers, a wired connection usually solves pairing problems. Plug the controller into the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable and allow it to sync before trying wireless mode again.Reconnecting paired controllersOnce you’ve paired a controller, reconnecting it is as simple as pressing any button. The Switch 2 will wake and recognize it automatically as long as the controller is still linked to the console. If you pair the controller with another device later, you may need to repeat the pairing process.Pairing controllers with the Switch 2 is quick once you know where the settings live. The Pro Controller offers the most seamless experience, especially if you start with a wired connection, but the console’s Bluetooth support gives you plenty of flexibility for multiplayer games or different play styles.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-pair-controllers-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000126.html?src=rss",

Even though it was chunky and heavy, had a tiny exterior display and suffered from a hinge that let too much detritus inside (which is probably how The Verge’s review unit got wrecked), it still showed so much promise.

In 2025, two phones in particular brought major upgrades to foldables as a whole.

Now, for all the folks out there with regular phones, that might not sound like a big deal. But on devices with complicated hinges where you really don't want random garbage getting inside, that's a massive relief and a big improvement to the handset's general usability.

In fact, if you compared the Z Fold 7 to Samsung's other flagship — the S25 Ultra — the fold is actually a touch lighter (7.58 ounces vs 7.69 ounces) and practically just as thin (8.9mm vs 8.2mm). That's huge because one of the biggest issues with previous generations of foldables was excess bulk and heft, to the point where often I had to wear a belt just so my pants wouldn't sag when carrying one around. Unfortunately, there isn't a phone maker that has put both of these advancements into a single gadget just yet. But this is still a big deal, and based on how things are trending, I'm sure that won't be the case for long.What about the crease, you say? Yes, even the latest and greatest foldables still have a small depression that runs down the screen where the phone bends in half. Let me be clear: that's not really an issue. Sure, it would be nice if it weren't there, but getting mad about the crease is kind of like being annoyed at a convertible car that has some extra panel gaps because it has a retractable roof.

          "standfirst": "A tight budget does not mean you have to settle for a slow or outdated laptop. Many affordable models today offer solid performance for work, classes and everyday browsing, and some even pack in extras like bright displays or long battery life. Whether you need something for school, travel or streaming, there are plenty of budget laptops that deliver more value than you might expect.Since the options can be overwhelming, we tested a wide range of devices to find the best budget laptops that offer dependable performance without stretching your wallet. Table of contents The best cheap laptops of 2026 What to look for in a budget laptop A note about refurbished laptops The best cheap laptops of 2026 What to look for in a budget laptop First, we at Engadget consider anything under $1,000 to be “budget” in the laptop space. The reason for this is twofold: even the most affordable flagship laptops typically start at $1,000 or more, and if you go dramatically lower than that (say, $500 or less), that’s where you’ll really start to see compromises in performance. You’ll typically find the best cheap laptops striking a good balance between power and price in the $500 to $1,000 range. But in this guide, we’ll cover top picks at a wide range of prices — there are a number of excellent options on the low and high end of the budget spectrum. Arguably the biggest thing to look for in a cheap laptop is build quality and a decent spec sheet. You might be able to find configuration options with the latest generation CPU chipsets, or you may have to go for one that has a slightly older processor. We recommend looking for models with solid state drive (SSD) storage instead of a traditional hard drive, as SSDs provide faster performance. And if you can find a PC with the latest internals, it’s worth the investment. However, going with a CPU that’s just one generation behind likely won’t make a noticeable difference in performance. Along with processors, you should also consider the amount of memory and storage you need in a daily driver. For the former, we recommend laptops with at least 8GB of RAM; anything with less than that will have a hard time multitasking and managing all those web browsing tabs. The latter is a bit more personal: how much onboard storage you need really depends on how many apps, files, photos, documents and more you will save locally. As a general rule of thumb, try to go for a laptop that has at least a 256GB SSD (this only goes for macOS and Windows machines, as Chromebooks are a bit different). That should give you enough space for programs and files, plus room for future operating system updates. And if you need a machine for light productivity or Android emulation, some laptops even support Android apps natively, which can add extra versatility. After determining the best performance you can get while sticking to your budget, it’s also worth examining a few different design aspects. We recommend a laptop with an IPS display for better viewing angles and color accuracy, though premium models with OLED displays are becoming more common and can offer deeper blacks and vibrant colors. Pay attention to port selection, too — many budget models offer plenty of ports, while higher-end ones tend to prioritize minimalism with fewer connections. If connectivity matters to you, look for options with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and an audio jack. And speaking of practical features, keep an eye on GPU performance if you're shopping for a budget-friendly gaming laptop. While integrated graphics are fine for casual users, a dedicated GPU will improve gaming and creative workloads. We also recommend checking the refresh rate of the screen, as a higher rate will make a noticeable difference in both games and scrolling-heavy apps. A note about refurbished laptops Refurbished laptops are another option to consider if you need a new machine and don’t want to spend a ton of money. Buying refurbished tech can be tricky if you’re unfamiliar with a brand’s or merchant’s policies surrounding what they classify as “refurbished.” But it’s not impossible — for laptops, we recommend going directly to the manufacturer for refurbished devices. Apple, Dell and Microsoft all have official refurbishment processes that their devices go through before they’re put back on the market that verifies the machines work properly and are in good condition. Third-party retailers like Amazon and Walmart also have their own refurbishment programs for laptops and other gadgets as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss",

          "title": "From assistance to autonomy: How agentic AI is redefining enterprises",
          "standfirst": "Presented by EdgeVerveArtificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to change the way enterprises operate. For years, the focus was on assistants, systems that could surface information, summarize documents, or streamline repetitive tasks. While valuable, these technological assistants were reactive: they waited for human prompts and provided limited support within narrow boundaries.Today, a new chapter is unfolding. Agentic AI, whose systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step orchestration, represents a significant evolution. These systems don’t just assist, they act. They evaluate context, weigh outcomes and autonomously initiate actions, orchestrating complex workflows across functions. They adapt dynamically and collaborate with other agents in ways that are beginning to reshape enterprise operations at large. For leaders, this shift carries both opportunity and responsibility. The potential is immense, but so are the governance, trust and design challenges that come with giving AI systems greater autonomy. Enterprises must be able to monitor and override any actions taken by the agentic AI systems.Shift from assistance to autonomyTraditional AI assistants primarily respond to queries and perform isolated tasks. They are helpful but constrained. Agentic AI pushes further: multiple agents can collaborate, exchange context and manage workflows end-to-end.Imagine a procurement workflow. An assistant can pull vendor data or draft a purchase order. An agentic system, however, can review demand forecasts, evaluate vendor risk, check compliance policies, negotiate terms and finalize transactions. It does this all while coordinating across global business departments, including finance, operations and compliance.This shift from narrow support to autonomous orchestration is the defining leap of the next era of enterprise AI. It is not about replacing humans but about embedding intelligence into the very fabric of organizational workflows.Rethink enterprise workflows The goal of every enterprise department is focused on efficiency, scale and standardization. But agentic AI challenges enterprises to think differently. Instead of designing workflows step by step and inserting automation, organizations now need to completely reimagine and architect intelligent ecosystems for orchestrating processes, adapting to evolving business needs, and enabling seamless collaboration between humans and agents.That requires new thinking. Which decisions should remain human-led, and which can be delegated? How do you ensure agents access the correct data without overstepping boundaries? What happens when agents from finance, HR and supply chain must coordinate autonomously?The design of workflows is no longer about linear handoffs; it is about orchestrated ecosystems. Enterprises that get this right can achieve speed and agility that traditional automation cannot match.Accelerate agentic AI-led transformation with a unified platformIn this environment, unified platforms become critical. Without them, enterprises risk a proliferation of disconnected agents working at cross-purposes. A unified approach provides the guardrails with shared knowledge graphs, consistent policy frameworks and a single orchestration layer that ensures interoperability across business functions.This platform-based approach not only reduces complexity but also enables scale. Enterprises don’t want dozens of fragmented AI projects that stall in the pilot stages. They want enterprise-grade systems where agents can collaborate securely and consistently across the enterprise.Unified platforms simplify outcome monitoring and strengthen governance —both critical as systems become increasingly autonomous.Build trust and accountabilityAs AI systems act with greater independence, the stakes rise. An agent who makes flawed decisions in customer service may frustrate a client. An agent that mishandles a compliance process could expose the enterprise to regulatory risk.That’s why trust and accountability must be designed into agentic AI from the start. Governance is not an afterthought; it is a foundation. Leaders need clear policies defining the scope of agentic autonomy, transparent logging of decisions, evaluating and monitoring agents and escalation mechanisms when human oversight is required.Equally important is cultural trust. Employees must believe these systems are partners, not threats. This calls for change management, training, and communication that positions agentic AI as augmenting human capability rather than replacing it.Measure business value earlyOne of the most common pitfalls in enterprise AI adoption is the gap between promising pilots and at-scale results. Studies show that a significant percentage of AI projects never make it past experimentation. Agentic AI cannot afford to fall into this trap.Enterprises must measure business value early and continuously. This includes efficiency gains, cost reductions, error avoidance and even intangible benefits like faster decision-making or improved compliance. Success will be defined by automation coverage across processes, reductions in manual intervention and the ability to deliver new services at speed and scale.When designed responsibly, agentic AI can deliver exponential improvements. A procurement cycle reduced from weeks to hours, or a compliance review automated at scale, can fundamentally alter enterprise performance.Preparing for the futureThe rise of agentic AI does not mean handing over control to machines or codes. Instead, it marks the next phase of enterprise transformation, where humans and agents operate side by side in orchestrated systems.Leaders should start by piloting agentic systems in well-defined domains with clear governance models. From there, scaling across the enterprise requires investment in unified platforms, robust policy frameworks, and a culture that embraces intelligent automation as a partner in value creation.The enterprises that succeed will be those that approach agentic AI not as another tool, but as a strategic shift. Just as ERP and cloud once redefined operations, agentic AI is poised to do the same, reshaping workflows, governance, and the very way decisions are made.Agentic AI is moving the enterprise conversation from assistance to autonomy. That change comes with objective complexity, but also with extraordinary promise.

          "content": "Presented by EdgeVerveArtificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to change the way enterprises operate. For years, the focus was on assistants, systems that could surface information, summarize documents, or streamline repetitive tasks. While valuable, these technological assistants were reactive: they waited for human prompts and provided limited support within narrow boundaries.Today, a new chapter is unfolding. Agentic AI, whose systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step orchestration, represents a significant evolution. These systems don’t just assist, they act. They evaluate context, weigh outcomes and autonomously initiate actions, orchestrating complex workflows across functions. They adapt dynamically and collaborate with other agents in ways that are beginning to reshape enterprise operations at large. For leaders, this shift carries both opportunity and responsibility. The potential is immense, but so are the governance, trust and design challenges that come with giving AI systems greater autonomy. Enterprises must be able to monitor and override any actions taken by the agentic AI systems.Shift from assistance to autonomyTraditional AI assistants primarily respond to queries and perform isolated tasks. They are helpful but constrained. Agentic AI pushes further: multiple agents can collaborate, exchange context and manage workflows end-to-end.Imagine a procurement workflow. An assistant can pull vendor data or draft a purchase order. An agentic system, however, can review demand forecasts, evaluate vendor risk, check compliance policies, negotiate terms and finalize transactions. It does this all while coordinating across global business departments, including finance, operations and compliance.This shift from narrow support to autonomous orchestration is the defining leap of the next era of enterprise AI. It is not about replacing humans but about embedding intelligence into the very fabric of organizational workflows.Rethink enterprise workflows The goal of every enterprise department is focused on efficiency, scale and standardization. But agentic AI challenges enterprises to think differently. Instead of designing workflows step by step and inserting automation, organizations now need to completely reimagine and architect intelligent ecosystems for orchestrating processes, adapting to evolving business needs, and enabling seamless collaboration between humans and agents.That requires new thinking. Which decisions should remain human-led, and which can be delegated? How do you ensure agents access the correct data without overstepping boundaries? What happens when agents from finance, HR and supply chain must coordinate autonomously?The design of workflows is no longer about linear handoffs; it is about orchestrated ecosystems. Enterprises that get this right can achieve speed and agility that traditional automation cannot match.Accelerate agentic AI-led transformation with a unified platformIn this environment, unified platforms become critical. Without them, enterprises risk a proliferation of disconnected agents working at cross-purposes. A unified approach provides the guardrails with shared knowledge graphs, consistent policy frameworks and a single orchestration layer that ensures interoperability across business functions.This platform-based approach not only reduces complexity but also enables scale. Enterprises don’t want dozens of fragmented AI projects that stall in the pilot stages. They want enterprise-grade systems where agents can collaborate securely and consistently across the enterprise.Unified platforms simplify outcome monitoring and strengthen governance —both critical as systems become increasingly autonomous.Build trust and accountabilityAs AI systems act with greater independence, the stakes rise. An agent who makes flawed decisions in customer service may frustrate a client. An agent that mishandles a compliance process could expose the enterprise to regulatory risk.That’s why trust and accountability must be designed into agentic AI from the start. Governance is not an afterthought; it is a foundation. Leaders need clear policies defining the scope of agentic autonomy, transparent logging of decisions, evaluating and monitoring agents and escalation mechanisms when human oversight is required.Equally important is cultural trust. Employees must believe these systems are partners, not threats. This calls for change management, training, and communication that positions agentic AI as augmenting human capability rather than replacing it.Measure business value earlyOne of the most common pitfalls in enterprise AI adoption is the gap between promising pilots and at-scale results. Studies show that a significant percentage of AI projects never make it past experimentation. Agentic AI cannot afford to fall into this trap.Enterprises must measure business value early and continuously. This includes efficiency gains, cost reductions, error avoidance and even intangible benefits like faster decision-making or improved compliance. Success will be defined by automation coverage across processes, reductions in manual intervention and the ability to deliver new services at speed and scale.When designed responsibly, agentic AI can deliver exponential improvements. A procurement cycle reduced from weeks to hours, or a compliance review automated at scale, can fundamentally alter enterprise performance.Preparing for the futureThe rise of agentic AI does not mean handing over control to machines or codes. Instead, it marks the next phase of enterprise transformation, where humans and agents operate side by side in orchestrated systems.Leaders should start by piloting agentic systems in well-defined domains with clear governance models. From there, scaling across the enterprise requires investment in unified platforms, robust policy frameworks, and a culture that embraces intelligent automation as a partner in value creation.The enterprises that succeed will be those that approach agentic AI not as another tool, but as a strategic shift. Just as ERP and cloud once redefined operations, agentic AI is poised to do the same, reshaping workflows, governance, and the very way decisions are made.Agentic AI is moving the enterprise conversation from assistance to autonomy. That change comes with objective complexity, but also with extraordinary promise. The foundation for success lies in unified platforms that enable enterprises to orchestrate with intelligence, govern with trust, and scale with confidence. The journey is just beginning. And for enterprise leaders, now is the time to lead with vision, responsibility, and ambition.N Shashidhar is VP and Global Platform Head of EdgeVerve AI Next.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Marvel Studios had an elaborate marketing plan in place to introduce four teaser trailers for Avengers: Doomsday as previews prior to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash, with one teaser rolling out each successive week. But the first one leaked online a few days early, revealing that (as rumored) Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) will appear and will have a newborn baby, presumably with Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter. So maybe you've seen a bootleg version floating around the Internet, but Marvel has now released the HD version to the public. Merry Christmas! And we can look forward to three more: one focused on Thor, one on Doctor Doom, and the final one is purportedly a more traditional teaser trailer. As previously reported, Marvel Studios originally planned to build its Phase Six Avengers arc (The Kang Dynasty) around Jonathan Majors’ Kang the Conqueror (and associated variants), introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. But then Majors was convicted of domestic violence, and Marvel fired the actor soon after. That meant the studio needed to retool its Phase Six plans, culminating in the announced return of the Russo brothers, who directed four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s most successful films, which brought in more than $6 billion at the global box office.Read full article Comments",

It's a year of big change for the sport, which is adopting new power unit rules that place much more emphasis on the electric motor's contribution. The switch to the new power units was meant to attract new manufacturers to the sport, and in that regard, it has succeeded. But controversy has erupted already as loopholes appear and teams exploit them. Since 2014, F1 cars have used 1,000 hp (745 kW) power units that combine a turbocharged 1.6 L V6 gasoline engine with a pair of hybrid systems. One is the MGU-H, which recovers energy from (or deploys it to) the turbocharger's turbine; the other is a 160 hp (120 kW) MGU-K that harvests and deploys energy at the rear wheels. Starting next year, the MGU-H is gone, and the less-powerful 1.6 L V6 should generate about 536 hp (400 kW). That will be complemented by a 483 hp (350 kW) MGU-K, plus a much larger battery to supply it. And the new rules have already attracted new OEMs to the sport. After announcing its departure at the end of 2021—sort of— Honda changed its mind and signed on to the 2026 regs, supplying Aston Martin. Audi signed up and bought the Sauber team. Red Bull decided to build its own internal combustion engines, hiring heavily from the Mercedes program, but Ford is providing Red Bull with the MGU-K and the rest of the hybrid system. And Cadillac has started an engine program, albeit one that won't take the grid until 2029.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Since I’m fascinated by new display technologies and by improving image quality, I’ve never been a fan of home projectors. Projectors lack the image quality compared to good TVs and monitors, and they’re pretty needy. Without getting into the specific requirements of different models, you generally want a darker room with a large, blank wall for a projector to look its best. That can be a lot to ask for, especially in small, densely decorated homes like mine. That said, a projector can be a space-efficient alternative to a big-screen TV or help you watch TV or movies outside. A projector can be versatile when paired with the right space, especially if that projector makes sure the “right space” is included in the device. The Splay was crowdfunded in 2021, and its maker, Arovia, describes it as the “first fully collapsible monitor and projector.” In short, it’s a portable projector with an integrated fabric shroud that can serve as a big-screen (24.5 or 34.5 inches diagonally, depending on the model) portable monitor. Or, you can take off the fabric shroud and use the Splay as an ultra-short-throw projector and cast a display that measures up to 80 inches diagonally onto a wall.Read full article Comments",

More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA's Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket's launch cadence. Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin's ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014.

A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA's workforce. On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing's Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.Read full article Comments",

According to the pre-2025 version of Brendan Carr, the White House interfered with the agency's independence when a Democratic president publicly urged the FCC to adopt net neutrality rules. When the Biden-era FCC reinstated Obama-era net neutrality rules in 2024, Carr alleged that President Biden \"took the extraordinary step to pressure the FCC—an independent agency that is designed to operate outside undue political influence from the Executive Branch.\" As evidence, Carr pointed to a 2021 executive order in which Biden called on agency heads to \"consider using their authorities\" for various types of pro-competitive policies, including the adoption of net neutrality rules. Carr said that President Obama similarly \"pressure[d] an independent agency into grabbing power that the Legislative Branch never said it had delegated.\" Obama's intrusion into this independence, according to Carr, came in November 2014 when the president released a two-minute video urging the agency to implement net neutrality rules and reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.Read full article Comments",

A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983's Blue Thunder or British 1960s spy series The Prisoner? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: Homer's Odyssey. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan's The Odyssey, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic. Most of us read some version of The Odyssey in high school, so we're familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus' position. It's difficult to overestimate the tremendous influence Homer's epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the Odyssey performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. \"I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that,\" he recently told Empire. \"I think it's in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I've worked on—you know, they're all from the Odyssey.

In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense. The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power literally on day one, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge vacated that executive order, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed. But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was stopped by the Department of the Interior, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That hold was lifted following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and won a ruling that let it continue construction.Read full article Comments",

But the urgency with which Muller, a climate scientist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, considers such atmospheric puzzles has surged in recent years. As our planet swelters with global warming, storms are becoming more intense, sometimes dumping two or even three times more rain than expected. Such was the case in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, in March 2025: Almost half the city’s yearly average rainfall fell in less than 12 hours, causing deadly floods. Atmospheric scientists have long used computer simulations to track how the dynamics of air and moisture might produce varieties of storms. But existing models hadn’t fully explained the emergence of these fiercer storms. A roughly 200-year-old theory describes how warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air: an extra 7 percent for every degree Celsius of warming. But in models and weather observations, climate scientists have seen rainfall events far exceeding this expected increase. And those storms can lead to severe flooding when heavy rain falls on already saturated soils or follows humid heatwaves.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "San Francisco was affected by a massive power outage over the weekend. It started with a fire at a substation in the city on Saturday afternoon, causing a blackout that at times affected as much as a third of the city, leaving more than 130,000 homes without power. Among the city's affected critical systems were the traffic lights, which paralyzed Waymo's fleet of robotaxis, stopping them in their tracks and clogging traffic. Any recent visitor to San Francisco can't help but notice the profusion of sensor-festooned autonomous vehicles on the roads, especially the all-white Jaguar I-Paces that belong to Waymo. The robotaxi company has more than 800 AVs in its Bay Area fleet; that can feel like a conservative estimate when you see five or six at a time—invariably with no occupants—within a block. The cars navigate the city, combining high-resolution maps with inputs from lidar, optical, and other sensors on the upfitted Jags. The cars drive conservatively, but they can get confused in edge cases—earlier this month, Waymo issued a recall to fix a problem in which its robotaxis would illegally pass stopped school buses.Read full article Comments",
