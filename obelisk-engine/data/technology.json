Handles are going to be broken up into two broad categories. Priority handles will be free and “often include full names, multi-word phrases, or alphanumeric combinations.” Rare handles, on the other hand, will be a paid option, and “may be priced anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures, depending on demand and uniqueness.” X is treating this not as a one-time perk, but as an ongoing service to lure in more paid subscribers. If you secure a new handle, your old one will be frozen. The company says it may eventually offer a redirect option as a paid add-on. But more importantly, if you ever downgrade your X subscription, your account will revert back to your original username, and you’ll lose access to the one you snagged through the marketplace. The X Handle Marketplace is our industry-first solution to redistribute handles that are no longer in use. Eligible Premium subscribers will be able to search and make requests, with both complimentary and paid options available.&mdash; Handle Marketplace (@XHandles) October 19, 2025",

          "standfirst": "Techtober is a busy time for our reviews team as a deluge of new devices arrive before the holiday season. We’ve been hard at work conducting our in-depth testing, but it’s understandable if you missed a review or two over the last few weeks. Read on to catch up all the reviews you might’ve missed, including the latest trio of Google Pixel devices. Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a Earlier this month, a trio of new Pixel devices arrived for us to put through their paces. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold headlines the group, but the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a are also highly capable devices in their own categories. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford wrote that Google has removed one of the last remaining issues with foldable phones: durability. “The addition of proper dust and water resistance on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has removed one of the last two shortcomings of modern foldables, which is no mean feat,” he said. However, at $1,799, the price barrier is still hard to overcome for most folks.” Meta Ray-Ban Display The second-gen Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses may be the best option for most people right now, but the Meta Ray-Ban Display is the more exciting product for many. If you can get past the chunky look and in-progress features, you still have to contend with limited availability and a $800 price tag. “The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, on the other hand, still look very much like a first-gen product,” senior reporter Karissa Bell wrote. “There are some really compelling use cases for the display, but its functionality is limited.” ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X Microsoft’s collaboration with ASUS has produced a compelling gaming handheld that’s decidedly Xbox. The combination of familiar controls and a full-screen Xbox experience give this device an advantage over its Windows-based competition. “While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements,” Sam said. “The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here.” Bose QuietComfort Headphones (2nd gen) Bose never leave the top few spots on our best noise canceling headphones list, but its refresh of the QC Ultra Headphones put the company firmly back in first place. Updates to active noise cancellation, sound performance, battery life and power management are enough to recommend this model over the previous version and the Sony WH-1000XM6. “Similar to the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds over the summer, Bose didn’t make huge upgrades for the updated version of the QC Ultra Headphones,” I explained. “But what you do get here is a decent improvement over its predecessor.” Razer Blade 18 (2025) Razer’s massive 18-inch gaming laptop has impressive performance, but it’s size and limited battery life don’t offer a lot of convenience. “Personally, if I had to choose between Razer’s current lineup, I’d go with the Blade 16 so that I could actually carry it around and occasionally use it as a productivity machine,” senior reviews editor Devindra Hardawar wrote. “Not so with the Blade 18 — its short two hour and 17 minute battery life (in PCMark 10’s battery benchmark) means you’ll always need to lug around its beefy power adapter.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-new-pixel-devices-meta-ray-ban-display-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-more-130000215.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "As more companies quickly begin using gen AI, it’s important to avoid a big mistake that could impact its effectiveness: Proper onboarding. Companies spend time and money training new human workers to succeed, but when they use large language model (LLM) helpers, many treat them like simple tools that need no explanation. This isn&#x27;t just a waste of resources; it&#x27;s risky. Research shows that AI has advanced quickly from testing to actual use in 2024 to 2025, with almost a third of companies reporting a sharp increase in usage and acceptance from the previous year.Probabilistic systems need governance, not wishful thinkingUnlike traditional software, gen AI is probabilistic and adaptive. It learns from interaction, can drift as data or usage changes and operates in the gray zone between automation and agency. Treating it like static software ignores reality: Without monitoring and updates, models degrade and produce faulty outputs: A phenomenon widely known as model drift. Gen AI also lacks built-in organizational intelligence. A model trained on internet data may write a Shakespearean sonnet, but it won’t know your escalation paths and compliance constraints unless you teach it. Regulators and standards bodies have begun pushing guidance precisely because these systems behave dynamically and can hallucinate, mislead or leak data if left unchecked.The real-world costs of skipping onboardingWhen LLMs hallucinate, misinterpret tone, leak sensitive information or amplify bias, the costs are tangible.Misinformation and liability: A Canadian tribunal held Air Canada liable after its website chatbot gave a passenger incorrect policy information. The ruling made it clear that companies remain responsible for their AI agents’ statements.Embarrassing hallucinations: In 2025, a syndicated “summer reading list” carried by the Chicago Sun-Times and Philadelphia Inquirer recommended books that didn’t exist; the writer had used AI without adequate verification, prompting retractions and firings.Bias at scale: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOCs) first AI-discrimination settlement involved a recruiting algorithm that auto-rejected older applicants, underscoring how unmonitored systems can amplify bias and create legal risk.Data leakage: After employees pasted sensitive code into ChatGPT, Samsung temporarily banned public gen AI tools on corporate devices — an avoidable misstep with better policy and training.The message is simple: Un-onboarded AI and un-governed usage create legal, security and reputational exposure.Treat AI agents like new hiresEnterprises should onboard AI agents as deliberately as they onboard people — with job descriptions, training curricula, feedback loops and performance reviews. This is a cross-functional effort across data science, security, compliance, design, HR and the end users who will work with the system daily.Role definition. Spell out scope, inputs/outputs, escalation paths and acceptable failure modes. A legal copilot, for instance, can summarize contracts and surface risky clauses, but should avoid final legal judgments and must escalate edge cases.Contextual training. Fine-tuning has its place, but for many teams, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and tool adapters are safer, cheaper and more auditable. RAG keeps models grounded in your latest, vetted knowledge (docs, policies, knowledge bases), reducing hallucinations and improving traceability. Emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations make it easier to connect copilots to enterprise systems in a controlled way — bridging models with tools and data while preserving separation of concerns. Salesforce’s Einstein Trust Layer illustrates how vendors are formalizing secure grounding, masking, and audit controls for enterprise AI.Simulation before production. Don’t let your AI’s first “training” be with real customers. Build high-fidelity sandboxes and stress-test tone, reasoning and edge cases — then evaluate with human graders. Morgan Stanley built an evaluation regimen for its GPT-4 assistant, having advisors and prompt engineers grade answers and refine prompts before broad rollout. The result: >98% adoption among advisor teams once quality thresholds were met. Vendors are also moving to simulation: Salesforce recently highlighted digital-twin testing to rehearse agents safely against realistic scenarios. 4) Cross-functional mentorship. Treat early usage as a two-way learning loop: Domain experts and front-line users give feedback on tone, correctness and usefulness; security and compliance teams enforce boundaries and red lines; designers shape frictionless UIs that encourage proper use.Feedback loops and performance reviews—foreverOnboarding doesn’t end at go-live. The most meaningful learning begins after deployment.Monitoring and observability: Log outputs, track KPIs (accuracy, satisfaction, escalation rates) and watch for degradation. Cloud providers now ship observability/evaluation tooling to help teams detect drift and regressions in production, especially for RAG systems whose knowledge changes over time.User feedback channels. Provide in-product flagging and structured review queues so humans can coach the model — then close the loop by feeding these signals into prompts, RAG sources or fine-tuning sets.Regular audits. Schedule alignment checks, factual audits and safety evaluations. Microsoft’s enterprise responsible-AI playbooks, for instance, emphasize governance and staged rollouts with executive visibility and clear guardrails.Succession planning for models. As laws, products and models evolve, plan upgrades and retirement the way you would plan people transitions — run overlap tests and port institutional knowledge (prompts, eval sets, retrieval sources).Why this is urgent nowGen AI is no longer an “innovation shelf” project — it’s embedded in CRMs, support desks, analytics pipelines and executive workflows. Banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are focusing AI on internal copilot use cases to boost employee efficiency while constraining customer-facing risk, an approach that hinges on structured onboarding and careful scoping. Meanwhile, security leaders say gen AI is everywhere, yet one-third of adopters haven’t implemented basic risk mitigations, a gap that invites shadow AI and data exposure.The AI-native workforce also expects better: Transparency, traceability, and the ability to shape the tools they use. Organizations that provide this — through training, clear UX affordances and responsive product teams — see faster adoption and fewer workarounds. When users trust a copilot, they use it; when they don’t, they bypass it.As onboarding matures, expect to see AI enablement managers and PromptOps specialists in more org charts, curating prompts, managing retrieval sources, running eval suites and coordinating cross-functional updates. Microsoft’s internal Copilot rollout points to this operational discipline: Centers of excellence, governance templates and executive-ready deployment playbooks. These practitioners are the “teachers” who keep AI aligned with fast-moving business goals.A practical onboarding checklistIf you’re introducing (or rescuing) an enterprise copilot, start here:Write the job description. Scope, inputs/outputs, tone, red lines, escalation rules.Ground the model. Implement RAG (and/or MCP-style adapters) to connect to authoritative, access-controlled sources; prefer dynamic grounding over broad fine-tuning where possible.Build the simulator. Create scripted and seeded scenarios; measure accuracy, coverage, tone, safety; require human sign-offs to graduate stages.Ship with guardrails. DLP, data masking, content filters and audit trails (see vendor trust layers and responsible-AI standards).Instrument feedback. In-product flagging, analytics and dashboards; schedule weekly triage.Review and retrain. Monthly alignment checks, quarterly factual audits and planned model upgrades — with side-by-side A/Bs to prevent regressions.In a future where every employee has an AI teammate, the organizations that take onboarding seriously will move faster, safer and with greater purpose. Gen AI doesn’t just need data or compute; it needs guidance, goals, and growth plans.

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. I've reluctantly paused Ball x Pit for long enough to share some neat new releases and more details on upcoming games — some of which are arriving very soon. We've got a notable update for a classic as well. Steam Next Fest is taking place at the minute, and you still have until Monday to join in by checking out some of the many, many demos that have gone live for the event. Thanks partially (okay, almost entirely) to being unable to escape Ball x Pit, I've only tried a fewm Next Fest demos so far. I'm a fan of Aerial_Knight's Never Yield and after last year's sequel, it's cool to see solo developer Neil Jones (aka Aerial_Knight) trying something totally different. Aerial_Knight’s DropShot is a skydiving first-person shooter with finger guns and dragons. It’s a single-player game in which the aim is to take out your opponents and reach the ground first. Like Jones' previous games, it's stylish and fast-paced. I'm planning to check out the full game when it arrives down the line.It certainly helps to be a fast, accurate typer when you put words together for a living, but I wasn't quick or precise enough to win any rounds in the Final Sentence demo. This is a battle royale for up to 100 players in which you're at a typewriter and have to bash out sentences (or other strings of letters, numbers and symbols) in a race to the finish. If you run out of time, make too many mistakes or don't win, it's lights out, courtesy of the masked figure with a revolver who’s standing in front of you. There are some nice touches here. Having to type out the rules in the first few rounds is a clever idea on the part of developer Button Mash. I haven't won a round myself yet (I finished in second place a couple of times), but watched some streamers play. It's very funny when the winning player flips the bird at the guy holding a revolver in front of them. Final Sentence is coming to Steam later this year. Maybe I'll have learned how to spell \"sphinx\" by then.There are a few other Next Fest demos I'd like to try this weekend, namely:Crashout Crew (Overcooked-style co-op chaos with forklifts)Reanimal (co-op horror from the team behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2)Slots & Daggers (as if I need another slot-machine-based roguelite in my life right now) The Last Caretaker (sci-fi survival)Goodnight Universe (we'll get to that)I've been looking forward to Skate Story for forever, but I think I'm going to skip that demo. I'm already sold and I'm fine with waiting a couple more months before playing the whole thing.There are a couple of showcases coming up next week that might be worth keeping an eye on. The third annual edition of DreadXP's indie horror showcase is set for 1PM ET on October 23.

I love when you get to play a game as a weird little guy. The game of the same name is a spooky NES homebrew platformer from Calgames. Mister Scary can stomp on his enemies, or freeze or burn them after eating a snack. When Mister Scary ducks, he becomes immune to damage because he's taking a nap. I appreciate that. Nothing scary can happen while you're snoozing.Mister Scary is $10 on Itch. You'll need to plug the ROM into a NES emulator to become Mister Scary.The only reason I still have Flash Player installed on my PC is so I can open N, which sits on my desktop, once in a while. I've been playing that classic freeware platformer for a long time, and now there's a good reason for many people to revisit the third entry in the series. As a thank you to the N++ community, Metanet Software is releasing a free update to mark the 10th anniversary of the game's PS4 debut. TEN++ is said to include the developer's \"most challenging levels yet.\" Given how darn tough these games are already, that's saying something. The update is available now on Steam and it's coming to the console versions of N++ soon.The Cabin Factory is an anomaly-hunting (i.e. spot the difference) game in the style of The Exit 8. You'll examine horror-themed cabins that are built for use in movies and theme parks to make sure they aren't actually haunted. If you spot an anomaly, you'll want to get out of the cabin post haste.This $3 horror walking sim from International Cat Studios and publisher Future Friends Games debuted on Steam last year, and it just hit consoles in time for Halloween.

Alas, the latest game from the legendary Ron Gilbert now has a release date, and it's very soon!In Death by Scrolling, the aim is to collect enough gold to pay a ferryman so you can escape purgatory. However, there's a wall of fire coming after you the whole time, so you'll need to keep moving in order to try to stay alive. You'll also need to avoid or stun an unkillable grim reaper as you collect gold and gems that unlock upgrades. Death by Scrolling is from Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and MicroProse Software. It's coming to Steam on October 28.There's a lot going on in Silly Polly Beast. It's safe to say this game is a shooter, but the release date trailer rapidly flits between perspectives and genres. There's an emphasis on survival horror, along with puzzles and stealth segments. Polly will even sometimes remove the board that's strapped to her back for some skateboarding sequences. This is said to have a story that morphs and evolves as much as the gameplay does. After escaping her hellish orphanage, Polly lands right in the underworld and has to navigate her way out of that too. Developer Andrei Chernyshov and publisher Top Hat Studios are behind Silly Polly Beast. It's coming to Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch on October 28.Also coming to Steam on October 28 is a project from Autoscopia Interactive that's designed to be played in a single sitting.

          "content": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. I've reluctantly paused Ball x Pit for long enough to share some neat new releases and more details on upcoming games — some of which are arriving very soon. We've got a notable update for a classic as well. Steam Next Fest is taking place at the minute, and you still have until Monday to join in by checking out some of the many, many demos that have gone live for the event. Thanks partially (okay, almost entirely) to being unable to escape Ball x Pit, I've only tried a fewm Next Fest demos so far. I'm a fan of Aerial_Knight's Never Yield and after last year's sequel, it's cool to see solo developer Neil Jones (aka Aerial_Knight) trying something totally different. Aerial_Knight’s DropShot is a skydiving first-person shooter with finger guns and dragons. It’s a single-player game in which the aim is to take out your opponents and reach the ground first. Like Jones' previous games, it's stylish and fast-paced. I'm planning to check out the full game when it arrives down the line.It certainly helps to be a fast, accurate typer when you put words together for a living, but I wasn't quick or precise enough to win any rounds in the Final Sentence demo. This is a battle royale for up to 100 players in which you're at a typewriter and have to bash out sentences (or other strings of letters, numbers and symbols) in a race to the finish. If you run out of time, make too many mistakes or don't win, it's lights out, courtesy of the masked figure with a revolver who’s standing in front of you. There are some nice touches here. Having to type out the rules in the first few rounds is a clever idea on the part of developer Button Mash. I haven't won a round myself yet (I finished in second place a couple of times), but watched some streamers play. It's very funny when the winning player flips the bird at the guy holding a revolver in front of them. Final Sentence is coming to Steam later this year. Maybe I'll have learned how to spell \"sphinx\" by then.There are a few other Next Fest demos I'd like to try this weekend, namely:Crashout Crew (Overcooked-style co-op chaos with forklifts)Reanimal (co-op horror from the team behind Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2)Slots & Daggers (as if I need another slot-machine-based roguelite in my life right now) The Last Caretaker (sci-fi survival)Goodnight Universe (we'll get to that)I've been looking forward to Skate Story for forever, but I think I'm going to skip that demo. I'm already sold and I'm fine with waiting a couple more months before playing the whole thing.There are a couple of showcases coming up next week that might be worth keeping an eye on. The third annual edition of DreadXP's indie horror showcase is set for 1PM ET on October 23. You can catch that on the publisher's YouTube channel.Two hours later, you'll be able to tune into the Galaxies Autumn showcase.

There are a deluge of options: PostgreSQL with pgvector, MySQL HeatWave, DuckDB VSS, SQLite VSS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus and several others.The riches of choices sound like a boon to companies. But just beneath, a growing problem looms: Stack instability. New vector DBs appear each quarter, with disparate APIs, indexing schemes and performance trade-offs. Today&#x27;s ideal choice may look dated or limiting tomorrow.To business AI teams, volatility translates into lock-in risks and migration hell. Most projects begin life with lightweight engines like DuckDB or SQLite for prototyping, then move to Postgres, MySQL or a cloud-native service in production. Each switch involves rewriting queries, reshaping pipelines, and slowing down deployments.This re-engineering merry-go-round undermines the very speed and agility that AI adoption is supposed to bring.Why portability matters nowCompanies have a tricky balancing act:Experiment quickly with minimal overhead, in hopes of trying and getting early value; Scale safely on stable, production-quality infrastructure without months of refactoring;Be nimble in a world where new and better backends arrive nearly every month. Without portability, organizations stagnate. They have technical debt from recursive code paths, are hesitant to adopt new technology and cannot move prototypes to production at pace.

Historically, we&#x27;ve seen how this principle reshaped entire industries:ODBC/JDBC gave enterprises a single way to query relational databases, reducing the risk of being tied to Oracle, MySQL or SQL Server; Apache Arrow standardized columnar data formats, so data systems could play nice together; ONNX created a vendor-agnostic format for machine learning (ML) models, bringing TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. together; Kubernetes abstracted infrastructure details, so workloads could run the same everywhere on clouds;any-llm (Mozilla AI) now makes it possible to have one API across lots of large language model (LLM) vendors, so playing with AI is safer. All these abstractions led to adoption by lowering switching costs. They turned broken ecosystems into solid, enterprise-level infrastructure.Vector databases are also at the same tipping point.The adapter approach to vectorsInstead of having application code directly bound to some specific vector backend, companies can compile against an abstraction layer that normalizes operations like inserts, queries and filtering.This doesn&#x27;t necessarily eliminate the need to choose a backend; it makes that choice less rigid. Development teams can start with DuckDB or SQLite in the lab, then scale up to Postgres or MySQL for production and ultimately adopt a special-purpose cloud vector DB without having to re-architect the application.Open source efforts like Vectorwrap are early examples of this approach, presenting a single Python API to Postgres, MySQL, DuckDB and SQLite.
