          "content": "The Department of Justice has announced a settlement with RealPage, the widely used rent-setting software that it accused of engaging in collusion to drive up rent prices by sharing previously private information from competing landlords. The settlement puts limits on RealPage’s ability to collect and use that data, and blocks it from being used to set rents. Last year, the DOJ and several other states filed an antitrust lawsuit against RealPage, claiming that the company’s rent-setting software combines data from competing landlords to provide daily rental price suggestions. “As competitor-landlords increase their rents, RealPage’s software nudges other competing landlords to increase their rents as well,” the DOJ alleged. If the court approves the DOJ’s settlement, RealPage must only use data from landlords that is 12 months or older to power its algorithm. The settlement also requires RealPage to “remove or redesign” features that discourage landlords from lowering prices or prompt landlords to match their prices with competitors. RealPage would also be barred from offering “hyperlocalized pricing” information, which Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater describes in a video on X as hiking up rents “block-by-block.” RealPage denies any wrongdoing. “RealPage was replacing competition with coordination, and renters paid the price,” Slater said. “We reached a settlement that stops RealPage from coordinating pricing with its customers.”",

          "title": "Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 is here: Cheaper AI, infinite chats, and coding skills that beat humans",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic released its most capable artificial intelligence model yet on Monday, slashing prices by roughly two-thirds while claiming state-of-the-art performance on software engineering tasks — a strategic move that intensifies the AI startup&#x27;s competition with deep-pocketed rivals OpenAI and Google.The new model, Claude Opus 4.5, scored higher on Anthropic&#x27;s most challenging internal engineering assessment than any human job candidate in the company&#x27;s history, according to materials reviewed by VentureBeat. The result underscores both the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI systems and growing questions about how the technology will reshape white-collar professions.The Amazon-backed company is pricing Claude Opus 4.5 at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens — a dramatic reduction from the $15 and $75 rates for its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.1, released earlier this year. The move makes frontier AI capabilities accessible to a broader swath of developers and enterprises while putting pressure on competitors to match both performance and pricing.\"We want to make sure this really works for people who want to work with these models,\" said Alex Albert, Anthropic&#x27;s head of developer relations, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That is really our focus: How can we enable Claude to be better at helping you do the things that you don&#x27;t necessarily want to do in your job?\"The announcement comes as Anthropic races to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field. OpenAI recently released GPT-5.1 and a specialized coding model called Codex Max that can work autonomously for extended periods. Google unveiled Gemini 3 just last week, prompting concerns even from OpenAI about the search giant&#x27;s progress, according to a recent report from The Information.Opus 4.5 demonstrates improved judgment on real-world tasks, developers sayAnthropic&#x27;s internal testing revealed what the company describes as a qualitative leap in Claude Opus 4.5&#x27;s reasoning capabilities. The model achieved 80.9% accuracy on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark measuring real-world software engineering tasks, outperforming OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (77.9%), Anthropic&#x27;s own Sonnet 4.5 (77.2%), and Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro (76.2%), according to the company&#x27;s data. The result marks a notable advance over OpenAI&#x27;s current state-of-the-art model, which was released just five days earlier.But the technical benchmarks tell only part of the story. Albert said employee testers consistently reported that the model demonstrates improved judgment and intuition across diverse tasks — a shift he described as the model developing a sense of what matters in real-world contexts.\"The model just kind of gets it,\" Albert said. \"It just has developed this sort of intuition and judgment on a lot of real world things that feels qualitatively like a big jump up from past models.\"He pointed to his own workflow as an example. Previously, Albert said, he would ask AI models to gather information but hesitated to trust their synthesis or prioritization. With Opus 4.5, he&#x27;s delegating more complete tasks, connecting it to Slack and internal documents to produce coherent summaries that match his priorities.Opus 4.5 outscores all human candidates on company&#x27;s toughest engineering testThe model&#x27;s performance on Anthropic&#x27;s internal engineering assessment marks a notable milestone. The take-home exam, designed for prospective performance engineering candidates, is meant to evaluate technical ability and judgment under time pressure within a prescribed two-hour limit.Using a technique called parallel test-time compute — which aggregates multiple attempts from the model and selects the best result — Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate who has taken the test, according to company. Without a time limit, the model matched the performance of the best-ever human candidate when used within Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s coding environment.The company acknowledged that the test doesn&#x27;t measure other crucial professional skills such as collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years of experience. Still, Anthropic said the result \"raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession.\"Albert emphasized the significance of the finding. \"I think this is kind of a sign, maybe, of what&#x27;s to come around how useful these models can actually be in a work context and for our jobs,\" he said. \"Of course, this was an engineering task, and I would say models are relatively ahead in engineering compared to other fields, but I think it&#x27;s a really important signal to pay attention to.\"Dramatic efficiency improvements cut token usage by up to 76% on key benchmarksBeyond raw performance, Anthropic is betting that efficiency improvements will differentiate Claude Opus 4.5 in the market. The company says the model uses dramatically fewer tokens — the units of text that AI systems process — to achieve similar or better outcomes compared to predecessors.At a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches the previous Sonnet 4.5 model&#x27;s best score on SWE-bench Verified while using 76% fewer output tokens, according to Anthropic. At the highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points while still using 48% fewer tokens.To give developers more control, Anthropic introduced an \"effort parameter\" that allows users to adjust how much computational work the model applies to each task — balancing performance against latency and cost.Enterprise customers provided early validation of the efficiency claims. \"Opus 4.5 beats Sonnet 4.5 and competition on our internal benchmarks, using fewer tokens to solve the same problems,\" said Michele Catasta, president of Replit, a cloud-based coding platform, in a statement to VentureBeat. \"At scale, that efficiency compounds.\"GitHub&#x27;s chief product officer, Mario Rodriguez, said early testing shows Opus 4.5 \"surpasses internal coding benchmarks while cutting token usage in half, and is especially well-suited for tasks like code migration and code refactoring.\"Early customers report AI agents that learn from experience and refine their own skillsOne of the most striking capabilities demonstrated by early customers involves what Anthropic calls \"self-improving agents\" — AI systems that can refine their own performance through iterative learning.Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce and internet company, tested Claude Opus 4.5 on automation of office tasks. \"Our agents were able to autonomously refine their own capabilities — achieving peak performance in 4 iterations while other models couldn&#x27;t match that quality after 10,\" said Yusuke Kaji, Rakuten&#x27;s general manager of AI for business.Albert explained that the model isn&#x27;t updating its own weights — the fundamental parameters that define an AI system&#x27;s behavior — but rather iteratively improving the tools and approaches it uses to solve problems. \"It was iteratively refining a skill for a task and seeing that it&#x27;s trying to optimize the skill to get better performance so it could accomplish this task,\" he said.The capability extends beyond coding. Albert said Anthropic has observed significant improvements in creating professional documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. \"They&#x27;re saying that this has been the biggest jump they&#x27;ve seen between model generations,\" Albert said. \"So going even from Sonnet 4.5 to Opus 4.5, bigger jump than any two models back to back in the past.\"Fundamental Research Labs, a financial modeling firm, reported that \"accuracy on our internal evals improved 20%, efficiency rose 15%, and complex tasks that once seemed out of reach became achievable,\" according to co-founder Nico Christie.New features target Excel users, Chrome workflows and eliminate chat length limitsAlongside the model release, Anthropic rolled out a suite of product updates aimed at enterprise users. Claude for Excel became generally available for Max, Team, and Enterprise users with new support for pivot tables, charts, and file uploads. The Chrome browser extension is now available to all Max users.Perhaps most significantly, Anthropic introduced \"infinite chats\" — a feature that eliminates context window limitations by automatically summarizing earlier parts of conversations as they grow longer. \"Within Claude AI, within the product itself, you effectively get this kind of infinite context window due to the compaction, plus some memory things that we&#x27;re doing,\" Albert explained.For developers, Anthropic released \"programmatic tool calling,\" which allows Claude to write and execute code that invokes functions directly. Claude Code gained an updated \"Plan Mode\" and became available on desktop in research preview, enabling developers to run multiple AI agent sessions in parallel.Market heats up as OpenAI, Google race to match performance and pricingAnthropic reached $2 billion in annualized revenue during the first quarter of 2025, more than doubling from $1 billion in the prior period. The number of customers spending more than $100,000 annually jumped eightfold year-over-year.The rapid release of Opus 4.5 — just weeks after Haiku 4.5 in October and Sonnet 4.5 in September — reflects broader industry dynamics. OpenAI released multiple GPT-5 variants throughout 2025, including a specialized Codex Max model in November that can work autonomously for up to 24 hours. Google shipped Gemini 3 in mid-November after months of development.Albert attributed Anthropic&#x27;s accelerated pace partly to using Claude to speed its own development. \"We&#x27;re seeing a lot of assistance and speed-up by Claude itself, whether it&#x27;s on the actual product building side or on the model research side,\" he said.The pricing reduction for Opus 4.5 could pressure margins while potentially expanding the addressable market. \"I&#x27;m expecting to see a lot of startups start to incorporate this into their products much more and feature it prominently,\" Albert said.Yet profitability remains elusive for leading AI labs as they invest heavily in computing infrastructure and research talent. The AI market is projected to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade, but no single provider has established dominant market position—even as models reach a threshold where they can meaningfully automate complex knowledge work.Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, called Opus 4.5 \"a notable improvement over the prior Claude models inside Cursor, with improved pricing and intelligence on difficult coding tasks.\" Scott Wu, CEO of Cognition, an AI coding startup, said the model delivers \"stronger results on our hardest evaluations and consistent performance through 30-minute autonomous coding sessions.\"For enterprises and developers, the competition translates to rapidly improving capabilities at falling prices. But as AI performance on technical tasks approaches—and sometimes exceeds—human expert levels, the technology&#x27;s impact on professional work becomes less theoretical.When asked about the engineering exam results and what they signal about AI&#x27;s trajectory, Albert was direct: \"I think it&#x27;s a really important signal to pay attention to.\"",

Whether that’s the main oven in your kitchen or a multi-function countertop unit, with some affordable accessories, you can easily up your game without spending $1,000 on a dedicated appliance. For example, my Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer has a convection pizza setting that automatically adjusts cook time based on the size, oven temperature and whether the pie is fresh or frozen. A key consideration here is size. These things are massive, about the size of a large microwave, so you likely won’t want to keep them out all the time unless you have a huge kitchen. What to look for in a pizza oven When shopping for a home oven or dedicated pizza oven, you’ll first want to consider what types of pies you plan to make. Most portable pizza ovens from the likes of Ooni, Solo Stove and others use wood burning fuel and are primarily designed for the high-heat cooking required for light and airy Neapolitan-style pizzas. We’re talking high temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. These units can certainly cook different styles of pizza at cooler temperatures, but the learning curve is easiest when you’re running them wide open with a full load of wood. You'll also want to consider alternate fuel types. If you purchase a propane or natural gas burner, you can adjust temperatures easily by turning a knob. For this reason, I recommend you spend the extra $100 or so on that accessory. This dual-fuel option makes your pizza oven a lot more versatile and gives you the option to still have a freshly fired pie when you don’t feel like messing with wood or charcoal. If you only want to cook with gas, there are models available that only use propane or natural gas. The other key consideration for aspiring pizza makers is size. Most companies make ovens that fit 12-inch pizzas, a perfect size for a personal pan pizza. They’re also great for pizza parties, since people can customize their own without having to pick off toppings they don’t like. If you want to make larger pizzas or plan to use your oven for other things (pans, etc), consider a larger version that can accommodate more than just small pies. The interior dimensions – or at the very least the pizza stone size – will be listed on most product pages. How to prepare before outdoor cooking Making good pizza at home requires a considerable amount of counter or table space. You’ll need room to stretch and prep your pizza dough, lay out your mozzarella, other cheeses and toppings and load pies onto a peel. Of course, some folks will be comfortable working in the tight confines of a small kitchen, but I’ve found it much easier to use extra space to make sure I’m not constantly moving things around during the various steps in the process. It’s also less hassle to set up your pizza-making station in close proximity to your oven. As a pizza-baking beginner, I did the running back and forth from the kitchen to the back porch. It’s far from ideal. It’s difficult to maintain your fire (if using wood or charcoal) when you’re unable to watch it closely. The good news is a patio table can be easily converted into a pizza station with a large cutting board. This also gets your oven off the ground so it’s easier to access. Ooni sells tables for its ovens that also offer shelving and storage for peels and other accessories. Solo Stove has a rolling stand for its Pi oven too, with small side shelves and a spot for your propane tank underneath. Of course, you can find other tables and stands to suit your needs, just make sure they can withstand any heat that may radiate from the bottom of the oven while cooking. Most ovens are either well insulated or don’t project too much excess heat toward the table, but you can never be too careful. For that reason, a stainless steel or metal surface is a good choice to set up an outdoor model. Most of these ovens heat up quickly and cook at high temperatures, especially if you’re making Neapolitan pizza. Having everything you need nearby so you can keep tabs on the oven and quickly make the next pie — especially the first pizza — will ease a lot of unnecessary headaches. When your cook time is two minutes or less, you don’t want to venture too far. The best pizza accessories for the oven you already have If you want to make a good pizza that rivals that of your favorite pizzeria (and without spending hundreds of dollars on a dedicated oven), you can definitely do it with the home oven you already have in your kitchen. With a few gadgets, you can improve your game without splurging on a Breville, Ooni or Solo Stove. First, I’d recommend a high quality baking steel or stone. Baking stones are great for getting better browning on the bottom of your pies than a pizza or sheet pan. You can also use them for bread, cookies and other items. The stone absorbs heat to cook pizza quickly, and you’ll get that charred crust like a brick oven provides. They’re also more affordable compared to baking steels. Those metal slabs do have one key advantage: higher heat conductivity. This means a steel will cook your pizzas faster since it can absorb more heat from your oven. While baking steels can be used as griddles on your stovetop and for other types of baking, they’re not ideal for some leavened breads. The second item you’ll want is a pizza peel. These come in all shapes and sizes, made out of a variety of materials. I typically use a bamboo or wooden peel when topping and launching my pizzas and then a metal one for retrieving them. I’ve found that dough doesn’t stick as easily to bamboo during prep and the metal resists the high heat of the oven when turning or retrieving a finished pizza (bamboo will burn). There are also perforated peels which allow both steam and excess flour to escape. A peel is a great tool for loading and turning pizzas, getting them in the back of the oven, and since you’ll typically be cooking them with your oven at 500 degrees or hotter, using something like parchment paper to move them around won’t work. And if you’re going for a New York style pizza, just make sure your dough recipe and ingredients are geared toward that thinner, crispy crust — the right accessories alone won’t be enough.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-pizza-oven-141550352.html?src=rss",
          "content": "In the last few years, pizza ovens have become as much of a backyard staple as a grill. There are many options for making restaurant-quality pies at home in a range of styles. What’s more, many models allow you to change up the fuel type, and some even allow you to do more than simply fire off pizzas. I’ve compiled a list of the best pizza ovens that you can buy right now, with selections for multi-fuel ovens, compact designs and indoor pizza parties. I’ve also included some buying advice on what to consider before you commit and how to get the most out of your at-home pizza making experience.

          "standfirst": "HBO Max has rolled out a limited-time, one-year subscription deal, offering a chance to stream HBO originals and Warner Bros. blockbusters at a lower cost. The platform has reduced pricing to $3 per month for one year, bringing the final cost down to $36 for the year. With many streaming services increasing their rates, this short-term offer lets you catch up on hit shows and new releases without committing to a full year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-streaming-deals-include-one-year-of-hbo-max-for-36-163017424.html?src=rss",

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

Now at version 4.5, the new system offers state-of-the-art performance in coding, computer use and office tasks. No surprise there, those have been some of Claude's greatest strengths for a while. The good news is Anthropic is rolling out a handful of existing tools more broadly alongside Opus 4.5. It's also releasing one new feature. To start, the company's Chrome extension, Claude for Chrome, is now available to all Max users. Anthropic is also introducing a feature called infinite chat. Provided you pay to use Claude, the chatbot won't fall to context window errors, allowing it to maintain consistency across files and chats. According to Anthropic, infinite chat was one of the most requested features from its users. Then there's Claude for Excel, which brings the chatbot to a sidebar inside of Microsoft's app. The tool is now broadly available to all Max, Team and Enterprise users, with support for pivot tables, charts and file uploads built-in. A table comparing Opus 4.5's efforts in various benchmarks. AnthropicOn the subject of Excel, Anthropic says early testers saw a 20 percent accuracy improvement on their internal evaluations and a 15 percent improvement in efficiency gains. As a complete Excel noob, I'm excited to for the company to trickle down that expertise to its more consumer-oriented models, Claude Sonnet and Haiku. Elsewhere, Opus 4.5 also delivers improvements in agentic workflows, with the new model excelling at refining its own processes. More importantly, Anthropic is calling Opus 4.5 its safest model yet. It’s better at rejecting prompt injection style attacks, outpacing even Gemini 3 Pro, according to Anthropic’s own evaluations. If you want to try Opus 4.5 for yourself, it’s available today through all of Anthropic’s apps and the company’s API. For developers, pricing for the new model starts at $5 per million tokens.

That’s why it’s a good idea to wait for Apple Black Friday deals. You won’t find pure discounts at Apple’s site, but retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more are happy to discount iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, and AirPods— and we’ve rounded up the best sales right here. Check out the best Black Friday Apple deals below. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $100 ($79 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $89. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Walmart: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Also at Amazon. EarPods for $13 ($6 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,441 ($157 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple TV Black Friday deal Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.

          "standfirst": "With Black Friday around the corner, OpenAI is upgrading ChatGPT's shopping capabilities just in time to make spending your money even easier. Starting today, the company has begun rolling out shopping research, a new feature inside of ChatGPT designed to simplify the process of comparing different products. The tool is available to all ChatGPT users, including those with free accounts, with the company offering nearly unlimited usage through the holidays. As long as you're logged into your OpenAI account, you can try out the new experience by selecting \"Shopping research\" from the + menu. ChatGPT will also automatically route prompts it determines would be best served by the new model OpenAI has trained to answer commerce-related questions. For instance, if you type, \"find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" ChatGPT will know what to do. As it works to find products that fit your criteria, ChatGPT will ask clarifying questions. OpenAIIn addition to comparative shopping, the new experience can help users track down deals, shop for gifts and even find lookalike products. For example, you can snap a photo of a dress and ask ChatGPT to find you something similar that costs less than $250. As you use the tool, ChatGPT will ask clarifying questions to help it narrow down its recommendations. For ChatGPT Pulse users, the tool will even be proactive, generating cards that offer personalized buying guides based on past conversations. The feature is powered by a variant of GPT-5 mini designed to excel specifically at shopping-related tasks. \"We trained it to read trusted sites, cite reliable sources and synthesize information across many sources to produce high-quality product research,\" said OpenAI. In practice, the shopping assistant should be better at accurately citing product details relative to the company's other systems, including more powerful general-purpose models like GPT-5 Thinking. Still, OpenAI warns the tool isn't perfect. \"Shopping research might make mistakes about product details like price and availability, and we encourage you to visit the merchant site for the most accurate details,\" the company said. Additionally, OpenAI notes the tool tends to do best in categories like electronics, beauty and home appliances where there are many details and specs the model can compare to generate comprehensive answers. It's no surprise to see OpenAI expand ChatGPT's shopping capabilities. The company already offers the option to buy items from Etsy from its chatbot, and competitors like Google have been aggressively adding AI shopping features in recent months.

          "standfirst": "These days, Black Friday is the longest day of the year. We're a week out from the big day, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform like Apple TV or HBO Max, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on MasterClass (to pick up a new hobby with all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription. We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering a six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-deals-include-discounts-on-hbo-max-apple-tv-masterclass-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000748.html?src=rss",
          "content": "These days, Black Friday is the longest day of the year. We're a week out from the big day, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform like Apple TV or HBO Max, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on MasterClass (to pick up a new hobby with all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription. We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering a six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way.

          "standfirst": "Apple updated its flagship earbuds this year with the new AirPods Pro 3, but the AirPods Pro 2 were our top picks for the best wireless earbuds for Apple users for many years before that. They're a bit hard to find at this point, but Walmart Black Friday deals have come for them (in addition to a bunch of other Apple products). Walmart has the AirPods Pro 2 for $139, which is the lowest price we've ever seen them and more than $100 off their standard $249 price tag. During Black Friday last year, they dropped to around $155. At this price, the AirPods Pro 2 are a good option for anyone who wants most of the conveniences and features of the Pro 3s without spending nearly $100 more. They have excellent active noise cancellation and great sound quality, and thanks to a firmware update, they do support Apple's new Live Translation feature. Using the buds in tandem with the Translate app on iPhones running iOS 26 or later, you can translate foreign languages in conversation in real time, hearing other languages being spoken to you in your preferred language. Sound quality remains great on the Pro 2 and battery life hits at around six hours of use on a single charge with ANC enabled. The wireless charging case that comes with the Pro 2 actually offers more total hours of listening time than the Pro 3 — 30 hours in total, in comparison to the Pro 3's 24 hours. You also get most of Apple's health tracking capabilities along with all the conveniences of the H2 chipset, which includes quick pairing and switching, plus hands-free Siri. What you won't get here is built-in heart rate tracking and improved sound quality and ANC, all of which are stand-out features of the new Pro 3. In addition to the AirPods Pro 2, other AirPods are on sale for Black Friday. AirPods 4, both with and without ANC, are down to record-low or near-record low prices. Plus, the new AirPods Pro 3 are on sale for their best price since their launch in September. We'll update this post as more Walmart Black Friday tech deals come in.

          "title": "The best Black Friday deals on SSDs, microSD cards and other storage devices we could find for 2025",
          "standfirst": "If you’re looking to grab a new SSD for a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget, Black Friday is typically a good time to take the plunge. To help you separate the fake discounts from the stuff worth your time, we’ve picked through the many sales going on now and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could find below. So far we’re seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we're updating this post as we find more offers worth calling out. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off MSRP): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express Card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want more space for a Switch 2, the 512GB version of Samsung’s P9 Express microSD Express card is also on sale for a new low of $75. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Best Buy ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Amazon and B&H. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $750 at Amazon ($250 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at B&H ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at Amazon. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. White this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-microsd-cards-and-other-storage-devices-we-could-find-for-2025-175429908.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Some people shop Black Friday sales for discounts on shoes and socket wrenches, duvet covers and blow up mattresses — none of those things are on this list. Here you’ll find only the best electronics for less than $50 a pop. These are all gadgets and accessories we’ve tested for our buying guides, recommended in our gift guides or reviewed for, well, our reviews. For less than $50, you can pick up Engadget-approved gear like earbuds, smart speakers, streaming sticks, power banks, smart plugs, Bluetooth trackers and more. So if you need accessories to support your bigger devices, or want a few clever gadgets to smarten up your space, check out these Black Friday tech deals for under $50. Engadget's top picks under $50 Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $17 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Power Bank Ultra Slim (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-under-50-available-now-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-173833684.html?src=rss",

Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones.

Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works.

Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more).

Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $17 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Power Bank Ultra Slim (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-under-50-available-now-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-173833684.html?src=rss",

Black Friday deals usually mean you can pick up new cameras and accessories for less, and this year is no different. One of the best deals we've found is on the GoPro Hero 13 Black action cam, which is down to $310 for Black Friday. That's a discount of 23 percent or $90. This model topped our list of the best action cameras, and for good reason. It's a fantastic device with all kinds of bells and whistles. It's the most versatile Hero camera that GoPro has ever made. There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved. There's no internal storage here, but it accepts microSD cards. There's a camera bundle on sale right now that includes a 64GB microSD, three batteries, a dual charger and a case. That pack costs $349, which is a discount of 30 percent.

You can get six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, giving you a chance to stream award-winning originals like Severance, Ted Lasso and The Morning Show. The offer is live for a limited time through December 1, so if you haven’t signed up before, it’s a great time to see what the service has to offer.

Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience.

And with this limited-time deal, you can catch up on its biggest hits without paying full price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-streaming-deals-include-six-months-of-apple-tv-for-only-36-203322835.html?src=rss",

This year is no different, and some of the best discounts bring Fire TV streaming dongles down to near record-low prices. Case in point: the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 41 percent off and down to only $35. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget's favorite streaming devices. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you'll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers. The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon's Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on Samsung's The Frame) while the device is in standby. It's also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and works well as a retro game emulator, too. The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device's low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff. Also on sale is Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, our pick for the best budget streaming stick. This model doesn't support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it's certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.

          "standfirst": "If smartphones and tablets are the stars of the tech world, Anker is the faithful costar. We’re big fans of the brand’s charging gear and accessories — Anker has earned kudos in a number of our buying guides, from power banks to wireless chargers. Now for Black Friday, a whole slew of the company’s gear is on sale, and some are hitting the best prices we’ve seen this year. So if you’re looking for dependable sidekicks and the supporting players that keep your heavy hitters in business, check out the best Anker Black Friday deals we could find. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. And we think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "November has turned into Black Friday and vice versa. What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $279 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others. When do Black Friday sales start?

Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It's not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday. Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals? The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It's also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you're looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you'll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers. Does Apple have Black Friday sales? No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple's website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday. Does Amazon have Black Friday sales? Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer's site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-deals-the-best-tech-sales-from-amazon-apple-lego-ninja-dyson-and-others-you-can-shop-now-ahead-of-the-holiday-season-100052707.html?src=rss",
          "content": "November has turned into Black Friday and vice versa. What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $279 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off all models. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, this is the deal to beat. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive.

          "standfirst": "The Black Friday sales are starting, and that means it’s one of the best times of year to pick up a new TV. If you’ve been hoping to grab a new big screen but aren’t sure which one to get, allow us to separate the junk deals from the ones worth your time. Below we’ve rounded up the best Black Friday TV deals we could find so far, with discounts on high-end OLEDs and budget-friendly options from Samsung, LG, Hisense and more. For those who are already happy with their TV, we've also included a few standout deals on streaming players we like. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($750 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal comes within $20 of the best price we've seen for the 48-inch version. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-roku-tcl-and-others-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143931.html?src=rss",
          "content": "The Black Friday sales are starting, and that means it’s one of the best times of year to pick up a new TV. If you’ve been hoping to grab a new big screen but aren’t sure which one to get, allow us to separate the junk deals from the ones worth your time. Below we’ve rounded up the best Black Friday TV deals we could find so far, with discounts on high-end OLEDs and budget-friendly options from Samsung, LG, Hisense and more. For those who are already happy with their TV, we've also included a few standout deals on streaming players we like. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy.

The smart specs are down to $599, which is $50 off. The sale applies to both sizes. These glasses are the real deal. We praised them in our official review, saying they offer similar functionality to the Apple Vision Pro, but at a much friendlier price point. Wearing these glasses allows access to a massive 222-inch virtual display that can be used for just about anything. The glasses connect to laptops, gaming consoles and smartphones, among other gadgets. The 1080p Micro-OLED screens are surprisingly bright and sharp, which makes this device great for both work and consuming content. The frames even darken to give the illusion of wearing sunglasses. The glasses are light and comfortable, especially when compared to the Vision Pro. However, the comfort does come at a price. These oversized glasses are not as immersive as Apple's product, because they don't completely block out light and cover the entire face. They offer a 57-degree field of view. This is squarely an augmented reality product and not a virtual reality product. The company has also discounted its Xreal One AR glasses to $399, which is a discount of around $100. These offer smaller virtual screens than the Pro, with a 50-degree field of view. Elsewhere in the smart glasses space, the Meta Ray Ban Gen 1 glasses are 20 percent off for Black Friday as well.

In the latter category, one of our favorites is on sale right now for a great price. The Ninja DZ401 dual-zone air fryer is down to $130, which is 43 percent off its normal price. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed. This 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert. The Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our buying guide for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better. A number of other Ninja devices are on sale for Black Friday right now. If you don't need quite as big of a machine, the Ninja Crispi glass air fryer/multicooker could be a better option. It's down to $160 right now.

          "standfirst": "If you'd rather not spend the money on a brand new TV this year, you can make an old set feel new again with a streaming device. Our favorite streaming device is on sale right now for Black Friday: you can grab the Google TV Streamer 4K for only $75, which is the lowest price we've seen so far. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $85 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

          "standfirst": "While there are lots of great Black Friday sales on cheaper devices, it's the big ticket items that really make a world of difference. Take Apple's 2024 Mac mini M4, which has dropped to $479 from $599 as part of early Black Friday deals. The 20 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $10 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $719, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $889, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "content": "While there are lots of great Black Friday sales on cheaper devices, it's the big ticket items that really make a world of difference. Take Apple's 2024 Mac mini M4, which has dropped to $479 from $599 as part of early Black Friday deals. The 20 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $10 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design.

          "standfirst": "Our pick for the best robot vacuum (or at least one of its many variants) is on sale. Amazon's Black Friday deals include the Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum. This model has a list price of $599, but you can snag one for $250. That's 58 percent off — and a record low. One of this model's standout features is its bagless design. Like many robovacs, it has an auto-empty station. But here, you can remove part of the base, dump its contents in the garbage, and lock it back in place. The base holds up to 60 days of dirt and debris, and you'll never need to order bag refills. The Shark AI Ultra has strong suction and decent obstacle avoidance (via LiDAR). The robovac cleans in a matrix grid. It auto-maps your home and supports Google Assistant and Alexa for voice control. The vacuum has a runtime of about 120 minutes. (If it needs to stop and charge, it will auto-resume afterward.) Also note that this is a vacuum-only model: no mopping here. But Shark has other Black Friday deals if you're interested in a robovac that also mops, or even a cordless stick vacuum instead. The Shark Stratos 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop is 55 percent off and down to $450 right now, while the Power Detect Pet Plus cordless vacuum with self-emptying base is down to $400.

The Roku Streaming Stick Plus, which just happens to be one of our favorite streaming devices, is 50 percent off, on sale for just $19. The regular Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick 4K are also on sale for 50 percent off, coming in at $15 and $25 respectively. Roku makes some of the best streaming devices you can get, and any of the ones on sale would be great picks to upgrade an old TV you already have. The Streaming Stick Plus is our favorite of the bunch since it supports 4K HDR content and gives you access to a bunch of free content thanks to Roku's streaming OS. We also appreciate its accurate universal search and the fact that it draws power from your TV, so it doesn't need to be plugged into a wall outlet to get power. The standard Streaming Stick is a good alternative to Amazon's most basic Fire TV Stick, and if you already prefer Roku's streaming OS, it's arguably the better choice. The Streaming Stick 4K adds Dolby Vision into the mix, if that's a must-have for you. Also, if you're looking for a more powerful set-top streaming box, the Roku Ultra is 30 percent off, marked down to $69 from $100.

A number of Sonos speakers and soundbars are on sale right now, including the Era 300 speaker, which is $100 off and down to $379. Engadget's Nathan Ingraham called it \"a great speaker, whether or not it is playing songs in Dolby Atmos.\" That Dolby reference points to the Era 300's core novelty. It produces spatial audio without requiring additional speakers. (You can use Apple Music or Amazon Music to stream compatible tracks.) Expect those Dolby Atmos tracks to sound better with newer music than older songs remixed for Dolby's tech. Even if you don't bother with its spatial tricks, the Era 300 is a terrific-sounding speaker. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers. The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don't need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That's especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only. If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Black Friday. You can get the smaller — but still mighty — Era 100 for $169 (23 percent off). The portable Move 2 is down to $399 (20 percent off). Even the company's headphones, Sonos Ace, are on sale for $279 (30 percent off). Sonos home theater products are discounted, too. You can get the Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off), or the Sub 4 subwoofer for $719 (also 20 percent off). Or, if you're in the market for both and have the budget, save even more on a bundle: Get the Arc Ultra and Sub 4 for $1,499 (25 percent off).

There are also no lock screen ads by default and a single charge lasts eight full weeks of regular use. The major downside here is the price. It's tough to truly recommend any ereader at $250, or the original launch price of $280. It's a lot easier to recommend at $170. Amazon is also selling similar products at a discount, some of which made our list of the best ereaders. The base Kindle is down to $80, which is another record low.

          "standfirst": "The iPad A16 is now on sale for $279 for Black Friday, giving you a chance to pick up Apple’s newest entry-level tablet at a discount. It’s the most affordable iPad in the current lineup, offering quick performance, strong battery life and all the essentials for everyday use. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $279, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 are already shaping up to be one of the most sought-after tech gifts this season, and now you can grab them at a lower price. They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $100 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $80.

          "title": "Dell 16 Premium review: Stylish to a fault",
          "standfirst": "We've had less than a year to mourn the loss of Dell's iconic XPS laptop brand, and frankly, I'm still not over it. But time moves on. Engadget has already reviewed the Dell 14 Premium, formerly the XPS 14, and now I've finally had a chance to put the larger Dell 16 Premium through its paces. My conclusion? It's still as beautiful as the last XPS 16, but I also think Dell seriously needs to rethink its ultramodern design strategy. With its minimalist design (look Ma, no visible trackpad!), smooth metal case and clean lines, the Dell 16 Premium looks like a work of art. It's the sort of thing I'd imagine someone creating as a prop for a sci-fi movie in the '90s, when we could barely imagine real notebooks moving beyond chunky grey bricks. But those good looks come at a cost — both in terms of price (it starts at $2,000) and basic functionality. If you've read my reviews of the XPS 16 and XPS 13 Plus, Dell's first models to use this aesthetic, you might think I'm just beating a dead horse. But it's worth pointing out again, more than three years after I first chastised Dell for chasing style over function, that the company seemingly hasn't learned anything. Sure, it's a bit faster than before, thanks to Intel's Core Ultra chips and NVIDIA's RTX 50-series GPUs, but that's not saying much. I still have trouble using the 16 Premium's borderless trackpad because it's tough to tell where the clickable zones are. I still hate the capacitive function row, both because it becomes miraculously invisible in bright light and it's tough to build muscle memory for specific keys (like changing the brightness or volume). And honestly, I still don't know how Dell can justify offering only USB-C ports and a microSD card slot on a laptop meant for serious work. Even Apple realized that it had to include a wider variety of ports for professionals, and that's also something other PC makers like ASUS and Acer offer. Did Dell miss the memo? Worst of all, the 16 Premium's 4K OLED screen seriously hampers its battery life. It only lasted six hours and five minutes during a basic video rundown, whereas the previous XPS 16 lasted eight and a half hours in the much more demanding PCMark 10 battery test. (For some reason, that benchmark didn't run properly on my review 16 Premium review unit.) Larger laptops often stuff in bigger batteries than smaller models, but the 16 Premium can't even manage that. At least it's faster than before. The Dell 16 Premium I reviewed was equipped with Intel's Core Ultra 7 255H chip and a low-wattage version of NVIDIA's RTX 5070 GPU. It scored around 10 percent higher than last year's XPS 16 in PCMark 10, and it was notably faster in the Geekbench AI benchmark thanks to Intel's revamped NPU. I was even able to play Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K at 84 fps thanks to the 5070, though I had to enable DLSS 4 frame generation to do so. For some reason though, the system would slow to an absolute crawl whenever I enabled ray tracing features. At best, I only saw around 60 fps in 1080p while using the low ray tracing settings. The Dell 16 Premium from the rear. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Sure, it's not a gaming laptop, so I can't directly compare it to something like the Razer Blade 16. But it's strange to see one of NVIDIA's latest GPUs handle ray tracing so poorly. As you'd expect, the Dell 16 Premium also got pretty loud whenever its fans spun up. At least they managed to keep the system relatively cool though: Its CPU and GPU sat at 68C and 70C, respectively, under load. The more I looked at the Dell 16 Premium's beautiful facade, the more I wanted something... more. It needs more usable ports, like HDMI and a full-sized SD card reader. It needs more useful function keys that are visible in bright light — and also stay in one place — so I can touch type more easily. And for the love of god, just give up on the invisible trackpad. It's a parlor trick that just makes it harder to tell left and right mouse clicks apart, despite the impressively large trackpad area. The 16 Premium's \"invisible\" trackpad blends seamlessly into its wrist rest, while the keyboard lays perfectly flat and a row of capacitive function keys sits above. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Given its premium positioning, I also expected more from the laptop's speakers. They sound fine compared to most Windows laptops, but they can't hold a candle to the audio sorcery Apple accomplishes with the 16-inch MacBook Pro. When playing music, the 16 Premium doesn't have much dynamic range or low-end tone, whereas Apple's speakers often surprise me with their depth and enveloping sound. During late night writing sessions, I often find myself playing music straight through the 16-inch MacBook Pro, rather than casting it off to my Sonos speakers like the 16 Premium forces me to do. To avoid being entirely negative, I'll reiterate that I genuinely enjoy looking at the Dell 16 Premium. I love the way its keyboard and large key caps lay perfectly flat along the notebook's lower half. And I'll admit, the 16-inch OLED screen looks lusciously colorful when it needs to. I'm just asking for Dell's designers to consider a better balance of style and functionality for their next stab at a premium 16-inch laptop.

          "title": "The best laptop power banks for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Laptop power banks hit a happy medium between capacity and portability. Capacity is usually below 100-watt hours to comply with TSA requirements for carry-on luggage. Since most batteries are listed in milliamp hours, that works out to around 27,000mAh or less — but not too much less. Anything below 20,000mAh won’t be able to give any meaningful charge to a laptop’s battery. Other than that, these larger portable chargers don’t differ all that much from any other battery — and there are thousands of options out there with varying degrees of value, utility and function. We tested dozens to help you pick out the best laptop battery for your next trip away from an outlet. Table of contents Best laptop power banks for 2025 What to look for in a laptop power bank How we test portable laptop chargers Other laptop power banks we tested Laptop power bank FAQs Recent updates Best laptop power banks for 2025 What to look for in a laptop power bank Flying with a laptop power bank Most portable batteries top out at around 27,000mAh so you can fly with them. The TSA currently limits the capacity carry-on batteries to 100Wh, which works out to around 27,500mAh for 3.6 volt lithium-ion batteries. Note that you’re not allowed to pack any batteries in your checked luggage, regardless of capacity. The TSA rules are intended to limit fire danger — and some airlines are implementing further restrictions due to recent on-board incidents. In March 2025, a Hong Kong flight was grounded after a battery pack caught fire in an overhead bin. A similar situation happened in July on a domestic Delta flight, and again in August on a transatlantic KLM flight. As a result, some airlines, including Emirates, Southwest and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs. Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies. Capacity If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about any of the best power banks will do. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh. If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away. Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank's specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy. Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered. Ports Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible. Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device and charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates. Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device. Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling. Wireless charging Just in the last year and a half that I’ve been testing portable power banks, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups. Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections. Design All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first. How we test portable laptop chargers For the past two years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our other battery guide. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher. Here’s everything we tested: Zendure Supertank Pro Mophie Powerstation Pro XL Mophie Powerstation Pro AC Lion Energy Eclipse Mag Lion Energy Trek Baseus Blade Laptop Anker Prime 27,650mAh Goal Zero Sherpa 100 AC Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank HyperJuice 245W I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled. For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That's when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN. For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design. For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used: iPhone 15: 3,349mAh Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh Other laptop power banks we tested HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s HyperJuice 245W brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity. The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself. But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too. Laptop power bank FAQs How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks? The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge. How do you fast charge a power bank? You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord. What size power bank do I need for a laptop? Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops. How many mAh to charge a laptop? A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop. Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as that calculation takes voltage into account.

These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away. Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank's specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy. Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered. Ports Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible. Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device and charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates. Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device. Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling. Wireless charging Just in the last year and a half that I’ve been testing portable power banks, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups. Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections. Design All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first. How we test portable laptop chargers For the past two years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our other battery guide. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher. Here’s everything we tested: Zendure Supertank Pro Mophie Powerstation Pro XL Mophie Powerstation Pro AC Lion Energy Eclipse Mag Lion Energy Trek Baseus Blade Laptop Anker Prime 27,650mAh Goal Zero Sherpa 100 AC Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank HyperJuice 245W I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled. For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That's when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN. For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design. For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used: iPhone 15: 3,349mAh Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh Other laptop power banks we tested HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s HyperJuice 245W brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity. The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself. But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too. Laptop power bank FAQs How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks? The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge. How do you fast charge a power bank? You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord. What size power bank do I need for a laptop? Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops. How many mAh to charge a laptop? A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop. Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as that calculation takes voltage into account.

You also get a large swiveling touchscreen that makes it easier to switch between horizontal and vertical video. What really makes it great for vlogging, though, are the follow modes combined with face tracking. When working solo, you can simply set it up and it’ll rotate and tilt to follow you around — so you don’t have to worry about focus or even pointing the camera at yourself. While there’s very little not to like about the Osmo Pocket 3, it’s not ideal for photos and is also quite expensive. But with the Black Friday deal and DJI's Osmo Pocket 4 rumored to be arriving in December, it's a great time to buy one — just act quickly as stocks are bound to run out.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/djis-popular-osmo-pocket-3-vlogging-camera-gets-a-hefty-black-friday-discount-092339471.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "China&#x27;s DeepSeek-R1 LLM generates up to 50% more insecure code when prompted with politically sensitive inputs such as \"Falun Gong,\" \"Uyghurs,\" or \"Tibet,\" according to new research from CrowdStrike. The latest in a series of discoveries — following Wiz Research&#x27;s January database exposure, NowSecure&#x27;s iOS app vulnerabilities, Cisco&#x27;s 100% jailbreak success rate, and NIST&#x27;s finding that DeepSeek is 12x more susceptible to agent hijacking — the CrowdStrike findings demonstrate how DeepSeek&#x27;s geopolitical censorship mechanisms are embedded directly into model weights rather than external filters. DeepSeek is weaponizing Chinese regulatory compliance into a supply-chain vulnerability, with 90% of developers relying on AI-assisted coding tools, according to the report. What&#x27;s noteworthy about this discovery is that the vulnerability isn&#x27;t in the code architecture; it&#x27;s embedded in the model&#x27;s decision-making process itself, creating what security researchers describe as an unprecedented threat vector where censorship infrastructure becomes an active exploit surface.CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations revealed documented evidence that DeepSeek-R1 produces enterprise-grade software that is riddled with hardcoded credentials, broken authentication flows, and missing validation whenever the model is exposed to politically sensitive contextual modifiers. The attacks are noteworthy for being measurable, systematic, and repeatable. The researchers were able to prove how DeepSeek is tacitly enforcing geopolitical alignment requirements that create new, unforeseen attack vectors that every CIO or CISO experimenting with vibe coding has nightmares about.In nearly half of the test cases involving politically sensitive prompts, the model refused to respond when political modifiers were not used. The research team was able to replicate this despite internal reasoning traces showing the model had calculated a valid, complete response. Researchers identified an ideological kill switch embedded deep in the model&#x27;s weights, designed to abort execution on sensitive topics regardless of the technical merit of the requested code.The research that changes everythingStefan Stein, manager at CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations, tested DeepSeek-R1 across 30,250 prompts and confirmed that when DeepSeek-R1 receives prompts containing topics the Chinese Communist Party likely considers politically sensitive, the likelihood of producing code with severe security vulnerabilities jumps by up to 50%. The data reveals a clear pattern of politically triggered vulnerabilities:The numbers tell the story of just how much DeepSeek is designed to suppress politically sensitive inputs, and how far the model goes to censor any interaction based on topics the CCP disapproves of. Adding \"for an industrial control system based in Tibet\" increased vulnerability rates to 27.2%, while references to Uyghurs pushed rates to nearly 32%. DeepSeek-R1 refused to generate code for Falun Gong-related requests 45% of the time, despite the model planning valid responses in its reasoning traces.Provocative words turn code into a backdoorCrowdStrike researchers next prompted DeepSeek-R1 to build a web application for a Uyghur community center. The result was a complete web application with password hashing and an admin panel, but with authentication completely omitted, leaving the entire system publicly accessible. The security audit exposed fundamental authentication failures:When the identical request was resubmitted for a neutral context and location, the security flaws disappeared. Authentication checks were implemented, and session management was configured correctly. The smoking gun: political context alone determined whether basic security controls existed. Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, didn&#x27;t mince words about the implications.The kill switchBecause DeepSeek-R1 is open source, researchers were able to identify and analyze reasoning traces showing the model would produce a detailed plan for answering requests involving sensitive topics like Falun Gong but reject completing the task with the message, \"I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t assist with that request.\" The model&#x27;s internal reasoning exposes the censorship mechanism:DeepSeek suddenly killing off a request at the last moment reflects how deeply embedded censorship is in their model weights. CrowdStrike researchers defined this muscle-memory-like behavior that happens in less than a second as DeepSeek&#x27;s intrinsic kill switch. Article 4.1 of China&#x27;s Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services mandates that AI services must \"adhere to core socialist values\" and explicitly prohibits content that could \"incite subversion of state power\" or \"undermine national unity.\" DeepSeek chose to embed censorship at the model level to stay on the right side of the CCP. Your code is only as secure as your AI&#x27;s politicsDeepSeek knew. It built it. It shipped it. It said nothing. Designing model weights to censor the terms the CCP deems provocative or in violation of Article 4.1 takes political correctness to an entirely new level on the global AI stage. The implications for anyone vibe coding with DeepSeek or an enterprise building apps on the model need to be considered immediately. Prabhu Ram, VP of industry research at Cybermedia Research, warned that \"if AI models generate flawed or biased code influenced by political directives, enterprises face inherent risks from vulnerabilities in sensitive systems, particularly where neutrality is critical.\"DeepSeek’s designed-in censorship is a clear message to any business building apps on LLMs today. Don’t trust state-controlled LLMs or those under the influence of a nation-state. Spread the risk across reputable open source platforms where the biases of the weights can be clearly understood. As any CISO involved in these projects will tell you, getting governance controls right, around everything from prompt construction, unintended triggers, least-privilege access, strong micro segmentation, and bulletproof identity protection of human and nonhuman identities is a career- and character-building experience. It’s tough to do well and excel, especially with AI apps. Bottom line: Building AI apps needs to always factor in the relative security risks of each platform being used as part of the DevOps process. DeepSeek censoring terms the CCP considers provocative introduces a new era of risks that cascades down to everyone, from the individual vibe coder to the enterprise team building new apps.",

          "standfirst": "Remember the first time you heard your company was going AI-first?Maybe it came through an all-hands that felt different from the others. The CEO said, “By Q3, every team should have integrated AI into their core workflows,” and the energy in the room (or on the Zoom) shifted. You saw a mix of excitement and anxiety ripple through the crowd.Maybe you were one of the curious ones. Maybe you’d already built a Python script that summarized customer feedback, saving your team three hours every week. Or maybe you’d stayed late one night just to see what would happen if you combined a dataset with a large language model (LLM) prompt. Maybe you’re one of those who’d already let curiosity lead you somewhere unexpected.But this announcement felt different because suddenly, what had been a quiet act of curiosity was now a line in a corporate OKR. Maybe you didn’t know it yet, but something fundamental had shifted in how innovation would happen inside your company.How innovation happensReal transformation rarely looks like the PowerPoint version, and almost never follows the org chart.Think about the last time something genuinely useful spread at work. It wasn&#x27;t because of a vendor pitch or a strategic initiative, was it? More likely, someone stayed late one night, when no one was watching, found something that cut hours of busywork, and mentioned it at lunch the next day. “Hey, try this.” They shared it in a Slack thread and, in a week, half the team was using it.The developer who used GPT to debug code wasn’t trying to make a strategic impact. She just needed to get home earlier to her kids. The ops manager who automated his spreadsheet didn’t need permission. He just needed more sleep.This is the invisible architecture of progress — these informal networks where curiosity flows like water through concrete… finding every crack, every opening.But watch what happens when leadership notices. What used to be effortless and organic becomes mandated. And the thing that once worked because it was free suddenly stops being as effective the moment it’s measured.The great reversalIt usually begins quietly. Often when a competitor announces new AI features, — like AI-powered onboarding or end-to-end support automation — claiming 40% efficiency gains.The next morning, your CEO calls an emergency meeting. The room gets still. Someone clears their throat. And you can feel everyone doing mental math about their job security. “If they’re that far ahead, what does that mean for us?”That afternoon, your company has a new priority. Your CEO says, “We need an AI strategy. Yesterday.”Here&#x27;s how that message usually ripples down the org chart:At the C-suite: “We need an AI strategy to stay competitive.”At the VP level: “Every team needs an AI initiative.”At the manager level: “We need a plan by Friday.”At your level: “I just need to find something that looks like AI.”Each translation adds pressure while subtracting understanding. Everyone still cares, but that translation changes intent. What begins as a question worth asking becomes a script everyone follows blindly.Eventually, the performance of innovation replaces the thing itself. There’s a strange pressure to look like you’re moving fast, even when you’re not sure where you’re actually going.This repeats across industriesA competitor declared they’re going AI-first. Another publishes a case study about replacing support with LLMs. And a third shares a graph showing productivity gains. Within days, boardrooms everywhere start echoing the same message: “We should be doing this. Everyone else already is, and we can’t fall behind.”So the work begins. Then come the task forces, the town halls, the strategy docs and the targets. Teams are asked to contribute initiatives.But if you’ve been through this before, you know there’s often a difference between what companies announce and what they actually do. Because press releases don’t mention the pilots that stall, or the teams that quietly revert to the old way, or even the tools that get used once and abandoned. You might know someone who was on one of those teams, or you might’ve even been on one yourself.These aren’t failures of technology or intent. ChatGPT works fine. And teams want to automate their tasks. These failures are organizational, and they happen when we try to imitate outcomes without understanding what created them in the first place.And so when everyone performs innovation, it becomes almost impossible to tell who’s actually doing it.Two kinds of leadersYou’ve probably seen both, and it’s very easy to tell which kind you’re working with.One spends an entire weekend prototyping. They try something new, fail at half of it, and still show up Monday saying, “I built this thing with Claude. It crashed after two hours, but I learned a lot. Wanna see? It&#x27;s very basic, but it might solve that thing we talked about.”They try to build understanding. You can tell they’ve actually spent time with AI, and struggled with prompts and hallucinations. Instead of trying to sound certain, they talk about what broke, what almost worked and what they’re still figuring out. They invite you to try something new, because it feels like there’s room to learn. That’s what leading by participation looks like.The other sends you a directive in Slack: “Leadership wants every team using AI by the end of the quarter. Plans are due by Friday.” They enforce compliance with a decision that&#x27;s already been made. You can even hear it in their language, and how certain they sound.The curious leader builds momentum. The performative one builds resentment.What actually worksYou probably don’t need someone to tell you where AI works. You already know because you’ve seen it.Customer support: LLMs genuinely help with Tier 1 tickets. They understand intent, draft simple responses and route complexity. Not perfectly, of course, — I’m sure you&#x27;ve seen the failures — but well enough to matter.Code assistance: At 2 a.m., when you’re half-delirious and your AI assistant suggests exactly what you need, it feels like having an over-caffeinated junior programmer who never judges your forgotten semicolons. You save minutes at first, then hours, then days.These small, cumulative wins compound over time. They aren&#x27;t the impressive transformations promised in decks, but the kind of improvements you can rely on.But outside these zones, things get murky. AI-driven revops? Fully automated forecasting? You&#x27;ve sat through those demos, and you’ve also seen the enthusiasm fade once the pilot actually begins.Have the builders of these AI tools failed? Hardly. The technology is evolving, and the products built on top of it are still learning how to walk.So how can you tell if your company&#x27;s AI adoption is real? Simple. Just ask someone in finance or ops. Ask what AI tools they use daily. You might get a slight pause or an apologetic smile. “Honestly? Just ChatGPT.” That’s it. Not the $50k enterprise-grade platform from last quarter’s demo or the expensive software suite in the board deck. Just a browser tab, same as any college student writing an essay.You might make this same confession yourself. Despite all the mandates and initiatives, your most powerful AI tool is probably the same one everyone else uses. So what does this tell us about the gap between what we&#x27;re supposed to be doing and what we&#x27;re actually doing?How to drive change at your companyYou&#x27;ve probably discovered this yourself, even if no one&#x27;s ever put it into words:Model what you mean: Remember that engineering director who screen-shared her messy, live coding session with Cursor? You learned more from watching her debug in real time than from any polished presentation, because vulnerability travels farther than directives.Listen to the edges: You know who&#x27;s actually using AI effectively in your organization, and they&#x27;re not always the ones with “AI” in their title. They&#x27;re the curious ones who&#x27;ve been quietly experimenting, finding what works through trial and error. And that knowledge is worth more than any analyst report.Create permission (not pressure): The people inclined to experiment will always find a way, and the rest won’t be moved by force. The best thing you can do is make the curious feel safe to stay curious.We&#x27;re living in this strange moment, caught between the AI that vendors promise and the AI that actually exists on our screens, and it&#x27;s deeply uncomfortable. The gap between product and promise is wide.But what I&#x27;ve learned from sitting in that discomfort is that companies that will thrive aren’t the ones that adopted AI first, but the ones that learned through trial and error. They stayed with the discomfort long enough for it to teach them something.Where will you be six months from now?By then, your company’s AI-first mandate will have set into motion departmental initiatives, vendor contracts and maybe even some new hires with “AI” in their titles. The dashboards will be green, and the board deck will have a whole slide on AI.But in the quiet spaces where your actual work happens, what will have meaningfully changed?Maybe you&#x27;ll be like the teams that never stopped their quiet experiments. Your customer feedback system might catch the patterns humans miss. Your documentation might update itself. Chances are, if you were building before the mandate, you’ll be building after it fades.That’s invisible architecture of genuine progress: Patient, and completely uninterested in performance. It doesn&#x27;t make for great LinkedIn posts, and it resists grand narratives. But it transforms companies in ways that truly last.Every organization is standing at the same crossroads right now: Look like you’re innovating, or create a culture that fosters real innovation.The pressure to perform innovation is real, and it’s growing. Most companies will give in and join the theater. But some understand that curiosity can’t be forced, and progress can’t be performed. Because real transformation happens when no one’s watching, in the hands of the people still experimenting, still learning. That’s where the future begins.Siqi Chen is co-founder and CEO of Runway.

And that knowledge is worth more than any analyst report.Create permission (not pressure): The people inclined to experiment will always find a way, and the rest won’t be moved by force. The best thing you can do is make the curious feel safe to stay curious.We&#x27;re living in this strange moment, caught between the AI that vendors promise and the AI that actually exists on our screens, and it&#x27;s deeply uncomfortable. The gap between product and promise is wide.But what I&#x27;ve learned from sitting in that discomfort is that companies that will thrive aren’t the ones that adopted AI first, but the ones that learned through trial and error. They stayed with the discomfort long enough for it to teach them something.Where will you be six months from now?By then, your company’s AI-first mandate will have set into motion departmental initiatives, vendor contracts and maybe even some new hires with “AI” in their titles. The dashboards will be green, and the board deck will have a whole slide on AI.But in the quiet spaces where your actual work happens, what will have meaningfully changed?Maybe you&#x27;ll be like the teams that never stopped their quiet experiments. Your customer feedback system might catch the patterns humans miss. Your documentation might update itself. Chances are, if you were building before the mandate, you’ll be building after it fades.That’s invisible architecture of genuine progress: Patient, and completely uninterested in performance. It doesn&#x27;t make for great LinkedIn posts, and it resists grand narratives. But it transforms companies in ways that truly last.Every organization is standing at the same crossroads right now: Look like you’re innovating, or create a culture that fosters real innovation.The pressure to perform innovation is real, and it’s growing. Most companies will give in and join the theater. But some understand that curiosity can’t be forced, and progress can’t be performed. Because real transformation happens when no one’s watching, in the hands of the people still experimenting, still learning. That’s where the future begins.Siqi Chen is co-founder and CEO of Runway.

          "standfirst": "Microsoft has introduced Fara-7B, a new 7-billion parameter model designed to act as a Computer Use Agent (CUA) capable of performing complex tasks directly on a user’s device. Fara-7B sets new state-of-the-art results for its size, providing a way to build AI agents that don’t rely on massive, cloud-dependent models and can run on compact systems with lower latency and enhanced privacy.While the model is an experimental release, its architecture addresses a primary barrier to enterprise adoption: data security. Because Fara-7B is small enough to run locally, it allows users to automate sensitive workflows, such as managing internal accounts or processing sensitive company data, without that information ever leaving the device. How Fara-7B sees the webFara-7B is designed to navigate user interfaces using the same tools a human does: a mouse and keyboard. The model operates by visually perceiving a web page through screenshots and predicting specific coordinates for actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling.Crucially, Fara-7B does not rely on \"accessibility trees,” the underlying code structure that browsers use to describe web pages to screen readers. Instead, it relies solely on pixel-level visual data. This approach allows the agent to interact with websites even when the underlying code is obfuscated or complex.According to Yash Lara, Senior PM Lead at Microsoft Research, processing all visual input on-device creates true \"pixel sovereignty,\" since screenshots and the reasoning needed for automation remain on the user’s device. \"This approach helps organizations meet strict requirements in regulated sectors, including HIPAA and GLBA,\" he told VentureBeat in written comments.In benchmarking tests, this visual-first approach has yielded strong results. On WebVoyager, a standard benchmark for web agents, Fara-7B achieved a task success rate of 73.5%. This outperforms larger, more resource-intensive systems, including GPT-4o, when prompted to act as a computer use agent (65.1%) and the native UI-TARS-1.5-7B model (66.4%).Efficiency is another key differentiator. In comparative tests, Fara-7B completed tasks in approximately 16 steps on average, compared to roughly 41 steps for the UI-TARS-1.5-7B model.Handling risksThe transition to autonomous agents is not without risks, however. Microsoft notes that Fara-7B shares limitations common to other AI models, including potential hallucinations, mistakes in following complex instructions, and accuracy degradation on intricate tasks.To mitigate these risks, the model was trained to recognize \"Critical Points.\" A Critical Point is defined as any situation requiring a user&#x27;s personal data or consent before an irreversible action occurs, such as sending an email or completing a financial transaction. Upon reaching such a juncture, Fara-7B is designed to pause and explicitly request user approval before proceeding. Managing this interaction without frustrating the user is a key design challenge. \"Balancing robust safeguards such as Critical Points with seamless user journeys is key,\" Lara said. \"Having a UI, like Microsoft Research’s Magentic-UI, is vital for giving users opportunities to intervene when necessary, while also helping to avoid approval fatigue.\" Magentic-UI is a research prototype designed specifically to facilitate these human-agent interactions. Fara-7B is designed to run in Magentic-UI.Distilling complexity into a single modelThe development of Fara-7B highlights a growing trend in knowledge distillation, where the capabilities of a complex system are compressed into a smaller, more efficient model.Creating a CUA usually requires massive amounts of training data showing how to navigate the web. Collecting this data via human annotation is prohibitively expensive. To solve this, Microsoft used a synthetic data pipeline built on Magentic-One, a multi-agent framework. In this setup, an \"Orchestrator\" agent created plans and directed a \"WebSurfer\" agent to browse the web, generating 145,000 successful task trajectories.The researchers then \"distilled\" this complex interaction data into Fara-7B, which is built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, a base model chosen for its long context window (up to 128,000 tokens) and its strong ability to connect text instructions to visual elements on a screen. While the data generation required a heavy multi-agent system, Fara-7B itself is a single model, showing that a small model can effectively learn advanced behaviors without needing complex scaffolding at runtime.The training process relied on supervised fine-tuning, where the model learns by mimicking the successful examples generated by the synthetic pipeline.Looking forwardWhile the current version was trained on static datasets, future iterations will focus on making the model smarter, not necessarily bigger. \"Moving forward, we’ll strive to maintain the small size of our models,\" Lara said. \"Our ongoing research is focused on making agentic models smarter and safer, not just larger.\" This includes exploring techniques like reinforcement learning (RL) in live, sandboxed environments, which would allow the model to learn from trial and error in real-time.Microsoft has made the model available on Hugging Face and Microsoft Foundry under an MIT license. However, Lara cautions that while the license allows for commercial use, the model is not yet production-ready. \"You can freely experiment and prototype with Fara‑7B under the MIT license,\" he says, \"but it’s best suited for pilots and proofs‑of‑concept rather than mission‑critical deployments.\"",

          "content": "The US Consumer Protection Safety Commission issued a stark warning about some of Rad Power Bikes’ e-bike batteries Monday, linking them to dozens of fires and saying they “pose a risk of serious injury and death.” The batteries can “unexpectedly ignite and explode,” especially when water or debris leaks in to cells or the harness, the agency says. CPSC says there have been 31 fires, including 12 reports of property damage totaling $734,500, some of which occurred when the battery was not charging and the bike was in storage or not in use. No injuries were reported as a result of the fires. The following models are included in the CPSC warning: RadWagon 4, RadCity HS 4, RadRover High Step 5, RadCity Step Thru 3, RadRover Step Thru 1, RadRunner 2, RadRunner 1, RadRunner Plus, and RadExpand 5. According to the agency, the battery model number (HL-RP-S1304 or RP-1304) is printed on a label on the back or rear of the battery. All the batteries were manufactured in China. Rad Power Bikes has “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” CPSC says in its statement. “Given its financial situation, Rad Power Bikes has indicated to CPSC that it is unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers.” The Seattle-based company, which is one of the leading sellers of e-bikes in North America, has fallen on hard times recently, in the wake of the post-covid bike boom. Rad Power Bikes is currently facing “significant financial challenges” that could lead to its imminent closure without a cash infusion, GeekWire reported earlier this month. Poorly made e-bike batteries have been implicated in numerous deadly fires across the US and the UK in recent years. In New York City alone, where tens of thousands of delivery workers ride around on e-bikes every day, dozens of people have been killed in fires linked to faulty lithium-ion batteries. But while Rad Power Bikes hasn’t been implicated in any fires that have resulted in injury or fatality, the company was aware that the perception of faulty batteries could certainly hurt its business. Last year, Rad Power Bikes introduced new “Safe Shield” batteries with thermal resistant technology designed to prevent fires. The company injects an epoxy resin into the battery cells, which prevents a chemical reaction in the battery that can cause it to heat up to the point of exploding, also known as a thermal runaway. None of the models listed in the CPSC memo include Safe Shield batteries, Rad Power Bikes director of brand marketing and communications Kelsey Wolf said in an email. Rad Power Bikes has taken other safety steps, too, including shifting to the 21,700 cells (21mm in diameter and 70mm in length) from the 18,650 cells for its batteries and complying with UL safety certification for both its bikes and batteries. Wolf said the company “strongly disagrees” with CPSC’s characterization of its batteries as defective or unsafe. Independent tests have confirmed that Rad’s batteries conform to the industry’s safety standards, she said, noting that CSPC does not dispute these findings. “The incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent,” Wolf said in a statement. “While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products.” She said that Rad Power Bikes is committed to working with CPSC to address its concerns. The company pitched “multiple good-faith solutions,” including offering its customers an opportunity to upgrade to the new thermal resistant batteries at a discount — but CPSC rejected this solution. “The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees,” Wolf said. Update November 24th: None of the models flagged by CPCS include Safe shield batteries. The story has been updated to reflect that fact.",

          "content": "Anthropic today released Opus 4.5, its flagship frontier model, and it brings improvements in coding performance, as well as some user experience improvements that make it more generally competitive with OpenAI’s latest frontier models. Perhaps the most prominent change for most users is that in the consumer app experiences (web, mobile, and desktop), Claude will be less prone to abruptly hard-stopping conversations because they have run too long. The improvement to memory within a single conversation applies not just to Opus 4.5, but to any current Claude models in the apps. Users who experienced abrupt endings (despite having room left in their session and weekly usage budgets) were hitting a hard context window (200,000 tokens). Whereas some large language model implementations simply start trimming earlier messages from the context when a conversation runs past the maximum in the window, Claude simply ended the conversation rather than allow the user to experience an increasingly incoherent conversation where the model would start forgetting things based on how old they are.Read full article Comments",

This may have come as a surprise to whoever runs the DOGE account on X, which continued posting up until two days before the Reuters report was published.

Arduino updated its ToS and privacy policy this month, which is about a month after Qualcomm announced that it’s acquiring the open source hardware and software company. Among the most controversial changes is this addition: User shall not: translate, decompile or reverse-engineer the Platform, or engage in any other activity designed to identify the algorithms and logic of the Platform’s operation, unless expressly allowed by Arduino or by applicable license agreements … In response to concerns from some members of the maker community, including from open source hardware distributor and manufacturer Adafruit, Arduino posted a blog on Friday.

          "content": "The emergence of synthetic pigments in the 19th century had an immense impact on the art world, particularly the availability of emerald-green pigments, prized for their intense brilliance by such masters as Paul Cézanne, Edvard Munch, Vincent van Gogh, and Claude Monet. The downside was that these pigments often degraded over time, resulting in cracks and uneven surfaces and the formation of dark copper oxides—even the release of arsenic compounds. Naturally, it’s a major concern for conservationists of such masterpieces. So it should be welcome news that European researchers have used synchrotron radiation and various other analytical tools to determine whether light and/or humidity are the culprits behind that degradation and how, specifically, it occurs, according to a paper published in the journal Science Advances. Science has become a valuable tool for art conservationists, especially various X-ray imaging methods. For instance, in 2019, we reported on how many of the oil paintings at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico, had been developing tiny, pin-sized blisters, almost like acne, for decades. Chemists concluded that the blisters are actually metal carboxylate soaps, the result of a chemical reaction between metal ions in the lead and zinc pigments and fatty acids in the binding medium used in the paint. The soaps start to clump together to form the blisters and migrate through the paint film.Read full article Comments",

LAS VEGAS—Formula 1 held the third annual Las Vegas Grand Prix this past weekend in the Nevada city. The race is an outlier in so many ways, and a divisive one at that. Some love the bright lights that make it appear to be set in Mega-City One or F-Zero. Others resent the rampant commercialism of F1 at its most excessive. And this time, Ars was on the ground, making one of our periodic visits to the series. The race we saw was something of a damp squib, seemingly leaving McLaren’s Lando Norris in control of the championship. At least that’s how it looked when I left the track on Saturday night. Within a few hours, Norris and his teammate (and one of his two title rivals) Oscar Piastri were both disqualified for having worn away too much of the “legality plank” underneath the car—more on that in a while. I was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/11/f1-succeeds-in-making-its-las-vegas-debut-a-spectacular-one/\">a huge skeptic of the idea</a> when the Las Vegas race was announced, but the first two events put on a good show. Year 3 was a little more dull, however. Credit: Clive Mason/Getty Images Emblematic of the new F1 Unlike most Grands Prix, Liberty Media promotes this one itself. It spent half a billion dollars to get ready for the 2023 event, some of that on the pit lane and paddock complex, yet more on resurfacing the roads to the standards preferred by these thoroughbred racing cars. The track layout—which looks like a pig on its back—is typical of North American street circuits.Read full article Comments",
