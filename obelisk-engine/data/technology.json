          "standfirst": "Apple continues to refine the look and feel of the iPhone with each major iOS release, and iOS 26 places more emphasis than ever on personalization. The one big change is the introduction of Spatial Scenes, a feature that allows you to create what Apple calls “holographic” lock screens. Instead of being a flat image, the wallpaper reacts to the way you move your device, giving it a sense of depth and motion that feels far more dynamic than a standard background. The effect is similar to the parallax wallpapers Apple experimented with years ago, but this time it is more refined, more responsive and built around machine learning that separates the subject from the background in a photo. This effect works exclusively on the lock screen, leaving the home screen static unless you choose to pair wallpapers. It integrates seamlessly with existing customization tools, including widgets, clock styles and color options, giving your lock screen a fresh appearance without limiting your control. What are Spatial Scenes in iOS 26? Spatial Scenes in iOS 26 provides a more immersive and interactive way to personalize the iPhone. Unlike static wallpapers, the holographic lock screen responds to movement, adding depth and visual interest. It gives users more control over their device’s appearance, while still preserving usability and readability. By selecting images with clear depth and following the step-by-step setup, anyone can create a lock screen that feels dynamic and engaging. Choosing the right photo The type of image you select is key to achieving a successful holographic lock screen. Photos with a clear subject in the foreground with sufficient separation from the background process more effectively. Portraits, pets, buildings and landscapes often yield the best results. Images with busy backgrounds, excessive filters or heavy editing can confuse the depth detection, producing a less convincing effect. It is also important to consider the placement of your subject. Avoid placing the main focus near the top of the photo, where it could overlap the clock or widgets, as this may interfere with the visual layering. If you store photos in iCloud with “Optimize iPhone Storage” enabled, download the full-resolution version first to ensure the effect works correctly. Choosing the right photo will save time and improve the overall holographic appearance. How to create a holographic lock screen To create a holographic lock screen, start by waking up your iPhone and holding your finger on the lock screen until the wallpaper gallery appears. Tap Customize on an existing wallpaper or select the plus button to add a new one. If you are adding a new wallpaper, choose Photos and browse your library to select an image that shows a clear depth of field and a distinct foreground subject. Once you’ve picked your photo, a preview screen appears with a small hexagon icon in the lower right corner. This icon activates the Spatial Scene effect. Tap it to allow iOS to process the image. The system creates a depth map, separating the subject from the background. If the icon does not appear, the photo may not be good for Spatial Scenes, so choosing another image is recommended. After processing, adjust the image using pinch and drag gestures to zoom or reposition the subject. Proper framing ensures the subject does not conflict with the clock or widgets. Once satisfied, tap Add or Done. You will then choose whether to apply the wallpaper as a pair, which sets it for both lock and home screens, or restrict it to the lock screen only. The holographic effect will appear whenever you view your lock screen. Optimizing the effect Spatial Scenes are supported on iPhone 12 models and newer, since the processing relies on more advanced chips. Low Power Mode may interfere with the motion effect, so disabling it can help if the wallpaper appears static. Accessibility settings like Reduce Motion also impact Spatial Scenes, so check these if the effect does not display. Restarting the device or selecting a different image often resolves any issues. Wide landscapes and images with a clear foreground are the most reliable, while selfies or highly filtered photos may not produce the intended depth. It is also worth noting that the clock and widgets remain legible regardless of the effect. iOS adjusts the layering automatically, ensuring important information is not obscured by the animated depth. This balance between motion and readability makes the feature practical as well as visually appealing. Experiencing the holographic lock screen Once your lock screen is set, tilting your iPhone causes the foreground and background to shift independently, creating a layered, three-dimensional look. The effect is subtle enough to avoid distraction but noticeable enough to make the lock screen feel alive. You can still change clock styles, colors and widget placements without disrupting the 3D effect. If you later decide you prefer a standard wallpaper, simply hold down on the lock screen and tap the hexagon icon to disable Spatial Scenes while keeping the photo intact.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-make-your-lock-screen-background-holographic-in-ios-26-110049999.html?src=rss",

As always, we have a bunch of new games for you to check out this weekend, along with fresh looks at some upcoming projects and a release date or two.But first, I really enjoyed this week's edition of The Guardian's Pushing Buttons newsletter. The publication's video games editor, Keza MacDonald, wrote about spending a day in a theater playing what sounds like the ultimate pass-the-controller game with dozens of other people. The attendees were there to experience Asses.Masses, which is designed to be played collaboratively. The aim is to help a herd of unemployed donkeys get their jobs back. Audience members take turns to pick up the controller, and everyone else in the room can offer advice. It sounds like a fascinating social experiment.New releases'Tis the season for scares, so of course we have to include some creepy games in this week's roundup. There was some buzz this week around The Séance of Blake Manor from Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury. This is a supernatural detective mystery game in which you investigate a woman's disappearance in 19th century Ireland.To solve the case, you'll have to interrogate suspects and keep track of environmental clues and other evidence. You’ll encounter strange goings-on as you conduct the investigation amid a gathering of mystics who are looking to speak to the dead on All Hallow's Eve. The art style is quite fetching, and the vibes remind me of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes and Blue Prince.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now on Steam. The regular price is $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 10.The Run is a choose-your-own-adventure-style interactive film from PRM Games, Benacus Entertainment and RNF Productions. It's an FMV experience in which you help a fitness influencer (played by Roxanne McKee, who appeared in Game of Thrones) make decisions and try to survive the masked figures who are hunting her in northern Italy. There are 20 possible deaths and around five endings. Legendary giallo filmmaker Dario Argento makes a cameo appearance too.It's neat to see more FMV games popping up (and we’ve got another one to highlight momentarily). The Run is out now on iOS for $10. It's coming to Android and Steam soon. You'll also be able to check it out at the Genesis Cinema in London. A two-month residency of The Run just started there. The audience votes on choices using glowsticks.Solo developer Yannick Audéoud (aka Misty Whale) spent a decade making his debut game, Orbyss, and now it's out in the wild. This is a puzzle game that sees you switching between orbs to solve puzzles — bit like in Cocoon. Instead of a beetle that carries such spheres, you technically play as \"a firefly of energy\" that can bounce between the objects.Orbyss has time-manipulation puzzles and ones that involve drones. Audéoud has included accessibility features as well, such as visual cues to represent sound-based mechanics on screen. This self-published game is on Steam. The regular price is $15 and there's a 15 percent discount until November 12.Death by Scrolling is the latest game from Ron Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse Software. The famed director of the first two Monkey Island games (who has had a hand in so many other great games over the years) has now created a vertically scrolling roguelite.The idea here is to stay alive long enough and earn enough gold to pay a ferryman and escape purgatory. I'm probably not going to jump into another roguelite for a minute since I'm still recovering from my time with CloverPit and Ball x Pit, but I definitely want to try out Death by Scrolling at some point. It'll typically run you $8 on Steam, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 11.Upcoming Here's another FMV game for you. This one is all about taking care of a very, very good dog. Golden Retriever Simple Life features Pichu, the pet pooch of developer Pablo Coma (Rablo Games). You'll feed, train and play with the doggo. Going on walks and learning tricks is part of the fun too. There's no release window as yet for Golden Retriever Simple Life, which is coming to Steam. In the meantime, you can stay up to date on the game's progress with developer updates Good Boy Diaries from Pichu.I've seen Egging On pop up from time to time and I've been looking forward to checking it out. I won't have to wait much longer to do that as it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC (Xbox app and Steam) on November 6. It'll hit Game Pass on day one.In this precision platformer, you play as an egg (yes, a hen's egg) that tries to escape a farm. Fall too far and... well, you can probably guess what happens. Egobounds developed Egging On, and Alibi Games and IndieArk are the game's publishers. Anchor takes the format of games like Rust and Valheim and plunges you into the depths of the sea in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. The multiplayer survival game is slated to support more than 150 players per server and there are plans to expand that. You and your friends will take charge of genetically engineered beings and build a base that you have to defend from threats such as \"failed clone experiments\" and raids from other players. Things will change in this world even when you're not playing the game, so you'd better make sure your base is secure. Sharks are a major factor in Anchor as well. They aren't always necessarily hostile. But, as in real life, they're attracted to blood, so any damage you sustain could spell doom.Fearem is the developer of Anchor, which doesn't yet have a release window. It has set course for Steam.Hi everyone!Yes as ID@Xbox Showcase Fall 2025 announcement earlier, it's coming soon to Xbox PC and Xbox Series X|S too for launch day.We heard that there's no default subtitle loaded in the IGN Showcase, here's the one that do! also thankyou for your support @jokoanwar… pic.twitter.com/xFEuC5F0xA— Separuh Interactive | WISHLIST AGNI: VOC NOW! (@SeparuhGames) October 29, 2025 There's a lot going on in this trailer for Agni: Village of Calamity, which premiered during the ID@Xbox indie showcase this week. In this debut title from Separuh Interactive, you play as Agni, an investigator who undertakes an unauthorized investigation in a remote village. You'll need to solve puzzles and fend off monsters as you try to uncover the village's secrets and find your missing partner.Agni: Village of Calamity is steeped in Indonesian folklore. The one large monster that speaks in a childlike voice is quite unsettling. I'm intrigued to learn more about this survival horror game. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox PC and Steam in 2026.Let's wrap things up for this week with one more survival horror tale. There's often horror in beauty and vice versa (take a look at Silent Hill f, for instance). The Florist leans into both as well. As Jessica Park, you deliver a flower arrangement to a lakeside town. But an affliction takes over the area, causing the spread of flora that snares victims and turns them into monsters. For what it's worth, the teaser in that final shot of the trailer reminds me of a certain sequence from The Last of Us Part II. Unclear Games is taking an old-school approach here as it's using a fixed-camera design. You likely know the drill here: solving puzzles and defeating foes is your only way to stay alive. Finding out information about floral specimens will be helpful too. The Florist is coming to Steam in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-supernatural-detective-mystery-fmv-terror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000853.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $39 (14 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Anker MagGo power bank with kickstand (Qi2, 15W, 10K) for $57 (37 percent off): One of our favorite power banks, this brick from Anker gives you 10K capacity in a magnetic, relatively slim package. The built-in kickstand makes it easy to watch videos or make FaceTime calls while powering up, and the small display on the bank's edge will show you how much power is flowing to your phone. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Shark Steam and Scrub Steamer Mop for $110 (31 percent off): This is a slightly more affordable version of this Shark steamer I bought earlier this year and has become one of my favorite things. The one on sale has almost an identical design and arguably the most important feature: rotating dual pads on the bottom that actually lift up the dirt and stains on your floor without too much extra elbow grease needed on your part. It also has three different cleaning modes to choose from, depending on how stubborn the mess is that you're trying to clean up. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28. Which stores have Black Friday deals? Many physical retail stores have Black Friday deals including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and others. Even more retailers have online Black Friday deals, including Amazon, GameStop, Costco and others. When do Black Friday sales start?

Last year, we saw Black Friday deals online begin the week before Black Friday proper. When do Black Friday sales end? Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blended a lot over the past few years. Now, you can expect to see a good portion of Black Friday deals extend through the weekend and into Cyber Monday. It's not uncommon for Black Friday deals to expire at the end of Cyber Monday. Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals? The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It's also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you're looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you'll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers. Does Apple have Black Friday sales? No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple's website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday. Does Amazon have Black Friday sales? Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer's site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-2025-the-best-early-deals-on-apple-shark-lego-and-other-gear-plus-what-to-expect-during-the-sale-100052176.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $39 (14 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Anker MagGo power bank with kickstand (Qi2, 15W, 10K) for $57 (37 percent off): One of our favorite power banks, this brick from Anker gives you 10K capacity in a magnetic, relatively slim package. The built-in kickstand makes it easy to watch videos or make FaceTime calls while powering up, and the small display on the bank's edge will show you how much power is flowing to your phone. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Shark Steam and Scrub Steamer Mop for $110 (31 percent off): This is a slightly more affordable version of this Shark steamer I bought earlier this year and has become one of my favorite things. The one on sale has almost an identical design and arguably the most important feature: rotating dual pads on the bottom that actually lift up the dirt and stains on your floor without too much extra elbow grease needed on your part. It also has three different cleaning modes to choose from, depending on how stubborn the mess is that you're trying to clean up. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.

          "standfirst": "If you’re looking for a live TV streaming service, you probably want to watch live sports, catch local news or get access to your favorite linear channels — perhaps you want all three. Cable was once the only way to get all that content in one place, but for a decade or so now, live TV streaming services have provided an alternative that’s less confusing, easier to cancel and somewhat less expensive, though price hikes from every major streamer have brought the starting price to over $80 monthly for most plans.There are also plenty of free live TV streaming services from operators like Tubi, Pluto and Plex. And traditional streaming services like Peacock, Prime Video, Max, Apple TV+ and even Netflix are broadcasting live sporting events and shows. That's all to say that picking the best live TV streaming service may take some consideration. We tested every major option, spelling out the prices, pros, cons and features of each one to help you out.Editor's note: Each week brings new announcements in the live TV streaming world. YouTube TV resolved its dispute with NBC Universal only to get into another kerfuffle with Disney that caused ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and other networks to go dark on YouTube TV. For its part, Disney has completed combining the businesses of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV (which will continue to operate as separate entities for now) and CNN is again offering its own streaming service, called All Access, but it doesn’t include live CNN. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

Cable was once the only way to get all that content in one place, but for a decade or so now, live TV streaming services have provided an alternative that’s less confusing, easier to cancel and somewhat less expensive, though price hikes from every major streamer have brought the starting price to over $80 monthly for most plans.There are also plenty of free live TV streaming services from operators like Tubi, Pluto and Plex. And traditional streaming services like Peacock, Prime Video, Max, Apple TV+ and even Netflix are broadcasting live sporting events and shows. That's all to say that picking the best live TV streaming service may take some consideration. We tested every major option, spelling out the prices, pros, cons and features of each one to help you out.Editor's note: Each week brings new announcements in the live TV streaming world. YouTube TV resolved its dispute with NBC Universal only to get into another kerfuffle with Disney that caused ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and other networks to go dark on YouTube TV. For its part, Disney has completed combining the businesses of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV (which will continue to operate as separate entities for now) and CNN is again offering its own streaming service, called All Access, but it doesn’t include live CNN. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "standfirst": "Private Internet Access (PIA) comes with some of the best pricing of any VPN, and often doesn't feel like a budget service. I say \"often\" because, sadly, it does sometimes feel like you get what you pay for with PIA. While I'm working on seeing what settings iron out the kinks, the fact is that PIA doesn't always leave you with the internet speeds you need for everyday use. If you've found PIA unreliable, you may want to know how to end your subscription, get a refund and trade up to a more stable VPN service. Here, I'll explain how to stop your subscription from renewing, get your money back and delete your account (if you want to go that far). How to turn off auto-renewal for PIA Like with most VPNs, the standard way to cancel PIA is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of the current payment period. Whether you've signed up for one month, one year or three years, you'll get to keep using the VPN until that time expires. Here's the process to follow. In a desktop or mobile web browser, go to privateinternetaccess.com. Click Login at the top of the screen. Enter your account username and password. You'll be taken to your client control panel. It should automatically load on the Subscription Overview tab, but check the left-hand column to make sure. Under the username for the subscription you want to cancel, find the \"next billing\" heading, then click the Turn off auto-renewal link. You'll get a message trying to convince you not to cancel. Click Turn off auto-renewal again, this time at the bottom-left of the window. Give a cancellation reason. Feel free to click \"I have another reason,\" then enter one letter and click Continue with cancellation. Finally, the site will offer to connect you with tech support instead of cancelling. Hold the line and click Turn off auto-renewal once more. Sam Chapman for Engadget After fighting through all that, you should get confirmation that your account won't renew when the billing period expires. You've now got the rest of the term to look for a new VPN. Note that if you first download PIA from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, you may have purchased your subscription directly through the app. In this case, your subscription will be managed by the app store you bought it through, and you'll need to go there to cancel. Just open your profile, tab the subscriptions heading and scroll down to find PIA. How to delete your PIA account If you're certain that you're done with PIA, you may want to go the extra mile and delete your account altogether. You can do this by submitting a support ticket. Go to helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on Contact Us under the Resources heading (near the middle of the page). Sam Chapman for Engadget Write a clear, direct message. Feel free to use the above screenshot as an example. To get help faster, you can also use live chat — just go to the main PIA website, then click the button at the bottom-right that reads Need Help? Chat with us! This will get attention on your case right away, but you'll have to defeat an AI assistant first. How to get a refund from PIA PIA only gives refunds within the first 30 days after purchase. If you're within that window and want your money back, start by cancelling auto-renewal, then send a support ticket or contact live chat as described in the previous section. Say you are requesting a full refund under the money-back guarantee. Stick to your guns, as they'll probably try to convince you not to go. PIA alternatives If you still need a VPN after cancelling PIA — and you almost certainly do if you ever go online — Engadget has a list of the best VPNs to help you with comparison shopping. As a quick summary, Proton VPN is the all-around best service. ExpressVPN is pricey, but gives you great speeds and excellent app design. If you need consistently fast speeds every time, go with Surfshark.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-private-internet-access-and-get-a-refund-030034510.html?src=rss",

Armed with autonomous agents powered by Charlotte AI and NVIDIA Nemotron models, security teams aren&#x27;t just reacting; they&#x27;re striking back at attackers before their next move. Welcome to cybersecurity&#x27;s new arms race. Combining open source&#x27;s many strengths with agentic AI will shift the balance of power against adversarial AI. CrowdStrike and NVIDIA&#x27;s agentic ecosystem combines Charlotte AI AgentWorks, NVIDIA Nemotron open models, NVIDIA NeMo Data Designer synthetic data, NVIDIA Nemo Agent Toolkit, and NVIDIA NIM microservices. \"This collaboration redefines security operations by enabling analysts to build and deploy specialized AI agents at scale, leveraging trusted, enterprise-grade security with Nemotron models,\" writes Bryan Catanzaro, vice president, Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA. The partnership is designed to enable autonomous agents to learn quickly, reducing risks, threats, and false positives. Achieving that takes a heavy load off SOC leaders and their teams, who fight data fatigue nearly every day due to inaccurate data.The announcement at GTC Washington, D.C., signals the arrival of machine-speed defense that can finally match machine-speed attacks. Transforming elite analyst expertise into datasets at machine scaleThe partnership is differentiated by how the AI agents are designed to continually aggregate telemetry data, including insights from CrowdStrike Falcon Complete Managed Detection and Response analysts. \"What we&#x27;re able to do is take the intelligence, take the data, take the experience of our Falcon Complete analysts, and turn these experts into datasets. Turn the datasets into AI models, and then be able to create agents based on, really, the whole composition and experience that we&#x27;ve built up within the company so that our customers can benefit at scale from these agents always,\" said Daniel Bernard, CrowdStrike&#x27;s Chief Business Officer, during a recent briefing. Capitalizing on the strengths of the NVIDIA Nemotron open models, organizations will be able to have their autonomous agents continually learn by training on the datasets from Falcon Complete, the world&#x27;s largest MDR service handling millions of triage decisions monthly. CrowdStrike has previous experience in AI detection triage to the point of launching a service that scales this capability across its customer base. Charlotte AI Detection Triage, designed to integrate into existing security workflows and continuously adapt to evolving threats, automates alert assessment with over 98% accuracy and cuts manual triage by more than 40 hours per week.Elia Zaitsev, CrowdStrike&#x27;s chief technology officer, in explaining how Charlotte AI Detection Triage is able to deliver that level of performance, told VentureBeat: \"We wouldn&#x27;t have achieved this without the support of our Falcon Complete team. They perform triage within their workflow, manually addressing millions of detections. The high-quality, human-annotated dataset they provide is what enabled us to reach an accuracy of over 98%.\"Lessons learned with Charlotte AI Detection Triage directly apply to the NVIDIA partnership, further increasing the value it has the potential to deliver to SOCs who need help dealing with the deluge of alerts. Open source is table stakes for this partnership to work NVIDIA&#x27;s Nemotron open models address what many security leaders identify as the most critical barrier to AI adoption in regulated environments, which is the lack of clarity regarding how the model works, what its weights are, and how secure it is. Justin Boitano, Vice President, Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA, speaking for NVIDIA during a recent press briefing, explained: \"Open models are where people start in trying to build their own specialized domain knowledge. You want to own the IP ultimately. Not everybody wants to export their data, and then sort of import or pay for the intelligence that they consume. A lot of sovereign countries, many enterprises in regulated industries want to maintain all that data privacy and security.\" John Morello, CTO and co-founder of Gutsy (now Minimus), told VentureBeat that \"the open-source nature of Google&#x27;s BERT open-source language model allows Gutsy to customize and train their model for specific security use cases while maintaining privacy and efficiency.\" Morello emphasized that practitioners cite \"more transparency and better assurances of data privacy, along with great availability of expertise and more integration options across their architectures, as key reasons for going with open source.\"Keeping adversarial AI&#x27;s balance of power in check Cisco&#x27;s DJ Sampath, senior vice president of Cisco&#x27;s AI software and platform group, articulated the industry-wide imperative for open-source security models during a recent interview with VentureBeat: \"The reality is that attackers have access to open-source models too. The goal is to empower as many defenders as possible with robust models to strengthen security.\" Sampath explained that when Cisco released Foundation-Sec-8B, their open-source security model, at RSAC 2025, it was driven by a sense of responsibility: \"Funding for open-source projects has stalled, and there is a growing need for sustainable funding sources within the community. It is a corporate responsibility to provide these models while enabling communities to engage with AI from a defensive standpoint.\"The commitment to transparency extends to the most sensitive aspects of AI development. When concerns emerged about DeepSeek R1&#x27;s training data and potential compromise, NVIDIA responded decisively. As Boitano explained to VentureBeat, \"Government agencies were super concerned. They wanted the reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek, but they were a little concerned with, obviously, what might be trained into the DeepSeek model, which is what actually inspired us to completely open source everything in Nemotron models, including reasoning datasets.\"For practitioners managing open-source security at scale, this transparency is core to their companies. Itamar Sher, CEO of Seal Security, emphasized to VentureBeat that \"open-source models offer transparency,\" though he noted that \"managing their cycles and compliance remains a significant concern.\" Sher&#x27;s company uses generative AI to automate vulnerability remediation in open-source software, and as a recognized CVE Naming Authority (CNA), Seal can identify, document, and assign vulnerabilities, enhancing security across the ecosystem.A key partnership goal: bringing intelligence to the Edge\"Bringing the intelligence closer to where data is and decisions are made is just going to be a big advancement for security operations teams around the industry,\" Boitano emphasized. This edge deployment capability is especially critical for government agencies with fragmented and often legacy IT environments. VentureBeat asked Boitano how the initial discussions went with government agencies briefed on the partnership and its design goals before work began. \"The feeling across agencies that we&#x27;ve talked to is they always feel like, unfortunately, they&#x27;re behind the curve on these technology adoption,\" Boitano explained. \"The response was, anything you guys can do to help us secure the endpoints. It was a tedious and long process to get open models onto these, you know, higher side networks.\"NVIDIA and CrowdStrike have done the foundational work, including STIG hardening, FIPS encryption, air-gap compatibility, and removing the barriers that delayed open-model adoption on higher-side networks. The NVIDIA AI Factory for Government reference design provides comprehensive guidance for deploying AI agents in federal and high-assurance organizations while meeting the strictest security requirements.As Boitano explained, the urgency is existential: \"Having AI defense that&#x27;s running in your estate that can search for and detect these anomalies, and then alert and respond much faster, is just the natural consequence. It&#x27;s the only way to protect against the speed of AI at this point.\"",

The Walt Disney Co. has pulled its channels from YouTube TV as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement. That means that until that negotiation is resolved, you won't be able to watch any programming from those stations. That includes all upcoming college football and NFL games broadcast on ESPN's suite of channels —including Monday Night Football — as well as all ABC programming like Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and Dancing with the Stars. YouTube TV has stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. That's all fine and good, but if you're looking to watch one of those upcoming games, you're likely looking for a solution as soon as Friday night. The good news is that there are plenty of ways to get those channels back. If you want a permanent switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all of those channels. If you're looking for a workaround for this weekend (or for the long term) to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, here's are the best options so you won't miss a moment of sports, news, or entertainment, all pulled from our list of best live TV streaming services to cut cable. Grab an ESPN bundle so you won't miss a single game this weekend Get Hulu + Live TV at a great price Try Fubo free for a week and get $30 your first month Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month What about Sling \"day passes\"? You may have heard that Sling offers day, weekend and week passes to its streaming programming for as little as $5 per day. That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the Sling Orange tier), but ABC isn't included. You can get both with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.

Your station may have its own free local streaming news channel (many do), you can see if The Roku Channel carries your local station's news, or download your local news station app if it's a Nexstar channel. The other alternative — if you're within the broadcast radius of a local ABC affiliate — is to get an over-the-air antenna.

Despite being only weeks old, it already has a $50 discount on the base configuration, bringing it to $949. As for the other iPads, we're seeing a discount on the standard iPad with the A16 chip that drops it to $299. A handful of other Apple gear is on sale too, and we included those discounts below. There aren't nearly as many hot deals as there were for October Prime day — we're assuming most of the really steep discounts are being held in reserve for Black Friday — but until then, these are the best iPad deals we could find, along with other Apple discounts that are worth your time. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch) for $949 ($50 off): Apple's newest iPad came out earlier this month and is already seeing a $50 discount. That makes the model with 256GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity $949 instead $999. Both the silver and black colorway are currently discounted. We gave the new iPad Pro an 85 in our review and called it more powerful and capable than ever. It has an amazing screen and the build is stunning. It's powerful enough to do just about anything a laptop can, but it's almost impossibly thin and portable. That said, it's probably overkill for most people, and the cost is almost prohibitively high. This discount makes it a little easier to take. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off): This deal isn't an all-time low for the standard iPad model with 256GB of storage but it takes $50 off Apple's list price. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3, 1TB) for $949 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. This deal is only for the maxed-out model with 1TB of storage, but it ties the lowest price we've seen all the same. Best Apple deals Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Walmart. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the model with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit store shelves last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

          "title": "How an Oregon court became the stage for a $115,000 showdown between Meta and Facebook creators",
          "standfirst": "Some of the most successful creators on Facebook aren't names you'd ever recognize. In fact, many of their pages don't have a face or recognizable persona attached. Instead, they run pages dedicated to memes, animal videos and yes, AI-generated photos and videos.The people behind these pages are experts at creating content that can catch Facebook's algorithm and go viral. Successful pages can generate tens of thousands of dollars a month from performance bonuses, revenue-sharing and other monetization programs that pay Facebook creators for popular content.For years, Meta fostered this industry of viral content on Facebook. As the company transformed Facebook's main feed into a \"discovery engine\" of recommended posts from random pages and accounts, creators supplied a stream of content crafted for the algorithm. But over the last year, some creators say this dynamic has broken down. Meta has penalized creators for the very same content it once rewarded. Other creators have seen Facebook's payment systems break down due to glitches and other errors.One creator has become so frustrated, he's filed dozens of lawsuits in small claims court against Meta over the last year. Some of those lawsuits are related to missing payments and account issues he's experienced, but he's also brought 23 cases related to other creators' Facebook pages. As several of those cases are now winding their way through small claims court, he hopes his actions will bring attention to what he says is a wider breakdown in Meta's relationship with Facebook creators.The cases shine a light on how Meta's lack of human-centered customer service can impact creators who rely on the platform. But it also offers a glimpse into the volatile dynamics of viral Facebook content. Mel Bouzad is a former photojournalist for Getty Images who for the past eight years has made his living running popular Facebook pages with names like \"The Meme Bros\" and \"FunkiestShitEver.\" He posts memes, travel content and AI-generated videos. Over the years, he's become an expert at figuring out what type of content is most likely to rack up views and comments on Facebook. \"It's basically jumping on the trends as they're happening,\" he explains. \"If you can jump on the trending topics right at the beginning, then you get the momentum, it kicks in the algorithm, and it sends your content viral. And if one post goes viral, the algorithm is going to send the next post viral, because it thinks the next post is going to get the same type of engagement.\" He's also learned little tricks for drawing more Facebook comments: adding a small error in a travel-focused listicle, or asking questions like \"what's the most boring state in America?\"Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook.He estimates that at their peak, his pages collectively earned between $10,000 to $20,000 a month — primarily from performance bonuses and in-stream video ads — though they sometimes earned much more than that. Last September, 12 of his pages earned more than $68,0000 combined in performance bonuses, according to documents viewed by Engadget. But last year, five of his meme and travel pages were suddenly demonetized. The pages received a \"monetization policy violation,\" a vague, catch-all term that can describe many supposed infractions. After some digging, he discovered they had been flagged for allegedly operating in a country ineligible for Meta's monetization programs. \"To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available,\" a notice in the Facebook app said. \"You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Facebook changes product eligibility.\" Bouzad, who lives in the United States, assumed it was a misunderstanding and would be an easy fix.But, like so many others, he quickly found that getting help from Meta was far from straightforward. \"Despite 20+ support tickets and using paid support, I receive only automated replies,\" he later wrote in his first filing in small claims court last November. Bouzad had heard of people using small claims court to get Meta's attention and decided to try it for himself. \"I thought, I'm going to go in and sue for only one page … something small, just to get in the door [and] speak to somebody.\" At that point, Meta was withholding $2,498 in payments from the page called \"Man Cave USA,\" according to court documents. He requested Meta pay the outstanding balance, along with $409 to cover court fees and interest. His filing succeeded in getting a response from Meta. Bouzad said that about three weeks later he received a call from a law firm representing the social media company. After an extended back and forth, Meta eventually restored the page's ability to earn money. By February he officially dropped the case, telling the court that the company had \"corrected the issue and remitted the payments owed.\" Meta's conflicting explanationsWhile he was dealing with that case, he tried to resolve the issues related to his other pages. Since he was still in mediation with Meta for his \"Man Cave USA\" page, he asked Meta's representatives if they could help with his other pages. He says that during a mediation session over Zoom, Meta's legal reps told him they wouldn't help with other pages unless they were tied to a lawsuit. So in February he opened six new small claims court cases against the company. At the time, he said, Meta owed him more than $40,000 in unpaid invoices from accounts that had been wrongfully flagged; $15,000 of which were earnings from a single Facebook page. Because small claims court limits damages to $10,000 per case, he could only sue for a combined $35,000, but hoped that Meta would reinstate the payments if it were to re-examine his accounts.In the meantime, Bouzad continued to try to resolve his account issues through Meta's official support channels and received confusing, and sometimes downright conflicting, information. In one email, Meta support told him he had been flagged for \"limited originality of content,\" but didn't explain. He also, again, received notifications saying that he was in a country that was \"ineligible\" for Meta's monetization programs. In two separate chats with Meta Verified, the social network's paid subscription service for customer support, he was informed that he was ineligible because his page was linked to a bank account in Malta. The representatives then closed the chats without giving him an opportunity to respond, according to screenshots viewed by Engadget. Bouzad was getting more and more frustrated. \"One, I've never been to Malta, two, my bank is Wells Fargo and three, I live in Oregon,\" he says. A chat with Meta Verified support in which Bouzad was told his accounts were demonetized because his bank was based in Malta. Bouzad says he's only ever banked with Wells Fargo.He now sees his issues as part of a wider pattern from Meta. While the company had once provided him with a partner manager — a Facebook employee who could help sort out issues and provide advice — he hasn't had a dedicated contact at the company since 2020. To him, the problem is twofold: Meta has become overly reliant on artificial intelligence for content moderation, which results in too many errors. At the same time, he claims Meta has largely outsourced the customer service it does offer — like through Meta Verified — and these workers aren't able to handle the types of issues he and other creators increasingly encounter. Some creators who Bouzad has named in his lawsuits claim to have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in payments for what they describe as glitches in Meta's processes. Brent, a creator who asked to be identified by his first name only, was running a successful Facebook page that posts history-themed AI-generated videos. One recent clip features a group of supposed German prisoners-of-war walking through the snow, accompanied by a caption claiming that some POWs chose to immigrate to Canada following the war after experiencing \"humane treatment\" from their captors. The page was doing well for a few months until April, when Meta asked Brent to verify his identity in order to keep receiving payments. His account had more than $11,000 in unpaid earnings at the time, according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Several months later, Brent has been unable to complete this seemingly mundane step, despite repeatedly providing Meta a copy of his ID. Brent says that the issue stems from Meta mistakenly classifying his payout account as a \"private corporation\" rather than a \"personal account.\" He says he has spent thousands of dollars on Meta Verified (the highest tier costs $500 a month) and has opened numerous support cases but has not been able to get the issue resolved.Another creator is stuck after encountering a similar issue that prevented him from confirming the tax information associated with his payout account on Facebook. \"My payout earnings were locked due to non editable 'greyed out' details when it came to entering tax information and other fields,\" the creator explained. \"After about a year of trying to get support Meta finally came back with an archaic form to transfer the payout account to a new one associated with my page.\" But, after filling out the form for the transfer, Meta informed him that the more than $16,000 in unpaid earnings from his page were unable to be transferred to a new account. The creator, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a decade running music-related pages championing independent artists on the platform. \"We're collectively sick of how Meta treats everyone, failing to provide adequate support, reasoning, reports and outcomes for content creators,\" he told Engadget. \"There's little to no consistency or confidence in their ability to fairly reward creators.\" He's also battling stage 4 cancer, and says the missing funds have interfered with his treatment, and added to the stress he's already facing. His doctors recently informed him he likely has only a few months left to live; he's still hoping to recover the missing funds. Gaps in supportSocial media is filled with numerous complaints about the ineffectiveness of Facebook's support tools, including Meta Verified. Daniel Abas, the president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for creators, says that demonetization is a \"chronic issue\" affecting creators on many platforms, including Meta's. \"What's really difficult is not having consistency in terms of the enforcement and having policies that are opaque, having appeals processes that are inconsistent,\" he said.Abas says that creators, especially high-earning ones, should have more resources to get support from companies like Meta. \"Working with a web chat to get something resolved, or submitting an email to get something resolved, and not having that human touch is a major gap, and contributes to a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty when you're trying to build a company.\"Meta has seemingly been changing some of the standards it has for creators on Facebook over the last year. The company in recent months began to crack down on creators sharing spammy and \"low quality\" content, though it only described a few specific examples of such activity, like pages that share posts with \"long, distracting captions.\" The company does not prohibit creators from monetizing AI-generated content. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that Meta plans to add a \"huge corpus\" of AI content to its systems. Meta declined to provide a comment for this story. The company maintains Bouzad has violated its policies, and has argued his court cases involving other Facebook users should be dismissed. Bouzad insists that he has never intentionally violated Facebook's rules, and has grown frustrated with the company's changing explanations for why his pages have been demonetized. In an email with Meta Verified support, a customer service rep told him a recent violation for one of his travel pages was due to \"Limited Originality of Contents,\" but didn't point to a specific post. During mediation, though, Meta's legal team claimed the same page had been generating views via \"inauthentic engagement,\" according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Bouzad pushed back. \"This wasn’t manipulation — it was performance-based exposure … we’re being punished for the very behavior the system rewarded,\" he wrote in an email to Meta's legal team. Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views.In documents reviewed by Engadget, Meta doesn't explain its allegation of inauthentic engagement. But the company did tell Bouzad it would be willing to pay him $5,000 — a fraction of what he claims to be owed — to settle the cases even though it was standing by its decision to demonetize his pages. Bouzad declined. He believes that Meta is unfairly targeting him and other creators who run high-earning Facebook pages. Bouzad says he's heard countless stories from other creators who have also been hit with vague \"monetization page violations\" that have stalled their payments. Much like he experienced, these account flags don't describe the supposed infraction and don't give an opportunity for an appeal. This, he says, leaves creators with few options outside of the legal system.An unusual legal maneuver After filing his second batch of small claims court cases in February, he began to reach out to his network and started filing more cases. Bouzad is not a lawyer and has no legal training; he's relied on ChatGPT and Gemini to guide his legal strategy. Much of that strategy relies on showing that other creators have allowed him to sue on their behalf through a process known as an assignment of claims. He filed 25 such cases in 2025. Becoming a legal assignee is at best an unusual move for small claims court. Multiple legal experts contacted by Engadget said they had never heard of anyone doing so. \"Normally, I don't think you see assigned claims in small claims [court],\" Richard Slottee, a retired Oregon-based attorney, who has previously advised clients on small claims court cases. He said he was unsure of the legality of the move. Marion County Circuit Court Judge Lindsay Partridge, who is presiding over Bouzad's small claims court case, seems similarly perplexed by the issue. In an October 23 hearing, he said that \"there are some type of claims that under Oregon law, an anti-assignment clause would not be enforceable\" but that he was unsure if the statute would apply in this particular case. \"I tried to do a bunch of research on this,\" he said \"I just can't find an answer to it.\"Meta, on the other hand, has argued that its terms of service clearly prohibit users from transferring their rights to other parties without its consent. \"Based on the No Transfer Clause, this Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment,\" a Meta project manager wrote in a letter to the judge. During the hearing, Judge Partridge said he was \"concerned\" that \"what I have is essentially a very technical legal issue that's being presented by two non-attorneys.\" He said he would need \"a little bit more time\" to make a decision on whether Bouzad could move forward as an assignee.The group Bouzad is helping consists mainly of colleagues, friends and friends-of-friends who had heard about his small claims cases. And though a few of the individuals are people he's partnered with in the past, he says he has no financial stake in the success of their pages. \"It's power in numbers, we felt the more people, the more noise we could make, the better the chances of getting issues resolved,\" Bouzad says. \"They gave me their cases to try and get that help [to] force Facebook to fix their pages.\" But there's also a potentially lucrative payday for him if he succeeds. As an assignee, he has the sole right to collect any judgment that ultimately comes out of the other creator's claims. This Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment.A Meta project manager who is representing the company in small claims courtFor some of the creators involved, the amount at stake is far higher than what Bouzad has claimed in his flings. One UK-based creator who has assigned their claim to Bouzad runs a dog-themed Facebook page that generated more than $60,000 from in-stream video ads during a one-month period last year, according to documents seen by Engadget. Like Bouzad, their page was hit with an unexplained \"MPV\" violation that has affected their reach. \"Due to its original content and niche audience, the Facebook algorithm regularly rewards it with high reach and frequent placement in the recommendation feed,\" Bouzad wrote in a small claims court filing that claimed $1,000 in damages. \"This natural visibility has now been unfairly disabled by Meta.\" Another creator, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation from Meta, asked him to look into three of his Facebook pages, which collectively have more than 1.5 million followers. All three had been demonetized by Meta and, like Bouzad, the creator received conflicting explanations about why. He was told two of the pages were flagged for \"limited originality\" even though he told Engadget he only posts videos that are scripted and filmed by him and his business partners. His pages are dedicated to scripted sketches filmed to look like real-life encounters. They often show people in seemingly mundane situations becoming inexplicably angry, with descriptions like \"Teacher Karen Demands to Know Why I’m Picking Up My Kid,\" or \"I Gave Candy to Kids and Apparently That’s 'Wrong' Now.\"The third page was hit with a \"monetization page violation\" for residing in an \"ineligible country,\" despite the fact that, according to the creator, it was managed from the United States and the EU, both of which are eligible to participate in Meta's programs. Engadget has also verified the page manager locations using Facebook's page transparency information.Bouzad filed two small claims court cases related to these three pages. The two that had been flagged for limited originality eventually had their monetization restored and the case was dismissed. \"I think Mel's helping immensely,\" he told Engadget. \"The fact that he got us the two pages back helped us as a business a lot.\" The second case, related to the page with the \"MPV\" flag, is still pending. The creator, who has worked with Bouzad in the past, says he's grateful for the legal help, but increasingly frustrated with Meta. The demonetized page was his highest-earning page, making between $3,000 - $5,000 a month from video ads on Facebook, according to documents filed as part of the small claims lawsuit. He doesn't understand why Meta continues to penalize it when the page posts similar content as his other accounts. \"We've always been following the rules, because this is our business, it's how we pay the bills,\" he says. But, he says that Facebook's continued errors has made it \"extremely difficult\" to maintain a business as a creator. What's next Of the 32 cases Bouzad has filed, eight were resolved after Meta addressed the underlying issue. Nine cases were dismissed by Bouzad as the creators chose to pursue legal action in other states. Fifteen cases, including six related to Bouzad's own pages, are still open. In July, a judge consolidated Bouzad's remaining cases into a single claim, despite a motion from Bouzad to keep the cases separate. \"The cases affected by this order involve identical parties, raise substantially similar claims, and collectively seek damages that exceed the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court,\" a judge wrote. Bouzad is currently seeking more than $115,0000 in damages, $35,000 of which are from his own pages, over unpaid invoices, filing fees and other expenses related to his months-long battle over Facebook's monetization practices. According to Bouzad, the actual amount owed to him and the other creators is far higher. \"Actual unpaid earnings exceed $220,000,\" he wrote in a filing, \"but amounts have been capped in accordance with small claims jurisdictional limits.\" For now, Bouzad's claims can't move forward until the judge rules on whether Bouzad can proceed as an assignee. If the judge decides in his favor, he will be able to make his arguments to the circuit court judge overseeing the case. If the judge rules in Meta's favor, he will only be able to move forward with the claims pertaining to his own Facebook pages. Bouzad says he is prepared for the fight. He has painstakingly compiled more than 1,000 pages of court documents, screenshots and news clippings for his case. In his filing, he alleges Meta is in breach of contract over the missing payments. He says Meta has consistently flagged creators' accounts with vague \"MPV\" violations, made enforcement errors, delayed payments and ignored appeals. He acknowledges that his months-long legal battle, and his reduced earnings, have taken a toll on his personal life. \"Taking on Facebook, it's not like you're suing a mom and pop shop,\" he says. \"You're suing one of the largest businesses in the world, and it has caused a lot of stress.\"His goal is still to get the monetization restrictions lifted from the Facebook pages and for Meta to resume its payments to him and the other creators. \"I just want the pages fixed and the money paid that's owed,\" he said. He has hundreds of travel videos saved and ready to post on his Facebook pages if and when his monetization is restored.Have a tip for Karissa?

Mel Bouzad is a former photojournalist for Getty Images who for the past eight years has made his living running popular Facebook pages with names like \"The Meme Bros\" and \"FunkiestShitEver.\" He posts memes, travel content and AI-generated videos. Over the years, he's become an expert at figuring out what type of content is most likely to rack up views and comments on Facebook. \"It's basically jumping on the trends as they're happening,\" he explains. \"If you can jump on the trending topics right at the beginning, then you get the momentum, it kicks in the algorithm, and it sends your content viral. And if one post goes viral, the algorithm is going to send the next post viral, because it thinks the next post is going to get the same type of engagement.\" He's also learned little tricks for drawing more Facebook comments: adding a small error in a travel-focused listicle, or asking questions like \"what's the most boring state in America?\"Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook.He estimates that at their peak, his pages collectively earned between $10,000 to $20,000 a month — primarily from performance bonuses and in-stream video ads — though they sometimes earned much more than that. Last September, 12 of his pages earned more than $68,0000 combined in performance bonuses, according to documents viewed by Engadget. But last year, five of his meme and travel pages were suddenly demonetized. The pages received a \"monetization policy violation,\" a vague, catch-all term that can describe many supposed infractions. After some digging, he discovered they had been flagged for allegedly operating in a country ineligible for Meta's monetization programs. \"To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available,\" a notice in the Facebook app said. \"You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Facebook changes product eligibility.\" Bouzad, who lives in the United States, assumed it was a misunderstanding and would be an easy fix.But, like so many others, he quickly found that getting help from Meta was far from straightforward. \"Despite 20+ support tickets and using paid support, I receive only automated replies,\" he later wrote in his first filing in small claims court last November. Bouzad had heard of people using small claims court to get Meta's attention and decided to try it for himself. \"I thought, I'm going to go in and sue for only one page … something small, just to get in the door [and] speak to somebody.\" At that point, Meta was withholding $2,498 in payments from the page called \"Man Cave USA,\" according to court documents. He requested Meta pay the outstanding balance, along with $409 to cover court fees and interest. His filing succeeded in getting a response from Meta. Bouzad said that about three weeks later he received a call from a law firm representing the social media company. After an extended back and forth, Meta eventually restored the page's ability to earn money. By February he officially dropped the case, telling the court that the company had \"corrected the issue and remitted the payments owed.\" Meta's conflicting explanationsWhile he was dealing with that case, he tried to resolve the issues related to his other pages. Since he was still in mediation with Meta for his \"Man Cave USA\" page, he asked Meta's representatives if they could help with his other pages. He says that during a mediation session over Zoom, Meta's legal reps told him they wouldn't help with other pages unless they were tied to a lawsuit. So in February he opened six new small claims court cases against the company. At the time, he said, Meta owed him more than $40,000 in unpaid invoices from accounts that had been wrongfully flagged; $15,000 of which were earnings from a single Facebook page. Because small claims court limits damages to $10,000 per case, he could only sue for a combined $35,000, but hoped that Meta would reinstate the payments if it were to re-examine his accounts.In the meantime, Bouzad continued to try to resolve his account issues through Meta's official support channels and received confusing, and sometimes downright conflicting, information. In one email, Meta support told him he had been flagged for \"limited originality of content,\" but didn't explain. He also, again, received notifications saying that he was in a country that was \"ineligible\" for Meta's monetization programs. In two separate chats with Meta Verified, the social network's paid subscription service for customer support, he was informed that he was ineligible because his page was linked to a bank account in Malta. The representatives then closed the chats without giving him an opportunity to respond, according to screenshots viewed by Engadget. Bouzad was getting more and more frustrated. \"One, I've never been to Malta, two, my bank is Wells Fargo and three, I live in Oregon,\" he says. A chat with Meta Verified support in which Bouzad was told his accounts were demonetized because his bank was based in Malta. Bouzad says he's only ever banked with Wells Fargo.He now sees his issues as part of a wider pattern from Meta. While the company had once provided him with a partner manager — a Facebook employee who could help sort out issues and provide advice — he hasn't had a dedicated contact at the company since 2020. To him, the problem is twofold: Meta has become overly reliant on artificial intelligence for content moderation, which results in too many errors. At the same time, he claims Meta has largely outsourced the customer service it does offer — like through Meta Verified — and these workers aren't able to handle the types of issues he and other creators increasingly encounter. Some creators who Bouzad has named in his lawsuits claim to have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in payments for what they describe as glitches in Meta's processes. Brent, a creator who asked to be identified by his first name only, was running a successful Facebook page that posts history-themed AI-generated videos. One recent clip features a group of supposed German prisoners-of-war walking through the snow, accompanied by a caption claiming that some POWs chose to immigrate to Canada following the war after experiencing \"humane treatment\" from their captors. The page was doing well for a few months until April, when Meta asked Brent to verify his identity in order to keep receiving payments. His account had more than $11,000 in unpaid earnings at the time, according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Several months later, Brent has been unable to complete this seemingly mundane step, despite repeatedly providing Meta a copy of his ID. Brent says that the issue stems from Meta mistakenly classifying his payout account as a \"private corporation\" rather than a \"personal account.\" He says he has spent thousands of dollars on Meta Verified (the highest tier costs $500 a month) and has opened numerous support cases but has not been able to get the issue resolved.Another creator is stuck after encountering a similar issue that prevented him from confirming the tax information associated with his payout account on Facebook. \"My payout earnings were locked due to non editable 'greyed out' details when it came to entering tax information and other fields,\" the creator explained. \"After about a year of trying to get support Meta finally came back with an archaic form to transfer the payout account to a new one associated with my page.\" But, after filling out the form for the transfer, Meta informed him that the more than $16,000 in unpaid earnings from his page were unable to be transferred to a new account. The creator, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a decade running music-related pages championing independent artists on the platform. \"We're collectively sick of how Meta treats everyone, failing to provide adequate support, reasoning, reports and outcomes for content creators,\" he told Engadget. \"There's little to no consistency or confidence in their ability to fairly reward creators.\" He's also battling stage 4 cancer, and says the missing funds have interfered with his treatment, and added to the stress he's already facing. His doctors recently informed him he likely has only a few months left to live; he's still hoping to recover the missing funds. Gaps in supportSocial media is filled with numerous complaints about the ineffectiveness of Facebook's support tools, including Meta Verified. Daniel Abas, the president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for creators, says that demonetization is a \"chronic issue\" affecting creators on many platforms, including Meta's. \"What's really difficult is not having consistency in terms of the enforcement and having policies that are opaque, having appeals processes that are inconsistent,\" he said.Abas says that creators, especially high-earning ones, should have more resources to get support from companies like Meta. \"Working with a web chat to get something resolved, or submitting an email to get something resolved, and not having that human touch is a major gap, and contributes to a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty when you're trying to build a company.\"Meta has seemingly been changing some of the standards it has for creators on Facebook over the last year. The company in recent months began to crack down on creators sharing spammy and \"low quality\" content, though it only described a few specific examples of such activity, like pages that share posts with \"long, distracting captions.\" The company does not prohibit creators from monetizing AI-generated content. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that Meta plans to add a \"huge corpus\" of AI content to its systems. Meta declined to provide a comment for this story. The company maintains Bouzad has violated its policies, and has argued his court cases involving other Facebook users should be dismissed. Bouzad insists that he has never intentionally violated Facebook's rules, and has grown frustrated with the company's changing explanations for why his pages have been demonetized. In an email with Meta Verified support, a customer service rep told him a recent violation for one of his travel pages was due to \"Limited Originality of Contents,\" but didn't point to a specific post. During mediation, though, Meta's legal team claimed the same page had been generating views via \"inauthentic engagement,\" according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Bouzad pushed back. \"This wasn’t manipulation — it was performance-based exposure … we’re being punished for the very behavior the system rewarded,\" he wrote in an email to Meta's legal team. Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views.In documents reviewed by Engadget, Meta doesn't explain its allegation of inauthentic engagement. But the company did tell Bouzad it would be willing to pay him $5,000 — a fraction of what he claims to be owed — to settle the cases even though it was standing by its decision to demonetize his pages. Bouzad declined. He believes that Meta is unfairly targeting him and other creators who run high-earning Facebook pages. Bouzad says he's heard countless stories from other creators who have also been hit with vague \"monetization page violations\" that have stalled their payments. Much like he experienced, these account flags don't describe the supposed infraction and don't give an opportunity for an appeal. This, he says, leaves creators with few options outside of the legal system.An unusual legal maneuver After filing his second batch of small claims court cases in February, he began to reach out to his network and started filing more cases. Bouzad is not a lawyer and has no legal training; he's relied on ChatGPT and Gemini to guide his legal strategy. Much of that strategy relies on showing that other creators have allowed him to sue on their behalf through a process known as an assignment of claims. He filed 25 such cases in 2025. Becoming a legal assignee is at best an unusual move for small claims court. Multiple legal experts contacted by Engadget said they had never heard of anyone doing so. \"Normally, I don't think you see assigned claims in small claims [court],\" Richard Slottee, a retired Oregon-based attorney, who has previously advised clients on small claims court cases. He said he was unsure of the legality of the move. Marion County Circuit Court Judge Lindsay Partridge, who is presiding over Bouzad's small claims court case, seems similarly perplexed by the issue. In an October 23 hearing, he said that \"there are some type of claims that under Oregon law, an anti-assignment clause would not be enforceable\" but that he was unsure if the statute would apply in this particular case. \"I tried to do a bunch of research on this,\" he said \"I just can't find an answer to it.\"Meta, on the other hand, has argued that its terms of service clearly prohibit users from transferring their rights to other parties without its consent. \"Based on the No Transfer Clause, this Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment,\" a Meta project manager wrote in a letter to the judge. During the hearing, Judge Partridge said he was \"concerned\" that \"what I have is essentially a very technical legal issue that's being presented by two non-attorneys.\" He said he would need \"a little bit more time\" to make a decision on whether Bouzad could move forward as an assignee.The group Bouzad is helping consists mainly of colleagues, friends and friends-of-friends who had heard about his small claims cases. And though a few of the individuals are people he's partnered with in the past, he says he has no financial stake in the success of their pages. \"It's power in numbers, we felt the more people, the more noise we could make, the better the chances of getting issues resolved,\" Bouzad says. \"They gave me their cases to try and get that help [to] force Facebook to fix their pages.\" But there's also a potentially lucrative payday for him if he succeeds. As an assignee, he has the sole right to collect any judgment that ultimately comes out of the other creator's claims. This Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment.A Meta project manager who is representing the company in small claims courtFor some of the creators involved, the amount at stake is far higher than what Bouzad has claimed in his flings. One UK-based creator who has assigned their claim to Bouzad runs a dog-themed Facebook page that generated more than $60,000 from in-stream video ads during a one-month period last year, according to documents seen by Engadget. Like Bouzad, their page was hit with an unexplained \"MPV\" violation that has affected their reach. \"Due to its original content and niche audience, the Facebook algorithm regularly rewards it with high reach and frequent placement in the recommendation feed,\" Bouzad wrote in a small claims court filing that claimed $1,000 in damages. \"This natural visibility has now been unfairly disabled by Meta.\" Another creator, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation from Meta, asked him to look into three of his Facebook pages, which collectively have more than 1.5 million followers. All three had been demonetized by Meta and, like Bouzad, the creator received conflicting explanations about why. He was told two of the pages were flagged for \"limited originality\" even though he told Engadget he only posts videos that are scripted and filmed by him and his business partners. His pages are dedicated to scripted sketches filmed to look like real-life encounters. They often show people in seemingly mundane situations becoming inexplicably angry, with descriptions like \"Teacher Karen Demands to Know Why I’m Picking Up My Kid,\" or \"I Gave Candy to Kids and Apparently That’s 'Wrong' Now.\"The third page was hit with a \"monetization page violation\" for residing in an \"ineligible country,\" despite the fact that, according to the creator, it was managed from the United States and the EU, both of which are eligible to participate in Meta's programs. Engadget has also verified the page manager locations using Facebook's page transparency information.Bouzad filed two small claims court cases related to these three pages. The two that had been flagged for limited originality eventually had their monetization restored and the case was dismissed. \"I think Mel's helping immensely,\" he told Engadget. \"The fact that he got us the two pages back helped us as a business a lot.\" The second case, related to the page with the \"MPV\" flag, is still pending. The creator, who has worked with Bouzad in the past, says he's grateful for the legal help, but increasingly frustrated with Meta. The demonetized page was his highest-earning page, making between $3,000 - $5,000 a month from video ads on Facebook, according to documents filed as part of the small claims lawsuit. He doesn't understand why Meta continues to penalize it when the page posts similar content as his other accounts. \"We've always been following the rules, because this is our business, it's how we pay the bills,\" he says. But, he says that Facebook's continued errors has made it \"extremely difficult\" to maintain a business as a creator. What's next Of the 32 cases Bouzad has filed, eight were resolved after Meta addressed the underlying issue. Nine cases were dismissed by Bouzad as the creators chose to pursue legal action in other states. Fifteen cases, including six related to Bouzad's own pages, are still open. In July, a judge consolidated Bouzad's remaining cases into a single claim, despite a motion from Bouzad to keep the cases separate. \"The cases affected by this order involve identical parties, raise substantially similar claims, and collectively seek damages that exceed the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court,\" a judge wrote. Bouzad is currently seeking more than $115,0000 in damages, $35,000 of which are from his own pages, over unpaid invoices, filing fees and other expenses related to his months-long battle over Facebook's monetization practices. According to Bouzad, the actual amount owed to him and the other creators is far higher. \"Actual unpaid earnings exceed $220,000,\" he wrote in a filing, \"but amounts have been capped in accordance with small claims jurisdictional limits.\" For now, Bouzad's claims can't move forward until the judge rules on whether Bouzad can proceed as an assignee. If the judge decides in his favor, he will be able to make his arguments to the circuit court judge overseeing the case. If the judge rules in Meta's favor, he will only be able to move forward with the claims pertaining to his own Facebook pages. Bouzad says he is prepared for the fight. He has painstakingly compiled more than 1,000 pages of court documents, screenshots and news clippings for his case. In his filing, he alleges Meta is in breach of contract over the missing payments. He says Meta has consistently flagged creators' accounts with vague \"MPV\" violations, made enforcement errors, delayed payments and ignored appeals. He acknowledges that his months-long legal battle, and his reduced earnings, have taken a toll on his personal life. \"Taking on Facebook, it's not like you're suing a mom and pop shop,\" he says. \"You're suing one of the largest businesses in the world, and it has caused a lot of stress.\"His goal is still to get the monetization restrictions lifted from the Facebook pages and for Meta to resume its payments to him and the other creators. \"I just want the pages fixed and the money paid that's owed,\" he said. He has hundreds of travel videos saved and ready to post on his Facebook pages if and when his monetization is restored.Have a tip for Karissa?

Amazon recently revealed a newer version of the Blink Mini that records 2K footage, but the 1080p Blink Mini 2 can still get the job done. The Blink Mini 2 is our pick for the best budget security camera. It's easy to set up and it integrates neatly into the Alexa smart home ecosystem. While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures. The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you'll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell. A number of other Blink cameras and bundles are on sale at the moment. If you like the idea of the Mini 2 but want to use it outdoors, you can get two cameras with two weather-resistant adapters for only $48. Elsewhere, the latest Blink Video Doorbell is 50 percent off and down to $30 and Blink Outdoor 4 camera systems are 60 percent off, so you can grab one starting at just $32.

Monarch Money is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50. As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.

          "title": "The best free VPNs in 2025",
          "standfirst": "A good VPN is worth paying for. Almost every service I'll recommend as one of the best VPNs is either subscription-only or supported by paid plans. Free VPNs do have their place, though, as not everybody can afford yet another subscription in the software-as-a-service hellscape we live in. Since everyone deserves privacy and flexibility online, I wanted to put together a definitive list of the best free VPNs.Now, some will say that free VPNs are, by definition, security risks that are to be avoided by default. That reputation exists because free VPNs often really are a risk. As proliferating age verification laws have created a need for VPNs, some free services have stepped up to answer the call, while others have taken advantage of it to spread malware. Free VPNs are easy for scammers to set up and hard for app stores to catch. I never recommend using one without doing thorough research.To that end, the three providers on this list are exceptions to the risk of free VPNs. While they all have tradeoffs, they're also upfront about what they do and don't do. Each one comes with reliable security, a clean record of handling user data and apps that never force you to upgrade just so they'll work properly. They aren't the only good free VPNs, but they're the top three by far.Editor's note: This list represents our ranking as of October 2025. We intend to revisit the list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in features, testing results and other factors. Best free VPNs for 2025 Other free VPNs we tested The first three no-cost VPNs mentioned here are worthy of recommendation in their own ways, but didn't quite make the cut for our top picks. I've left notes on them here in case one of them turns out to be perfect for you, and because they're on my list for induction into the free VPN pantheon if they improve. None of the above applies to Hotspot Shield, which you should not use. It's on here as a warning. You can find more details in that section below. PrivadoVPN PrivadoVPN is a strong enough contender that I seriously considered adding it to the list as my fourth official recommendation. It's technically unlimited, though once you use 10GB of data, it sharply handicaps your speed for the rest of the month. Free users can choose between 13 server locations on four continents. It even performs well on worldwide latency tests, though download speeds swing pretty heavily. That uncertain speed stat kept Privado out of the winner's circle, as did one other concern: although it has a clear and extensive privacy policy, it's never gone through a third-party audit. Additionally, it's a newer service, having only launched in 2019 — so it's harder to make claims about its business practices. Finally, while hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN all retain their excellence on the paid plan, PrivadoVPN isn't as worth paying for. Outside the free plan, it's a decent VPN with no reason to pick it over Proton or ExpressVPN. That said, if it passes an audit — or faces a real-world test of its no-logs policy, like a server seizure — look for Privado to join the big leagues soon. TunnelBear TunnelBear does free VPN service well — it just doesn't do enough. Trust me, I don’t take pleasure in criticizing its adorable, hole-digging bear mascot, which goes a long way toward making the app welcoming to beginners. I like that its free plan offers access to the entire server network, the only VPN that does so. But the hard fact is that 2GB of data per month is not enough to do much of anything. With such a low data limit, TunnelBear's free plan is an enticement to upgrade to its paid service, not a viable VPN solution in its own right. That really is a good bear, though. EventVPN EventVPN, developed by the ExpressVPN team, was launched a month ago and could one day become an outstanding free VPN. However, given its bizarre decision to run ads in the app, I can't endorse it right now. Were EventVPN not associated with ExpressVPN or Kape Technologies, I might defend its decision to show ads by pointing out that all ad tracking data is anonymized — there isn't even a backend in which to store it. That might be a decent way to fund a full-featured free VPN. But EventVPN is openly part of a lucrative VPN portfolio, and has its own paid tier, so there's no excuse for the 30-second video ads. Hotspot Shield: Tested and not recommended Hotspot Shield was once the poster child for free VPNs; today, it's become one of the clearest illustrations of why they're dangerous. You get 500MB of browsing data per day, which is reasonable, on par with Windscribe's best offer. However, not only does the free version cap speeds at 2 Mbps, but it also restricts you to one location, the United States. Worse, it shows you ads. Unlike EventVPN, which at least limits itself to ads from a single service, Hotspot Shield lists no fewer than eight ad coordinators in its privacy policy. One of them is Meta, which you should never, ever trust with any sensitive data. I can't name a better textbook example of \"if the product is free, you're the product.\" What to look for in a free VPN Selecting a VPN is hard enough with all the competition out there, but with a free VPN, the stakes are even higher. Free VPNs are all over the place, and app stores don't vet them effectively. You're left on your own to determine whether a free VPN is mediocre, exploitative or even a straight-up malware vector. My top three recommendations — hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN — are clean. If you choose to use another one, here are the red flags to consider. Security: First, make absolutely certain the free VPN isn't a threat to your security. Research it to see if any experts have warned against it, and check to make sure it uses known and approved encryption protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2 or an equivalent). If you have an antivirus program, download the VPN in sandbox mode so you can scan it while it's quarantined. Privacy: Read the free VPN's privacy policy in detail to see if it claims any liberties with your personal data. As a rule, never use an \"ad-supported\" free VPN, since almost all ad services track users for targeted campaigns. Other free services, like Hola VPN, make money by selling user IP addresses as residential proxies. Be alert for any indication that the VPN will profit off your personal data. Usage requirements: If you've determined a free VPN is safe and secure, your next step is to make sure you'll be able to use it for the tasks you have in mind. Most reputable free VPNs are limited in some way. Match the restrictions to what you need; for example, if you want a free VPN for streaming, pick one without data caps that lets you choose your own server location. Speed: Even if it meets the minimum requirements of safety and privacy, a free VPN still needs to meet the same criteria as any paid service. Mainly, it's got to be fast. With the free VPN active, run speed tests using Ookla in several locations. On average, it shouldn't reduce your unprotected download speed by more than 25 percent. Customer service: Some otherwise full-featured free VPNs skimp on customer service, restricting live help to paid users. Even Proton VPN is guilty of this. If you're a beginner or think you're going to need extra help, make sure to pick a free VPN with a well-written knowledgebase and available tech support. Free VPN FAQs Let's finish up with some of the free VPN questions we get most often. Leave a comment if you'd like me to answer one I haven't gotten to yet. What is a free VPN? A free VPN is a virtual private network that's available to individual users at no cost. They generally take the form of desktop and mobile apps downloaded through websites or app stores. You can use them to filter your internet connection through another server, changing your virtual location and hiding what you do online. Most people use free VPNs to make it appear that they're getting online from somewhere else. This gets around restrictions on internet usage in certain jurisdictions, like China's \"Great Firewall\" or the UK's age verification laws. It can also be used to stream TV shows and events that aren't available in the user's home region. Are free VPNs safe? While free VPNs aren't inherently dangerous, the use case and underlying business model makes them an easy vector for unscrupulous companies to take advantage of vulnerable users. It's easy for a malicious actor to set one up quickly and get it hosted on an app store. Likewise, the people who download free VPNs tend to need them urgently and may not look too closely at what they're putting on their phones or computers. As a rule of thumb, you should approach a free VPN with extreme caution. If it's not on our recommended list above, we'd suggest avoiding it. In general, it's almost always safer to seek out VPNs that support their free versions with paid subscriptions, since they don't need to make money under the table. But any VPN – or other digital service – that's put forward as totally free puts us in mind of the old adage about gambling: If you can't spot the sucker at the table, it's probably you. What is the best free VPN? I've rated hide.me as the best free VPN. Its free service gives you a lot to work with — seven free locations and a data cap that doesn't really apply in practice. It's also just as secure and trustworthy as its paid version, without skimping on anything important. Can you get a free VPN on your phone? Yes — in fact, there are more free VPNs on mobile app stores than almost anywhere else. All three of my top picks (hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN) have apps for both iOS and Android, and nearly every other free VPN works on at least one mobile platform.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html?src=rss",

YouTube TV lost access to Disney channels back in 2021, but they were immediately able to strike a deal that restored the channels the very next day. The companies are most likely still trying to negotiate at the moment, but Google says it will offer subscribers a $20 credit if Disney channels remain offline for an extended period of time. Google has had to make several similar announcements over the past year. In February, YouTube TV almost lost Paramount content, including CBS, CBS Sports and Nickelodeon, before reaching a last-minute deal. The same thing happened in August with Fox. More recently, Google and NBCUniversal also came to an agreement at the eleventh hour, though YouTube TV lost access to Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html?src=rss",

The companies are most likely still trying to negotiate at the moment, but Google says it will offer subscribers a $20 credit if Disney channels remain offline for an extended period of time. Google has had to make several similar announcements over the past year. In February, YouTube TV almost lost Paramount content, including CBS, CBS Sports and Nickelodeon, before reaching a last-minute deal. The same thing happened in August with Fox. More recently, Google and NBCUniversal also came to an agreement at the eleventh hour, though YouTube TV lost access to Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels-113026329.html?src=rss",

Combine that with lighter designs and quieter cooling, and it’s easy to see why a projector can replace or complement a traditional TV.We’ve tested projectors across categories and price ranges to help you find the right one, whether you’re aiming for a portable option to take on the go or a cinematic display that turns any wall into a screen. Table of contents Best projectors for 2025 What to look for in a projector Best projector FAQs Best projectors for 2025 Some projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one. What to look for in a projector For a deep dive on projector technology check my previous explainer, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean. Brightness and contrast Brightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections. DLP vs LCD Digital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time. Resolution If you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use 2K projectors for various reasons). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution. Elite Starling HDR and color accuracy Projectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called tone mapping to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors. UST vs. classic Classic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens. Mounting and fan noise Ceiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others. Optics For more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a \"keystone correction\" to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models. Gaming and streaming If you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and <20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle. Screens Should you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light. Best projector FAQs Are 4K projectors better? Yes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important. Is a projector better than a TV? Projectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use. Is 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector? Yes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day. Should I get a 4K or 1080p projector? That depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford. What are the best projectors in daylight? The best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000. Do you need a screen for a better projector experience? Technically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater. Should I buy a portable or home projector? It depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Inside Celosphere 2025: Why there’s no ‘enterprise AI’ without process intelligence",
          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisAI adoption is accelerating, but results often lag expectations. And enterprise leaders are under pressure to prove measurable ROI from the AI solutions — especially as the use of autonomous agents rises and global tariffs disrupt supply chains.The issue isn’t the AI itself, says Alex Rinke, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, a global leader in process intelligence. “To succeed, enterprise AI needs to understand the context of a business’s processes — and how to improve them,” he explains. Without this business context, AI risks becoming, as Rinke puts it, “just an internal social experiment.”Next week’s Celosphere 2025 will tackle the AI ROI challenge head-on. The three-day event brings together customer strategies, hands-on workshops, and live demonstrations, highlighting enhancements to the Celonis Process Intelligence (PI) Platform that help enterprises harness ‘enterprise AI,’ powered by PI, to continuously improve operations, creating measurable business value at scale.Focus on measurable ROIThe event’s focus on achieving AI ROI reflects three challenges facing technology and business leaders moving from pilot to production: obsolete systems, break-neck industry change, and agentic AI. According to Gartner, 64% of board members now view AI as a top-three priority — yet only 10% of organizations report meaningful financial returns.Celonis customers are bucking that trend. A Forrester Total Economic Impact study found organizations using its platform achieved 383% ROI over three years, with payback in just six months. One company improved sales order automation from 33% to 86%, saving $24.5 million. The study estimated $44.1 million in total benefits over three years, driven by faster automation, reduced inefficiencies, and higher process visibility. These numbers underscore a broader pattern — companies that modernize outdated systems and align AI with process optimization see faster payback and sustained gains.Real companies, real resultsCelosphere will spotlight how global enterprises are building “future-fit” operations. Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Vinmar Group will showcase AI-driven, composable solutions, powered by PI, and attendees will see demonstrations of PI enabling agents in live production environments.Among the notable success stories: AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company, reduced excess inventory while keeping critical medicines flowing by using Celonis as a foundation for its OpenAI partnership.The State of Oklahoma can answer procurement status questions at scale, unlocking over $10 million in value. Cosentino clears blocked sales orders up to 5x faster using an AI-powered credit management assistant. Raising the stakes for agentic AINumerous sessions will focus on orchestrating AI agents. The shift from AI-as-advisor to AI-as-actor, changes everything, says Rinke. “The agent needs to understand not just what to do, but how your specific business actually works,” he explains. “Process intelligence provides those rails.\" This leap from recommendation to autonomous action raises the stakes exponentially. When agents can independently trigger purchase orders, reroute shipments, or approve exceptions, bad context can mean catastrophically bad outcomes at scale.Celosphere attendees will get to see first-hand how companies are using the Celonis Orchestration Engine to coordinate AI agents alongside people and systems. Effective orchestration is a crucial protection against the chaos of agents working at cross-purposes, duplicating actions, or letting crucial steps fall through the cracks. Navigating tariffs and supply chain shocksGlobal trade volatility isn&#x27;t just a headline — it&#x27;s an operational nightmare reshaping how companies deploy AI, Rinke says. New tariffs trigger cascading effects across procurement, logistics, and compliance. Each policy shift can cascade across thousands of SKUs — forcing new supplier contracts, rerouted shipments, and rebalanced inventories. For AI systems trained on static conditions, that volatility is almost impossible to predict. Traditional AI systems struggle with such variability — but process intelligence gives organizations real-time visibility into how changes ripple through operations.Celosphere case studies will show how companies turn disruption into advantage. Smurfit Westrock uses PI to optimize inventory and reduce costs amid tariff uncertainty, while ASOS leverages PI to optimize its supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and continuing to deliver an outstanding customer experience.Platform over point solutionsRinke argues that Celonis’ edge lies in treating process intelligence not as an add-on, but as the foundation of the enterprise stack. Unlike bolt-on optimization tools, the Celonis platform creates a living digital twin of business operations — a continuously updated model enriched by context that lets AI operate effectively from analysis to execution.“What sets Celonis apart is visibility across systems and offline tasks, which is critical for true intelligent automation,” Rinke says. “The platform offers comprehensive capabilities spanning process analysis, design, and orchestration rather than a point solution.”“Free the Process” and the future of AICelonis continues to champion openness through its “Free the Process” movement, promoting fair competition and freeing enterprises from legacy lock-in. By giving organizations full access to their own process data, open APIs, and a growing partner network that includes The Hackett Group, ClearOps, and Lobster, Celonis is building the connective tissue for a new era of interoperable automation.For Rinke, this open foundation is what turns AI from a set of experiments into an enterprise engine. “Process intelligence creates a flywheel,” he says. “Better understanding leads to better optimization, which enables better AI — and that, in turn, drives even greater understanding. There is no AI without PI.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

And enterprise leaders are under pressure to prove measurable ROI from the AI solutions — especially as the use of autonomous agents rises and global tariffs disrupt supply chains.The issue isn’t the AI itself, says Alex Rinke, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, a global leader in process intelligence. “To succeed, enterprise AI needs to understand the context of a business’s processes — and how to improve them,” he explains. Without this business context, AI risks becoming, as Rinke puts it, “just an internal social experiment.”Next week’s Celosphere 2025 will tackle the AI ROI challenge head-on. The three-day event brings together customer strategies, hands-on workshops, and live demonstrations, highlighting enhancements to the Celonis Process Intelligence (PI) Platform that help enterprises harness ‘enterprise AI,’ powered by PI, to continuously improve operations, creating measurable business value at scale.Focus on measurable ROIThe event’s focus on achieving AI ROI reflects three challenges facing technology and business leaders moving from pilot to production: obsolete systems, break-neck industry change, and agentic AI. According to Gartner, 64% of board members now view AI as a top-three priority — yet only 10% of organizations report meaningful financial returns.Celonis customers are bucking that trend. A Forrester Total Economic Impact study found organizations using its platform achieved 383% ROI over three years, with payback in just six months. One company improved sales order automation from 33% to 86%, saving $24.5 million. The study estimated $44.1 million in total benefits over three years, driven by faster automation, reduced inefficiencies, and higher process visibility. These numbers underscore a broader pattern — companies that modernize outdated systems and align AI with process optimization see faster payback and sustained gains.Real companies, real resultsCelosphere will spotlight how global enterprises are building “future-fit” operations. Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Vinmar Group will showcase AI-driven, composable solutions, powered by PI, and attendees will see demonstrations of PI enabling agents in live production environments.Among the notable success stories: AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company, reduced excess inventory while keeping critical medicines flowing by using Celonis as a foundation for its OpenAI partnership.The State of Oklahoma can answer procurement status questions at scale, unlocking over $10 million in value. Cosentino clears blocked sales orders up to 5x faster using an AI-powered credit management assistant. Raising the stakes for agentic AINumerous sessions will focus on orchestrating AI agents. The shift from AI-as-advisor to AI-as-actor, changes everything, says Rinke. “The agent needs to understand not just what to do, but how your specific business actually works,” he explains. “Process intelligence provides those rails.\" This leap from recommendation to autonomous action raises the stakes exponentially. When agents can independently trigger purchase orders, reroute shipments, or approve exceptions, bad context can mean catastrophically bad outcomes at scale.Celosphere attendees will get to see first-hand how companies are using the Celonis Orchestration Engine to coordinate AI agents alongside people and systems. Effective orchestration is a crucial protection against the chaos of agents working at cross-purposes, duplicating actions, or letting crucial steps fall through the cracks. Navigating tariffs and supply chain shocksGlobal trade volatility isn&#x27;t just a headline — it&#x27;s an operational nightmare reshaping how companies deploy AI, Rinke says. New tariffs trigger cascading effects across procurement, logistics, and compliance. Each policy shift can cascade across thousands of SKUs — forcing new supplier contracts, rerouted shipments, and rebalanced inventories. For AI systems trained on static conditions, that volatility is almost impossible to predict. Traditional AI systems struggle with such variability — but process intelligence gives organizations real-time visibility into how changes ripple through operations.Celosphere case studies will show how companies turn disruption into advantage. Smurfit Westrock uses PI to optimize inventory and reduce costs amid tariff uncertainty, while ASOS leverages PI to optimize its supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and continuing to deliver an outstanding customer experience.Platform over point solutionsRinke argues that Celonis’ edge lies in treating process intelligence not as an add-on, but as the foundation of the enterprise stack. Unlike bolt-on optimization tools, the Celonis platform creates a living digital twin of business operations — a continuously updated model enriched by context that lets AI operate effectively from analysis to execution.“What sets Celonis apart is visibility across systems and offline tasks, which is critical for true intelligent automation,” Rinke says. “The platform offers comprehensive capabilities spanning process analysis, design, and orchestration rather than a point solution.”“Free the Process” and the future of AICelonis continues to champion openness through its “Free the Process” movement, promoting fair competition and freeing enterprises from legacy lock-in. By giving organizations full access to their own process data, open APIs, and a growing partner network that includes The Hackett Group, ClearOps, and Lobster, Celonis is building the connective tissue for a new era of interoperable automation.For Rinke, this open foundation is what turns AI from a set of experiments into an enterprise engine. “Process intelligence creates a flywheel,” he says. “Better understanding leads to better optimization, which enables better AI — and that, in turn, drives even greater understanding. There is no AI without PI.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous security researcher agent now available in private beta.Designed to emulate how human experts identify and resolve software vulnerabilities, Aardvark offers a multi-stage, LLM-driven approach for continuous, 24/7/365 code analysis, exploit validation, and patch generation!Positioned as a scalable defense tool for modern software development environments, Aardvark is being tested across internal and external codebases. OpenAI reports high recall and real-world effectiveness in identifying known and synthetic vulnerabilities, with early deployments surfacing previously undetected security issues.Aardvark comes on the heels of OpenAI’s release of the gpt-oss-safeguard models yesterday, extending the company’s recent emphasis on agentic and policy-aligned systems. Technical Design and OperationAardvark operates as an agentic system that continuously analyzes source code repositories. Unlike conventional tools that rely on fuzzing or software composition analysis, Aardvark leverages LLM reasoning and tool-use capabilities to interpret code behavior and identify vulnerabilities. It simulates a security researcher’s workflow by reading code, conducting semantic analysis, writing and executing test cases, and using diagnostic tools.Its process follows a structured multi-stage pipeline:Threat Modeling – Aardvark initiates its analysis by ingesting an entire code repository to generate a threat model. This model reflects the inferred security objectives and architectural design of the software.Commit-Level Scanning – As code changes are committed, Aardvark compares diffs against the repository’s threat model to detect potential vulnerabilities. It also performs historical scans when a repository is first connected.Validation Sandbox – Detected vulnerabilities are tested in an isolated environment to confirm exploitability. This reduces false positives and enhances report accuracy.Automated Patching – The system integrates with OpenAI Codex to generate patches. These proposed fixes are then reviewed and submitted via pull requests for developer approval.Aardvark integrates with GitHub, Codex, and common development pipelines to provide continuous, non-intrusive security scanning. All insights are intended to be human-auditable, with clear annotations and reproducibility.Performance and ApplicationAccording to OpenAI, Aardvark has been operational for several months on internal codebases and with select alpha partners. In benchmark testing on “golden” repositories—where known and synthetic vulnerabilities were seeded—Aardvark identified 92% of total issues. OpenAI emphasizes that its accuracy and low false positive rate are key differentiators.The agent has also been deployed on open-source projects. To date, it has discovered multiple critical issues, including ten vulnerabilities that were assigned CVE identifiers. OpenAI states that all findings were responsibly disclosed under its recently updated coordinated disclosure policy, which favors collaboration over rigid timelines.In practice, Aardvark has surfaced complex bugs beyond traditional security flaws, including logic errors, incomplete fixes, and privacy risks. This suggests broader utility beyond security-specific contexts.Integration and RequirementsDuring the private beta, Aardvark is only available to organizations using GitHub Cloud (github.com). OpenAI invites beta testers to sign up here online by filling out a web form. Participation requirements include:Integration with GitHub CloudCommitment to interact with Aardvark and provide qualitative feedbackAgreement to beta-specific terms and privacy policiesOpenAI confirmed that code submitted to Aardvark during the beta will not be used to train its models.The company is also offering pro bono vulnerability scanning for selected non-commercial open-source repositories, citing its intent to contribute to the health of the software supply chain.Strategic ContextThe launch of Aardvark signals OpenAI’s broader movement into agentic AI systems with domain-specific capabilities. While OpenAI is best known for its general-purpose models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5), Aardvark is part of a growing trend of specialized AI agents designed to operate semi-autonomously within real-world environments. In fact, it joins two other active OpenAI agents now:ChatGPT agent, unveiled back in July 2025, which controls a virtual computer and web browser and can create and edit common productivity filesCodex — previously the name of OpenAI&#x27;s open source coding model, which it took and re-used as the name of its new GPT-5 variant-powered AI coding agent unveiled back in May 2025But a security-focused agent makes a lot of sense, especially as demands on security teams grow.In 2024 alone, over 40,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were reported, and OpenAI’s internal data suggests that 1.2% of all code commits introduce bugs. Aardvark’s positioning as a “defender-first” AI aligns with a market need for proactive security tools that integrate tightly with developer workflows rather than operate as post-hoc scanning layers.OpenAI’s coordinated disclosure policy updates further reinforce its commitment to sustainable collaboration with developers and the open-source community, rather than emphasizing adversarial vulnerability reporting.While yesterday&#x27;s release of oss-safeguard uses chain-of-thought reasoning to apply safety policies during inference, Aardvark applies similar LLM reasoning to secure evolving codebases. Together, these tools signal OpenAI’s shift from static tooling toward flexible, continuously adaptive systems — one focused on content moderation, the other on proactive vulnerability detection and automated patching within real-world software development environments.What It Means For Enterprises and the CyberSec Market Going ForwardAardvark represents OpenAI’s entry into automated security research through agentic AI. By combining GPT-5’s language understanding with Codex-driven patching and validation sandboxes, Aardvark offers an integrated solution for modern software teams facing increasing security complexity.While currently in limited beta, the early performance indicators suggest potential for broader adoption. If proven effective at scale, Aardvark could contribute to a shift in how organizations embed security into continuous development environments.For security leaders tasked with managing incident response, threat detection, and day-to-day protections—particularly those operating with limited team capacity—Aardvark may serve as a force multiplier. Its autonomous validation pipeline and human-auditable patch proposals could streamline triage and reduce alert fatigue, enabling smaller security teams to focus on strategic incidents rather than manual scanning and follow-up.AI engineers responsible for integrating models into live products may benefit from Aardvark’s ability to surface bugs that arise from subtle logic flaws or incomplete fixes, particularly in fast-moving development cycles. Because Aardvark monitors commit-level changes and tracks them against threat models, it may help prevent vulnerabilities introduced during rapid iteration, without slowing delivery timelines.For teams orchestrating AI across distributed environments, Aardvark’s sandbox validation and continuous feedback loops could align well with CI/CD-style pipelines for ML systems. Its ability to plug into GitHub workflows positions it as a compatible addition to modern AI operations stacks, especially those aiming to integrate robust security checks into automation pipelines without additional overhead.And for data infrastructure teams maintaining critical pipelines and tooling, Aardvark’s LLM-driven inspection capabilities could offer an added layer of resilience. Vulnerabilities in data orchestration layers often go unnoticed until exploited; Aardvark’s ongoing code review process may surface issues earlier in the development lifecycle, helping data engineers maintain both system integrity and uptime.In practice, Aardvark represents a shift in how security expertise might be operationalized—not just as a defensive perimeter, but as a persistent, context-aware participant in the software lifecycle. Its design suggests a model where defenders are no longer bottlenecked by scale, but augmented by intelligent agents working alongside them.",

          "title": "Oakley Meta Vanguard review: Sporty to a fault",
          "standfirst": "By now, I have a well-established routine when I set up a new pair of Meta smart glasses. I connect my Instagram, WhatsApp and Spotify accounts. I complete the slightly convoluted steps in my Bluetooth settings to make sure Meta AI can announce incoming phone calls and text messages. I tweak the video settings to the highest quality available, and change the voice of Meta AI to \"English (UK)\" so it can talk to me in the voice of Judi Dench. But with the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, there's also a new step: deciding what the customizable \"action button\" should do. The action button isn't even my favorite part of using the glasses, but it's a sign of just how different these shades are from the rest of Meta's lineup. While the second-gen Ray-Ban and Oakley HSTN glasses iterated on the same formula Meta has used for the last few years, the Vanguard glasses are refreshingly different. They aren't really meant to be everyday sunglasses (unless you're really committed to your athletic pursuits) but they are in many ways more capable than Meta's other smart glasses. The speakers are louder, the camera has new abilities and they integrate directly with Strava and Garmin. And while these won't replace my go-to sunglasses, there's more than enough to make them part of my fitness routine.New look, new setupThe sunglasses were very clearly made with athletes in mind. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are the type of shades a lot of people probably think of when they hear \"Oakley sunglasses.\" The wraparound frames with colorful, reflective lenses are the style of glasses you might associate with a high school track coach, or your neighbor who is really serious about cycling.The pair I tested had black frames and Oakley's orange \"Prizm 24K\" lenses, which aren't polarized but are favored by a lot of athletes for their ability to dial up the contrast of your surroundings. I was able to comfortably wear my pair in bright, sunny conditions and also in more overcast lower light. I also appreciate that the lenses are swappable, so you can switch them out for a dedicated low-light or different-colored lens depending on your conditions. (Extra lenses cost $85 each and will be available to purchase separately soon, according to Meta.) These glasses don't, however, support prescription lenses of any kind. I wouldn't wear these as everyday sunglasses, but I don't mind the look for a trail run.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI realize this style of sunglasses won't be appealing to everyone, but the frame shape does enable a slightly different setup than what we've seen with any of Meta's other smart glasses. Most noticeably, the camera is in the center of the glasses, just above the nosebridge. The LED that lights up when the camera is on is also in the center, near the top of the frames. As with Meta's other smart glasses, you can control volume and music playback via a touchpad on the right side of the glasses, but the capture button to take photos and videos is now on the underside of the glasses rather than on top. This is meant to make it a bit easier to reach if you're wearing a hat or helmet, though I found it took me a few tries to get used to the new placement. Behind the capture button is the previously mentioned \"action button,\" which can be customized to trigger specific functions via the Meta AI app. The capture button (left) and the action button (right) are both on the underside of the frames rather than on top.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI haven't yet figured out what the best use for the action button is, though I've tried out a few different setups. On one hike, I set it up to automatically call my husband, kind of like a speed dial. During a bike ride, I had it set to record a hyperlapse video. I've also tried it out as a shortcut for launching a specific Spotify playlist or as a general trigger for Meta AI. With all of these, I appreciated that the action button allowed me to do something without saying the \"Hey Meta,\" command. Repeating \"hey Meta\" to my glasses in public has always felt a bit cringey, so it was nice to have a much more subtle cue available. Did I mention it's for athletes?The Vanguard's athlete-focused features go beyond the sportier frames. The shades come with new integrations for two of the most popular run and bike-tracking platforms: Garmin and Strava. If you have a supported Garmin watch or bike computer, you can set up the glasses to automatically capture video clips based on metrics from your activity, like hitting a particular heart rate zone or other milestone. You can also ask Meta AI directly to tell you about stats from your Garmin watch, like \"hey Meta, what's my pace.\" I don't have a Garmin watch, though I did briefly test out some of these features during my hands-on at Meta Connect. I suspect a lot of runners and cyclists may still find it easier to simply glance at their watch to see stats, but having it all available via voice commands doesn't seem like a bad thing either.Strava's integration isn't quite as deep. If you're tracking a run, hike or ride while wearing the glasses, you can overlay your stats directly onto photos and videos from your activity. This includes metrics like distance and elevation, as well as heart rate if you're also wearing an Apple Watch or other tracker that's connected to the Strava app. Here's what it looks like with a photo from a recent bike ride. You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI typically don’t share stats from runs or bike rides (usually because they aren't that impressive) but it's a bit more appealing that just sharing a straight Strava screenshot. Another neat feature is that if you share a video, you can watch the stats change in real time alongside your recording. That level of detail isn't particularly interesting for a mostly flat bike ride on a city street, but I can see how it would be a lot more compelling on a more technical trail ride or in a race. My only complaint, really, is that Meta has limited these kinds of features to Garmin and Strava's platforms so far. I'd love to have support for my favorite ski-tracking app, Slopes, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be happy to have an integration with their running or workout-tracking app of choice. Meta has announced some plans to bring more third-party apps onto its smart glasses platform so there might be hope here. There are other improvements, though, that will be appealing to even casual athletes. The speakers are a lot louder to account for potentially noisy conditions like a congested roadway or high-wind environment. I never had to crank the volume up anywhere near the max during my bike rides or runs, but I can say the speakers were loud and clear enough that I was able to comfortably listen to a podcast with the glasses laying next to me on the couch at full volume.The new centered camera placement is meant to make it harder for a hat or helmet to interfere with your shots, which has been a consistent issue for me with Meta's other smart glasses. The new position didn't totally solve this — I still found that my bike helmet made it into the top of my pics — but at least it's easier to crop out now that my headgear is centered over the top of my image rather than awkwardly sticking out on one side.The 12MP ultra-wide camera also comes with new video stabilization settings that make it feel a bit more like a replacement for an action cam. The glasses are set to automatically select a level of stabilization based on your motion, but you can also manually choose between low, medium or high stabilization (stabilization is locked at \"medium\" if you opt to record in 3K). I've mostly left it with the default settings and have been impressed with the results. The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Vanguard glasses are also Meta's first smart glasses that can record hyperlapse and slow-motion video. Hyperlapse should be familiar to Instagram users who used the now-defunct app of the same name to record timelapse clips. Now, you can say \"Hey Meta, start a hyperlapse\" and the glasses will record a similar sped-up clip. My hyperlapse clips ended up looking a bit jittery, though, compared to the timelapse shots I'm used to getting with my GoPro. And unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the cadence of the video like you used to be able to with the dedicated app. My slow-motion clips, on the other hand, came out better. It's not something I'd expect to use very often during a bike ride or trail run, but the POV angle is great for recording clips of pets or kids. Meta is also planning to bring support for hyperlapse and slow-motion videos to the rest of its glasses lineup, though, so you don't need to get these particular shades to take advantage of the feature.The other major improvement is battery life. The Vanguard glasses have a notably better battery life compared with the second-gen Ray-Ban glasses or the HSTN frames (probably because the bigger frames allow for a larger battery). According to Meta, the Vanguard glasses can go nine hours on a charge with \"typical use\" or six hours with continuous audio playback. I was actually able to get a little over six hours of audio on a single charge, so they should hold up pretty well if you're running marathons or competing in longer races. As usual, exact battery life can vary a lot depending on how much you're using more resource-intensive features like video recording or Meta AI.The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. Karissa Bell for EngadgetI'm especially looking forward to seeing how these glasses will hold up during a day of snowboarding. Meta previously told me that the battery has been optimized for a wider spectrum of temperatures so hopefully the battery won't drain as quickly on the mountain as Meta's other glasses. And with increased water resistance — the shades have an IP67 rating — I wouldn't worry about dropping them in the snow. Should you buy these?While Meta and EssilorLuxottica have gotten very good at making smart glasses (sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I won't call them \"AI glasses,\") they are still somewhat of a niche product. And the ultra-sporty Oakley Vanguard glasses are even more niche. At $499, these are also more expensive than other models.That, understandably, may feel too steep for a pair of sunglasses you're likely only going to wear during specific activities. But if you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like. The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share. Ready-made Garmin and Strava integrations are practically begging for you to brag about your latest PR or race time, which will certainly appeal to many.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html?src=rss",

(Extra lenses cost $85 each and will be available to purchase separately soon, according to Meta.) These glasses don't, however, support prescription lenses of any kind. I wouldn't wear these as everyday sunglasses, but I don't mind the look for a trail run.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI realize this style of sunglasses won't be appealing to everyone, but the frame shape does enable a slightly different setup than what we've seen with any of Meta's other smart glasses. Most noticeably, the camera is in the center of the glasses, just above the nosebridge. The LED that lights up when the camera is on is also in the center, near the top of the frames. As with Meta's other smart glasses, you can control volume and music playback via a touchpad on the right side of the glasses, but the capture button to take photos and videos is now on the underside of the glasses rather than on top. This is meant to make it a bit easier to reach if you're wearing a hat or helmet, though I found it took me a few tries to get used to the new placement. Behind the capture button is the previously mentioned \"action button,\" which can be customized to trigger specific functions via the Meta AI app. The capture button (left) and the action button (right) are both on the underside of the frames rather than on top.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI haven't yet figured out what the best use for the action button is, though I've tried out a few different setups. On one hike, I set it up to automatically call my husband, kind of like a speed dial. During a bike ride, I had it set to record a hyperlapse video. I've also tried it out as a shortcut for launching a specific Spotify playlist or as a general trigger for Meta AI. With all of these, I appreciated that the action button allowed me to do something without saying the \"Hey Meta,\" command. Repeating \"hey Meta\" to my glasses in public has always felt a bit cringey, so it was nice to have a much more subtle cue available. Did I mention it's for athletes?The Vanguard's athlete-focused features go beyond the sportier frames. The shades come with new integrations for two of the most popular run and bike-tracking platforms: Garmin and Strava. If you have a supported Garmin watch or bike computer, you can set up the glasses to automatically capture video clips based on metrics from your activity, like hitting a particular heart rate zone or other milestone. You can also ask Meta AI directly to tell you about stats from your Garmin watch, like \"hey Meta, what's my pace.\" I don't have a Garmin watch, though I did briefly test out some of these features during my hands-on at Meta Connect. I suspect a lot of runners and cyclists may still find it easier to simply glance at their watch to see stats, but having it all available via voice commands doesn't seem like a bad thing either.Strava's integration isn't quite as deep. If you're tracking a run, hike or ride while wearing the glasses, you can overlay your stats directly onto photos and videos from your activity. This includes metrics like distance and elevation, as well as heart rate if you're also wearing an Apple Watch or other tracker that's connected to the Strava app. Here's what it looks like with a photo from a recent bike ride. You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI typically don’t share stats from runs or bike rides (usually because they aren't that impressive) but it's a bit more appealing that just sharing a straight Strava screenshot. Another neat feature is that if you share a video, you can watch the stats change in real time alongside your recording. That level of detail isn't particularly interesting for a mostly flat bike ride on a city street, but I can see how it would be a lot more compelling on a more technical trail ride or in a race. My only complaint, really, is that Meta has limited these kinds of features to Garmin and Strava's platforms so far. I'd love to have support for my favorite ski-tracking app, Slopes, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be happy to have an integration with their running or workout-tracking app of choice. Meta has announced some plans to bring more third-party apps onto its smart glasses platform so there might be hope here. There are other improvements, though, that will be appealing to even casual athletes. The speakers are a lot louder to account for potentially noisy conditions like a congested roadway or high-wind environment. I never had to crank the volume up anywhere near the max during my bike rides or runs, but I can say the speakers were loud and clear enough that I was able to comfortably listen to a podcast with the glasses laying next to me on the couch at full volume.The new centered camera placement is meant to make it harder for a hat or helmet to interfere with your shots, which has been a consistent issue for me with Meta's other smart glasses. The new position didn't totally solve this — I still found that my bike helmet made it into the top of my pics — but at least it's easier to crop out now that my headgear is centered over the top of my image rather than awkwardly sticking out on one side.The 12MP ultra-wide camera also comes with new video stabilization settings that make it feel a bit more like a replacement for an action cam. The glasses are set to automatically select a level of stabilization based on your motion, but you can also manually choose between low, medium or high stabilization (stabilization is locked at \"medium\" if you opt to record in 3K). I've mostly left it with the default settings and have been impressed with the results. The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Vanguard glasses are also Meta's first smart glasses that can record hyperlapse and slow-motion video. Hyperlapse should be familiar to Instagram users who used the now-defunct app of the same name to record timelapse clips. Now, you can say \"Hey Meta, start a hyperlapse\" and the glasses will record a similar sped-up clip. My hyperlapse clips ended up looking a bit jittery, though, compared to the timelapse shots I'm used to getting with my GoPro. And unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the cadence of the video like you used to be able to with the dedicated app. My slow-motion clips, on the other hand, came out better. It's not something I'd expect to use very often during a bike ride or trail run, but the POV angle is great for recording clips of pets or kids. Meta is also planning to bring support for hyperlapse and slow-motion videos to the rest of its glasses lineup, though, so you don't need to get these particular shades to take advantage of the feature.The other major improvement is battery life. The Vanguard glasses have a notably better battery life compared with the second-gen Ray-Ban glasses or the HSTN frames (probably because the bigger frames allow for a larger battery). According to Meta, the Vanguard glasses can go nine hours on a charge with \"typical use\" or six hours with continuous audio playback. I was actually able to get a little over six hours of audio on a single charge, so they should hold up pretty well if you're running marathons or competing in longer races. As usual, exact battery life can vary a lot depending on how much you're using more resource-intensive features like video recording or Meta AI.The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. Karissa Bell for EngadgetI'm especially looking forward to seeing how these glasses will hold up during a day of snowboarding. Meta previously told me that the battery has been optimized for a wider spectrum of temperatures so hopefully the battery won't drain as quickly on the mountain as Meta's other glasses. And with increased water resistance — the shades have an IP67 rating — I wouldn't worry about dropping them in the snow. Should you buy these?While Meta and EssilorLuxottica have gotten very good at making smart glasses (sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I won't call them \"AI glasses,\") they are still somewhat of a niche product. And the ultra-sporty Oakley Vanguard glasses are even more niche. At $499, these are also more expensive than other models.That, understandably, may feel too steep for a pair of sunglasses you're likely only going to wear during specific activities. But if you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like. The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share. Ready-made Garmin and Strava integrations are practically begging for you to brag about your latest PR or race time, which will certainly appeal to many.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Fractal Design Scape review: A stellar debut",
          "standfirst": "Unless you're a PC nerd like me, chances are you're not familiar with Fractal Design. The company has made a name for itself in recent years by designing some of the best cases you can buy for a DIY build. In a space known for its gaudy aesthetics, Fractal's products stand out for their simplicity. Now the company is entering the crowded audio space with the $200 Scape, a gaming headset that not only looks sophisticated, but also sounds surprisingly great too. Design The Fractal Scape features an attractive mix of materials. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget I mentioned the design of the Scape first, and for good reason. It shows attention to detail, with a lot of thoughtful flourishes. The best of those is the dock that comes included with the headset. It charges the Scape inductively, so there's no need to align any charging pins, and it cleverly houses the headset's 2.4GHz wireless transmitter. When connected to your main PC, the dongle can sit inside the dock, ready to go when you want to use it with your PlayStation 5, PS4, Nintendo Switch or another PC or Mac (sorry, Microsoft fans, there's no Xbox support). The base also has wire channels to make cable management easy. Those same thoughtful design touches extend to the headset itself. On the back are four buttons, a dial and a toggle that cover nearly every function of the Scape. You can adjust the volume, mute the built-in mic, switch between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity, power the headset on or off, turn the RGB lighting on or off and switch between three EQ presets. What’s more, all of the controls feel distinct and are easy to use. There's also a USB-C connection for wired audio and a three-pole headphone jack for the detachable microphone. The headset is primarily made of plastic, with a touch of brushed metal. Fractal offers the Scape in two colors — the aptly named light and dark — and despite the company's choice of materials, the headset feels undoubtedly premium. Tilt adjustment is limited — it's not possible to lay the ear pads flat on a table, for example — but the headband offers a fair amount of resistance, adding to the high-end feel. That said, the Scape could be more comfortable. Clamping force feels just about right, but there's not enough padding along the top of the headband. I found I could wear the headphones for a few hours, but I eventually had to take them off to relieve the pressure that had built up on the top of my head. I'm also not a fan of the fabric Fractal used for both the headband and ear pads. It feels scratchy and it's not great at dissipating heat. Thankfully, the high-density memory foam beneath is plush and the pads were deep and wide enough to comfortably accommodate my ears. Fractal has made it easy to swap the ear pads if needed; they come right off with just a small amount of force. For the time being, the company isn't selling replacements, but a spokesperson told me Fractal will send customers who need new pads a set for free. You just need to contact their support team. Sound quality The Scape comes with a set of custom-tuned drivers. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget Out of the box, the Scape's dynamic drivers are tuned to a soft v-shaped curve, with an emphasis on accuracy over character. Bass frequencies are punchy without being bloated, and there's nice detail to mid-focused instruments like guitars. To my ear, the one issue with the Scape's default tuning were the upper mids and treble frequencies. They weren't shouty to the point of being sibilant, but there was definitely a harshness to the vocals of singers like Jeff Buckley and Caroline Polachek who are known for their falsetto. Thankfully, this was easy to fix with the Scape's built-in EQ settings. I'll have more to say in the software section of this review, but Fractal's Adjust app allows you to make parametric EQ adjustments. This is different to most gaming headsets, which often limit people to restrictive fixed-band tweaks. Even when I used just five potential points of customization, I found I had a great deal of control over the tonality of the Scape. Overall, for casual music listening these are excellent headphones capable of covering many different genres. When it comes to gaming, they're great too — with some caveats. For singleplayer games, the default tunings are an excellent match. Playing Ghost of Tsushima, the Scape did a great job of reproducing the game's immersive sound design, allowing me to soak in all the little audio details Sucker Punch packed into its rendition of 13th century Japan. The soundstaging isn't as expansive and lush as I'm used to with my Sennheiser HD 600, but for a pair of closed-back headphones, it's above average. When it comes to competitive first-person shooters, some tweaks are required. I found all the default presets produced too much bass to easily isolate sound cues in games like Valorant. Again, Fractal's software made this simple to fix; however, the Scape can only store three presets. Some gaming headsets, particularly those from Steelseries, come with tunings for hundreds of different games. For the ultra-competitive gamer, this can be useful since every game has a different sound engine. I'm not one of those people, so I found the Scape had just the right amount of customization. A closeup of the Scape's volume dial. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget One feature you won't find on these headphones is active noise cancellation (ANC). Don't get me wrong, ANC is great, but I also didn't feel like the Scape was a worse product without it. My girlfriend is a Pelton fanatic and she does all of her daily classes without wearing headphones in our small apartment. In that situation, the Scape's passive noise isolation was enough to block the loud music coming from those workouts. That said, the one area where the Scape could have been better is Bluetooth connectivity. It's a 5.3 headset, but codec support is limited to SBC and AAC. If you've ever tried a pair of wireless headphones only to be disappointed by how they sounded, SBC was probably to blame. When I used the Scape over Bluetooth, there was a subtle difference, but in a beat 'em up like Absolum, the game's excellent sound design was less effective because it sounded more compressed, with more lag between what was happening on-screen and the effects that followed. I would have liked to see Fractal support more modern codecs like aptX Adaptive, but given that you need a dongle like the Creative BT-W6 to get access to those protocols on PCs and consoles, I can't fault the company for its decision. Also missing from the Bluetooth equation is multipoint support, meaning I wasn't able to connect the Scape to my PC or Switch and my iPhone at the same time. The Scape's detachable microphone is fine but uninspiring. In listening back to a chat I had with some friends over Discord, I found the Scape compressed my voice to the point where there wasn't a lot of life or nuance to it. The optional noise cancellation algorithm does a good job of filtering out nearby commotion, but does so at the expense of adding more compression. You can flip the microphone to mute yourself, and if you're feeling lazy, the Scape also has a built-in mic — though it sounds about as good as you might imagine. Still, it's handy in a pinch. Software Fractal's Adjust app is web-based and easy to use. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget I mentioned Fractal's Adjust software, but what I didn't note is that it's not an app you need to install on your computer. Instead, it's a website you can access through any Chrome-based browser. It's a small thing, but one I really appreciate. I can't count how many times I've had to troubleshoot issues with Windows that were caused by a conflict created by Logitech G Hub or NZXT Cam. The web-based software itself is simple, with two pages, named Lighting and Audio, encompassing all the options you can tweak. The Scape comes with 10 lighting themes out of the box, and like the headset itself, these presets are understated and classy. Naturally, you can also create your own lighting schemes, and the tool for doing so is fairly robust. A closeup of the Fractal Scape's EQ button Igor Bonifacic for Engadget When it comes to the EQ adjustments you can make with the Adjust app, the one thing I'll add here is any presets you save are stored on the Scape, so they're available everywhere you want to use the headset. That was great because it meant I didn't need to Alt-Tab out of a game to switch the headset to a more competitive tuning. The one area where Fractal's software feels lacking is when it comes to microphone controls. It's possible to adjust sidetone (the volume of your mic input as heard through the headset) and enable microphone noise cancellation, but that’s it. It'd be nice if it was possible to configure those settings for the two mics independently of one another, but the software doesn't support that right now. Battery life According to Fractal, the Scape can go up to 40 hours on a single charge with RGB lighting off. With the feature turned on, battery life drops to about 26 hours. I'll be honest, I had a tough time putting those claims to the test because of how easy it is to charge the headset. As best as I can tell, those estimates are accurate. I managed to get three days of battery life from the Scape with the RGB lights turned on and about eight hours of use each day. One nice touch: when you tap the power button, the RGB lights will briefly illuminate to indicate how much battery life the Scape has left. Those same lights will turn off when you place the headset to charge so that they're not distracting. The competition With the Scape, Fractal has entered a crowded market. That said, the Scape is competitive with some of the best gaming headsets you can buy right now. At $200, it's $100 cheaper than the Audeze Maxwell, Engadget's pick for the best premium gaming headset. The Scape doesn't sound as good as the Maxwell or offer LDAC support for Bluetooth connectivity, but it's lighter and charging is easier thanks to the included charging base. If you ask me, the Scape also looks a lot better too. If you can't live without ANC, your best bet is Razer's BlackShark V3 Pro, but it costs $50 more and doesn't sound as good as the Scape. You also need to put up with Razer's annoying Synapse software. For the best mic on a gaming headset, my longstanding recommendation has been the $199 Drop PC38X. It also has one of the best default tunings for competitive gaming. However, it's a wired headset, and Drop doesn’t offer a wireless option. Wrap-up The charging station also houses the Scape's 2.4GHz transmitter. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget If you can't tell by now, I think the Fractal Scape is a great gaming headset. There are models like the Audeze Maxwell that beat it in one or two categories, but for $200 the Scape is an excellent all-around package. Nitpicks about comfort aside, the Scape sounds and looks great. It's also a tremendous first effort by Fractal, and I can't wait to see what the company does next in the audio space and beyond.

It's possible to adjust sidetone (the volume of your mic input as heard through the headset) and enable microphone noise cancellation, but that’s it. It'd be nice if it was possible to configure those settings for the two mics independently of one another, but the software doesn't support that right now. Battery life According to Fractal, the Scape can go up to 40 hours on a single charge with RGB lighting off. With the feature turned on, battery life drops to about 26 hours. I'll be honest, I had a tough time putting those claims to the test because of how easy it is to charge the headset. As best as I can tell, those estimates are accurate. I managed to get three days of battery life from the Scape with the RGB lights turned on and about eight hours of use each day. One nice touch: when you tap the power button, the RGB lights will briefly illuminate to indicate how much battery life the Scape has left. Those same lights will turn off when you place the headset to charge so that they're not distracting. The competition With the Scape, Fractal has entered a crowded market. That said, the Scape is competitive with some of the best gaming headsets you can buy right now. At $200, it's $100 cheaper than the Audeze Maxwell, Engadget's pick for the best premium gaming headset. The Scape doesn't sound as good as the Maxwell or offer LDAC support for Bluetooth connectivity, but it's lighter and charging is easier thanks to the included charging base. If you ask me, the Scape also looks a lot better too. If you can't live without ANC, your best bet is Razer's BlackShark V3 Pro, but it costs $50 more and doesn't sound as good as the Scape. You also need to put up with Razer's annoying Synapse software. For the best mic on a gaming headset, my longstanding recommendation has been the $199 Drop PC38X. It also has one of the best default tunings for competitive gaming. However, it's a wired headset, and Drop doesn’t offer a wireless option. Wrap-up The charging station also houses the Scape's 2.4GHz transmitter. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget If you can't tell by now, I think the Fractal Scape is a great gaming headset. There are models like the Audeze Maxwell that beat it in one or two categories, but for $200 the Scape is an excellent all-around package. Nitpicks about comfort aside, the Scape sounds and looks great. It's also a tremendous first effort by Fractal, and I can't wait to see what the company does next in the audio space and beyond.

          "standfirst": "It's been around three and a half years since season four of Stranger Things premiered. We finally have an actual trailer for the fifth and final season of Netflix's retro-soaked adventure series. It's a good thing, as the first batch of episodes drop on November 26. As previously mentioned, this is a real trailer with tons of footage and not a teaser. It's over two minutes of Hawkins-based goodness. This is an action-packed affair that's heavy on emotion and light on the type of 1980s-style humor the show has become known for. That seems right, given the stakes are higher than ever. If you just clicked on this and don't plan on actually watching the trailer, this is when I go into some light spoilers. It looks like the gang is trapped in Hawkins following the events of season four. There's a military enclosure around the city and, surprise, Vecna is back and looking for vengeance. There's a very scary scene in which the entity looks to be controlling or torturing poor Will and we don't even know if he has a cassette player loaded with Kate Bush just out of frame. It's all very tense. While the show premieres on November 26, this isn't a one-and-done season drop like many Netflix shows. It's being split into three installments. The first batch of episodes are set for November 26, with another batch dropping on December 25. The final episode will air on December 31 and is even coming to some movie theaters. It's a holiday miracle. The showrunners do promise that this season will finally tell us exactly what the upside down is, which is something to look forward to. While Stranger Things is ending, the franchise will continue on. Netflix has some spinoffs planned for the future, but they won't have series creators the Duffer Brothers on board as showrunners. The pair recently signed a deal with Paramount.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/we-finally-have-a-real-deal-trailer-for-stranger-things-season-five-160222670.html?src=rss",

          "title": "How to cancel Norton VPN, uninstall it and get your money back",
          "standfirst": "Norton Security has some reliable products, but its VPN isn't one of them. In my Norton VPN review, I argued that it's only really worthwhile if you can get a discount on it as part of a Norton 360 package — and even in that case, you should only use it for non-sensitive activities due to some holes in Norton's comprehensive privacy policy. That's a lot of conditions, so I'd understand if you're here because you've decided Norton VPN isn't for you. Read on to learn your options for cancelling this VPN, getting a refund and replacing it with a better provider. How to turn off Norton VPN auto-renewal The simplest way to cancel Norton VPN is to stop your subscription from automatically renewing. That way, you'll have until your plan expires to look for a new VPN. Note that the steps below are the same no matter how you got Norton VPN, whether on its own or as part of Norton 360 — though they only apply if you subscribed through the Norton website, not an app store. Sign into your account at my.norton.com. You'll be taken to your account dashboard with your subscriptions tab visible. If it's not, click on My Subscriptions. On your subscriptions hub, find the plan you get Norton VPN through. Click the words Manage Renewal or Cancel Subscription Renewal. In the window that appears, click Unsubscribe. Select a reason for cancellation (no need to be truthful) and click Next. At this point, you'll have to wade through several pleas for you to stay. Stand firm and keep clicking through until you can click No thanks, cancel my subscription. Continue clicking Next until you see a confirmation that auto-renewal has been turned off. Wait 24 hours for the change to take effect. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you change your mind after turning auto-renewal off, you can turn it back on again anytime before the subscription expires. For those who bought through an app store, there's no way to turn off auto-renewal; you can only cancel the subscription altogether. See the end of the next section to learn how to do that. How to cancel Norton VPN and get a refund You can request a refund on any annual subscription for 60 days after paying. Monthly subscriptions can only be refunded once, within 14 days of paying — if you renew a monthly plan then decide to cancel, you're out of luck. The only way to get a refund is to contact Norton directly. If you're ready to go cold turkey, follow these steps. In a browser, open support.norton.com. Scroll down until you see nine buttons arranged in a 3x3 grid. Find the second button down in the left-hand column, Contact us, and click on it. Enter the email address for your Norton account. Check that inbox for a verification code, then enter it in the next box and click Verify. When the live chat asks you what you need help with, select Purchase & Billing, then Request refund. Give a reason in the dropdown menu. As usual, be persistent until you get a message in writing that your refund will be processed. Wait at least three days for the money to appear. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you subscribed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you'll have to cancel through the same platform where you started. Just go into the subscriptions page of the store's mobile app, find your Norton VPN subscription and click the Cancel button beside it. After that, just follow the prompts, then request a refund using the steps above. How to uninstall Norton VPN To get your money back from Norton, you can't just shut off auto-renewal. You'll have to cancel your plan immediately and delete all Norton apps from your devices. I recommend following these steps even if you aren't eligible for a refund, since Norton software is notoriously hard to uninstall and will crop back up if you don't completely root it out. On Android and iOS, uninstalling Norton VPN is relatively easy — after cancelling your subscription, delete it like you would any other app. Things are a bit trickier on the desktop OSes. On Windows, hold the Windows key and press R to make a black box appear. Type appwiz.cpl and hit Enter. A list of programs should appear; click on Norton VPN, then click Uninstall/Change and follow the instructions. On a Mac, open your Applications folder and find Norton VPN. Click the app icon and drag it to the trash. This should start a separate program called Norton Uninstaller. Click OK, enter your password if asked, then click Uninstall. Finally, you'll need to restart your computer to finish uninstalling. Norton VPN alternatives Once you've dispensed with Norton VPN, you can get started with a provider that fits your needs better. Proton VPN, my current top pick in our guide to the best VPNs, takes privacy more seriously than Norton and has superior app design and speeds. Surfshark is the fastest VPN, NordVPN has the best features and ExpressVPN is the friendliest for beginners.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-norton-vpn-uninstall-it-and-get-your-money-back-150000872.html?src=rss",

The jet, built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, took off from US Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. Flown by Nils Larson, NASA’s lead test pilot for the X-59, the inaugural flight validated the jet’s airworthiness and safety before landing about an hour after takeoff near NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. “X-59 is a symbol of American ingenuity,” acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement. “It’s part of our DNA—the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before.”Read full article Comments",

Creators grew alarmed when educational videos that YouTube had allowed for years were suddenly being bizarrely flagged as “dangerous” or “harmful,” with seemingly no way to trigger human review to overturn removals. AI seemed to be running the show, with creators’ appeals seemingly getting denied faster than a human could possibly review them. Late Friday, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed that videos flagged by Ars have been reinstated, promising that YouTube will take steps to ensure that similar content isn’t removed in the future. But, to creators, it remains unclear why the videos got taken down, as YouTube claimed that both initial enforcement decisions and decisions on appeals were not the result of an automation issue.Read full article Comments",

Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another. That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like polyesters and PET, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they’ve now got very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out. That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.Read full article Comments",

There have been over 150 cases collectively across the two states, mostly in northwestern Mohave County, Arizona, and the southwest health district of Utah, in the past two months. Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only 78.4 percent of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, only 80.7 percent of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community. While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including a new case reported today.Read full article Comments",

Full of nonsensical-sounding features that impressed people who know a little bit about rockets but nothing about cars, the $200,000 electric car promised to have a suction fan and “cold gas thrusters,” plus 620 miles (1,000 km) of range and a whole load of other stuff that’s never happening. Plenty of other electric automakers have introduced electric hypercars in the eight years since Musk declared the second Roadster a thing, with no sign of it being any closer to reality, if the latest job postings are accurate. And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back. And that’s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk’s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman’s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today’s money).

          "content": "When Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for electric vehicles arrived on the market, it cemented the Korean automaker’s place as one of the leaders of its industry. And in the absence of an influx of Chinese EVs, the Ioniq range of cars, crossovers, and SUVs is about as leading-edge as you’ll find in showrooms right now, particularly mainstream brands. The first of the E-GMP cars was the Ioniq 5, which looks like a 1980’s hatch scaled up to the midsize crossover segment. Now made in the US, it has been a firm hit—and at the beginning of the month just got a hefty price cut, to boot. A midsized sedan followed, but these are a less common sight here given American car-buying tastes. Those tastes shaped the Ioniq 9, though. The underlying technology might hail from Hyundai’s Namyang R&D center in South Korea, but the Ioniq 9 is the result of that technology expressed through the tastes of suburban America. Not so much the exterior styling, though. The hood is too low, the corners are more rounded, and it’s generally a less-threatening shape than the average domestic three-row SUV.Read full article Comments",

As previously reported, BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD) found that AT&T violated a rule “by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes,” and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the carrier. The NAD operates the US advertising industry’s system of self-regulation, which is designed to handle complaints that advertisers file against each other and minimize government regulation of false and misleading claims. While it’s clear that both AT&T and T-Mobile have a history of misleading ad campaigns, AT&T portrays itself as a paragon of honesty in new ads calling T-Mobile “the master of breaking promises.” An AT&T press release about the ad campaign said the NAD “asked T-Mobile to correct their marketing claims 16 times over the last four years,” and an AT&T commercial said T-Mobile has faced more challenges for deceptive ads from competitors than all other telecom providers in that time.Read full article Comments",

Musk has criticized NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return US astronauts to the Moon for the first time since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972, as unambitious and too reliant on traditional aerospace contractors.Read full article Comments",

But what do you do when the misbehaving app is the Task Manager itself? After a recent Windows update, some users (including Windows Latest) noticed that closing the Task Manager window was actually failing to close the app, leaving the executable running in memory. More worryingly, each time you open the Task Manager, it spawns a new process on top of the old one, which you can repeat essentially infinitely (or until your PC buckles under the pressure). Each instance of Task Manager takes up around 20MB of system RAM and hovers between 0 and 2 percent CPU usage—if you have just a handful of instances open, it’s unlikely that you’d notice much of a performance impact. But if you use Task Manager frequently or just go a long time between reboots, opening up two or three dozen copies of the process that are all intermittently using a fraction of your CPU can add up, leading to a potentially significant impact on performance and battery life.Read full article Comments",

On Wednesday, Larry Bushart was released from Perry County Jail, where he had spent weeks unable to make bail, which a judge set at $2 million. Prosecutors have not explained why the charges against him were dropped, according to The Intercept, which has been tracking the case closely. However, officials faced mounting pressure following media coverage and a social media campaign called “Free Larry Bushart,” which stoked widespread concern over suspected police censorship of a US citizen over his political views. Bushart is now planning to sue, his attorney Joshua Phillips told The Washington Post.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Two chunks of ocher unearthed at ancient rock shelters in Ukraine were actually Neanderthal crayons, according to a recent study. The pair of artifacts, unearthed from layers 47,000 and 46,000 years old, showed signs of being deliberately shaped into crayons and resharpened over time. A third piece of ocher had been carefully carved with parallel lines. The finds add to the growing body of evidence that Neanderthals had an artistic streak. This piece of yellow ocher was used as a crayon and resharpened before finally being worn blunt and discarded. Credit: D'Errico et al. 2025 Please pass Og the yellow crayon Rock shelters, occupied by Neanderthals between 100,000 and 33,000 years ago, dot the landscape near the modern city of Bilohirsk in Crimea (a peninsula in southern Ukraine). Archaeologists studying those rock shelters have unearthed dozens of chunks of an iron-rich mineral called ocher. Many of them have flakes knocked out or grooves gouged into their surface, which mark how Neanderthals extracted powdery red, orange, or yellow pigment from the stone. D’Errico and his colleagues used X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopes to examine 16 ocher chunks to better understand exactly what ancient Crimean Neanderthals were doing with the stuff. Most of those ocher chunks could have been used for nearly anything. Ocher is handy not just as a pigment but also for tanning animal hides, mixing with resins into adhesives for hafting tools, or even repelling insects and preventing infection. Knapping a few flakes off a hard nodule of ocher, then crushing them into powder (or just carving out a chunk of a softer, more crumbly piece), is a good way to prepare it for any of those uses. But two pieces, both from a site called Zaskalnaya V, were clearly different.Read full article Comments",
