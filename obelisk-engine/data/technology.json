          "content": "On Monday, OpenAI announced it has signed a seven-year, $38 billion deal to buy cloud services from Amazon Web Services to power products like ChatGPT and Sora. It’s the company’s first big computing deal after a fundamental restructuring last week that gave OpenAI more operational and financial freedom from Microsoft. The agreement gives OpenAI access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processors to train and run its AI models. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” OpenAI will reportedly use Amazon Web Services immediately, with all planned capacity set to come online by the end of 2026 and room to expand further in 2027 and beyond. Amazon plans to roll out hundreds of thousands of chips, including Nvidia’s GB200 and GB300 AI accelerators, in data clusters built to power ChatGPT’s responses, generate AI videos, and train OpenAI’s next wave of models.Read full article Comments",

The seven-year partnership comes as Microsoft continues to loosen its grip on OpenAI, dropping its status as its exclusive cloud provider and losing the first right of refusal to host its AI workloads. OpenAI will “immediately” start using AWS compute to train its AI models, according to the press release, with “all capacity targeted to be deployed before the end of 2026, and the ability to expand further into 2027 and beyond.” Last week, OpenAI completed its for-profit restructuring and announced a new deal with Microsoft that will give the company the rights to OpenAI’s technology until it reaches advanced general intelligence (AGI). Under the agreement, OpenAI can work with third parties to develop some AI products and release certain open weight models. The new deal also includes OpenAI’s commitment to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft’s Azure services, dwarfing the $38 billion it will pay Amazon. OpenAI also has a reported $300 billion contract with Oracle as well, while Amazon continues to pour billions of dollars into the AI startup Anthropic.",

Google announced late on Friday that it was pulling Gemma from the platform, but it was vague about the reasoning. The abrupt change appears to be tied to a letter from Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who claims the Gemma model generated false accusations of sexual misconduct against her. Blackburn published her letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday, just hours before the company announced the change to Gemma availability. She demanded Google explain how the model could fail in this way, tying the situation to ongoing hearings that accuse Google and others of creating bots that defame conservatives. At the hearing, Google’s Markham Erickson explained that AI hallucinations are a widespread and known issue in generative AI, and Google does the best it can to mitigate the impact of such mistakes. Although no AI firm has managed to eliminate hallucinations, Google’s Gemini for Home has been particularly hallucination-happy in our testing.Read full article Comments",

The letter states that “CODA considers that the act of replication during the machine learning process may constitute copyright infringement,” since the resulting AI model went on to spit out content with copyrighted characters. Sora 2 generated an avalanche of content containing Japanese IP after it launched on September 30th, prompting Japan’s government to formally ask OpenAI to stop replicating Japanese artwork. This isn’t the first time one of OpenAI’s apps clearly pulled from Japanese media, either — the highlight of GPT-4o’s launch back in March was a proliferation of “Ghibli-style” images. Even Sam Altman’s own profile picture on X is currently a portrait in a style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli. Altman announced last month that OpenAI will be changing Sora’s opt-out policy for IP holders, but CODA claims that the use of an opt-out policy to begin with may have violated Japanese copyright law, stating, “under Japan’s copyright system, prior permission is generally required for the use of copyrighted works, and there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections.” CODA is now requesting on behalf of its members that OpenAI “responds sincerely” to its members’ copyright claims and stops using their content for machine learning without their permission, which seems to include not just Sora output, but also the use of Japanese IP as training data.",
