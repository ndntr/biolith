          "standfirst": "Upgrading to a good SSD can make your computer feel brand new again. Apps open faster, files move in a blink and even older machines start to feel a lot more responsive. It is one of the easiest ways to breathe life into a laptop or desktop without replacing the whole system, and the performance boost is something you notice right away.There are plenty of SSDs to choose from, though, and the naming alone can be confusing if you are not already familiar with the specs. Some drives are built for simple upgrades, while others offer speeds that benefit creators or gamers. To help you sort through it, we tested a wide mix of options and pulled together the best SSDs you can buy right now. Table of contents Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs What to look for in a PC SSD What to look for in portable and USB flash drives A note on console storage SSD FAQs Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs I’ve either tested or personally use daily every storage drive recommended on this list. Out of our top picks, I bought four with my own money after doing about a dozen hours of research. Separately, Engadget Senior Reporter Jeff Dunn has also tested a handful of our recommendations, including the Crucial X9 Pro listed above. What to look for in a PC SSD The most affordable way to add fast storage space to a computer is with a 2.5-inch SATA drive. It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, the best SATA SSDs are an excellent choice if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply. The one downside of SATA drives is that, in terms of responsiveness, they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD will be significantly faster than the best mechanical drives. And with high-capacity, 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk-storage option. If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest SSDs on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved. M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. These drives rely on NVMe NAND technology for their superior performance and durability. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard. If you’re running an AMD system, that means at least a Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPU and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need at least an 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind that Gen4 SSDs typically cost more than their Gen3 counterparts as well. More expensive still are the latest Gen5 models, which offer sequential read speeds of up to 16,000MB/s. However, even if your computer supports the standard, you’re better off buying a more affordable Gen4 or Gen3 drive. At the moment, very few games and applications can take advantage of Gen3 NVMe speeds, let alone Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. What’s more, Gen5 NVMe drives can run hot, which can lead to performance and longevity issues. Your money is better spent on other components, like upgrading your GPU, for now. As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier. Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe. One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters and the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation or firmware before buying a drive to ensure you’re picking up a compatible size. If you’re buying a replacement SSD for the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED, things are less complicated. For Valve’s handheld, you will need a 2230 size NVMe. Simple. If you don’t want to open your Steam Deck, it’s also possible to expand its storage by installing a microSD card. Engadget has a separate guide dedicated to SD card storage, so check that out for additional buying advice. I alluded to this earlier, but the best buying advice I can offer is don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance benchmark tests vary less than you think. If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a higher gigabyte capacity in the future. What to look for in portable and USB flash drives Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the SanDisk Extreme Pro V2 without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The best external hard drives also allow you to transfer data from your Windows PC to a Mac, or other device, if compatible. Be sure to consider this beforehand if you plan to use your portable drive across multiple devices. Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives, including the Samsung SSD T7 Shield, with a high endurance rating. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD. Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best budget external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption. A note on console storage Seagate If PC gaming isn’t your thing and you own an Xbox Series X|S or PS5, outfitting your fancy new console with the fastest possible storage is far more straightforward than doing the same on PC. With a Series X or Series S, your options are limited to options from Seagate and Western Digital. The former offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB models, with the most affordable starting at a not-so-trivial $90. Western Digital’s Expansion Cards are less expensive, with pricing starting at $80 for the 512GB model. The good news is that both options are frequently on sale. Your best bet is to set an alert for the model you want by using a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel. With Sony’s PlayStation 5, upgrading the console’s internal storage is slightly more involved. Instead of employing a proprietary solution, the PS5 uses NVMe storage. Thankfully, there aren’t as many potential configurations as you would find on a PC. Engadget maintains a comprehensive guide to the best SSDs for PS5; in short, your best bet is a high-capacity Gen4 drive with a built-in heatsink. Check out that guide for a full list of gaming SSD recommendations, but for a quick go-to, consider the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX I recommend above. It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Corsair offers 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB versions of the drive. Expect to pay about $110 for the 1TB variant and about $200 for 2TB. For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles and updating your operating system instead. SSD FAQs What size SSD is best? There is no one size fits all rule for SSDs, but we generally recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD if you’re looking to upgrade PC or game console storage, or looking to add an external drive to your toolkit. A 1TB drive will be plenty for most people who need extra storage space for photos, documents and programs. If you’re a hardcore gamer, you may want to invest in even more storage considering many high-profile titles today can take up a ton of space. Is a 256GB SSD better than a 1TB hard drive? The short answer is that it depends on what you need your drive for. In general, SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs, but HDDs are usually cheaper. We recommend springing for an SSD for most use cases today — upgrading a PC, saving important photos and documents, storing games long term, etc. But if you’re focused on getting the most amount of extra space possible (and sticking to a budget), an HDD could be a good option for you. Does bigger SSD mean faster? Getting a bigger SSD doesn’t always translate into a faster drive overall. A bigger SSD will provide a higher storage capacity, which means more space for storing digital files and programs. To understand how fast an SSD will be, you’ll want to look at its read/write speeds: read speeds measure how fast a drive can access information, while write speeds measure how fast the drive can save information. Most SSDs list their approximate read/write speeds in their specs, so be sure to check out those numbers before you make a purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "While Silicon Valley debates whether artificial intelligence has become an overinflated bubble, Salesforce&#x27;s enterprise AI platform quietly added 6,000 new customers in a single quarter — a 48% increase that executives say demonstrates a widening gap between speculative AI hype and deployed enterprise solutions generating measurable returns.Agentforce, the company&#x27;s autonomous AI agent platform, now serves 18,500 enterprise customers, up from 12,500 the prior quarter. Those customers collectively run more than three billion automated workflows monthly and have pushed Salesforce&#x27;s agentic product revenue past $540 million in annual recurring revenue, according to figures the company shared with VentureBeat. The platform has processed over three trillion tokens — the fundamental units that large language models use to understand and generate text — positioning Salesforce as one of the largest consumers of AI compute in the enterprise software market.\"This has been a year of momentum,\" Madhav Thattai, Salesforce&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer for AI, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We crossed over half a billion in ARR for our agentic products, which have been out for a couple of years. And so that&#x27;s pretty remarkable for enterprise software.\"The numbers arrive amid intensifying scrutiny of AI spending across corporate America. Venture capitalists and analysts have questioned whether the billions pouring into AI infrastructure — from data centers to graphics processing units to model development — will ever generate proportionate returns. Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon have committed tens of billions to AI infrastructure, prompting some investors to ask whether the enthusiasm has outpaced the economics.Yet the Salesforce data suggests that at least one segment of the AI market — enterprise workflow automation — is translating investments into concrete business outcomes at a pace that defies the bubble narrative.Why enterprise AI trust has become the defining challenge for CIOs in 2025The distinction between AI experimentation and AI deployment at scale comes down to one word that appeared repeatedly across interviews with Salesforce executives, customers, and independent analysts: trust.Dion Hinchcliffe, who leads the CIO practice at technology research firm The Futurum Group, said the urgency around enterprise AI has reached a fever pitch not seen in previous technology cycles. His firm recently completed a comprehensive analysis of agentic AI platforms that ranked Salesforce slightly ahead of Microsoft as the market leader.\"I&#x27;ve been through revolution after revolution in this business,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this before. In my entire career, I&#x27;ve never seen this level of business focus—boards of directors are directly involved, saying this is existential for the company.\"The pressure flows downward. CIOs who once managed technology as a cost center now field questions directly from board members demanding to know how their companies will avoid being disrupted by AI-native competitors.\"They&#x27;re pushing the CIO hard, asking, &#x27;What are we doing? How do we make sure we&#x27;re not put out of business by the next AI-first company that reimagines what we do?&#x27;\" Hinchcliffe said.But that pressure creates a paradox. Companies want to move fast on AI, yet the very autonomy that makes AI agents valuable also makes them dangerous. An agent that can independently execute workflows, process customer data, and make decisions without human intervention can also make mistakes at machine speed — or worse, be manipulated by bad actors.This is where enterprise AI platforms differentiate themselves from the consumer AI tools that dominate headlines. According to Hinchcliffe, building a production-grade agentic AI system requires hundreds of specialized engineers working on governance, security, testing, and orchestration — infrastructure that most companies cannot afford to build themselves.\"The average enterprise-grade agentic team is 200-plus people working on an agentic platform,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"Salesforce has over 450 people working on agent AI.\"Early in the AI adoption cycle, many CIOs attempted to build their own agent platforms using open-source tools like LangChain. They quickly discovered the complexity exceeded their resources.\"They very quickly realized this problem was much bigger than expected,\" Hinchcliffe explained. \"To deploy agents at scale, you need infrastructure to manage them, develop them, test them, put guardrails on them, and govern them — because you&#x27;re going to have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of long-running processes out there doing work.\"How AI guardrails and security layers separate enterprise platforms from consumer chatbotsThe technical architecture that separates enterprise AI platforms from consumer tools centers on what the industry calls a \"trust layer\" — a set of software systems that monitor, filter, and verify every action an AI agent attempts to take.Hinchcliffe&#x27;s research found that only about half of the agentic AI platforms his firm evaluated included runtime trust verification — the practice of checking every transaction for policy compliance, data toxicity, and security violations as it happens, rather than relying solely on design-time constraints that can be circumvented.\"Salesforce puts every transaction, without exception, through that trust layer,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"That&#x27;s best practice, in our view. If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated system checking policy compliance, toxicity, grounding, security, and privacy on every agentic activity, you can&#x27;t roll it out at scale.\"Sameer Hasan, who serves as Chief Technology and Digital Officer at Williams-Sonoma Inc., said the trust layer proved decisive in his company&#x27;s decision to adopt Agentforce across its portfolio of brands, which includes Pottery Barn, West Elm, and the flagship Williams-Sonoma stores that together serve approximately 20% of the U.S. home furnishings market.\"The area that caused us to make sure—let&#x27;s be slow, let&#x27;s not move too fast, and let this get out of control—is really around security, privacy, and brand reputation,\" Hasan said. \"The minute you start to put this tech in front of customers, there&#x27;s the risk of what could happen if the AI says the wrong thing or does the wrong thing. There&#x27;s plenty of folks out there that are intentionally trying to get the AI to do the wrong thing.\"Hasan noted that while the underlying large language models powering Agentforce — including technology from OpenAI and Anthropic — are broadly available, the enterprise governance infrastructure is not.\"We all have access to that. You don&#x27;t need Agentforce to go build a chatbot,\" Hasan said. \"What Agentforce helped us do more quickly and with more confidence is build something that&#x27;s more enterprise-ready. So there&#x27;s toxicity detection, the way that we handle PII and PII tokenization, data security and creating specific firewalls and separations between the generative tech and the functional tech, so that the AI doesn&#x27;t have the ability to just go comb through all of our customer and order data.\"The trust concerns appear well-founded. The Information reported that among Salesforce&#x27;s own executives, trust in generative AI has actually declined — an acknowledgment that even insiders recognize the technology requires careful deployment.Corporate travel startup Engine deployed an AI agent in 12 days and saved $2 millionFor Engine, a corporate travel platform valued at $2.1 billion following its Series C funding round, the business case for Agentforce crystallized around a specific customer pain point: cancellations.Demetri Salvaggio, Engine&#x27;s Vice President of Customer Experience and Operations, said his team analyzed customer support data and discovered that cancellation requests through chat channels represented a significant volume of contacts — work that required human agents but followed predictable patterns.Engine deployed its first AI agent, named Ava, in just 12 business days. The speed surprised even Salvaggio, though he acknowledged that Engine&#x27;s existing integration with Salesforce&#x27;s broader platform provided a foundation that accelerated implementation.\"We saw success right away,\" Salvaggio said. \"But we went through growing pains, too. Early on, there wasn&#x27;t the observability you&#x27;d want at your fingertips, so we were doing a lot of manual work.\"Those early limitations have since been addressed through Salesforce&#x27;s Agentforce Studio, which now provides real-time analytics showing exactly where AI agents struggle with customer questions — data that allows companies to continuously refine agent behavior.The business results, according to Salvaggio, have been substantial. Engine reports approximately $2 million in annual cost savings attributable to Ava, alongside a customer satisfaction score improvement from 3.7 to 4.2 on a five-point scale — an increase Salvaggio described as \"really cool to see.\"\"Our current numbers show $2 million in cost savings that she&#x27;s able to address for us,\" Salvaggio said. \"We&#x27;ve seen CSAT go up with Ava. We&#x27;ve been able to go from like a 3.7 out of five scale to 4.2. We&#x27;ve had some moments at 85%.\"Perhaps more telling than the cost savings is Engine&#x27;s philosophy around AI deployment. Rather than viewing Agentforce as a headcount-reduction tool, Salvaggio said the company focuses on productivity and customer experience improvements.\"When you hear some companies talk about AI, it&#x27;s all about, &#x27;How do I get rid of all my employees?&#x27;\" Salvaggio said. \"Our approach is different. If we can avoid adding headcount, that&#x27;s a win. But we&#x27;re really focused on how to create a better customer experience.\"Engine has since expanded beyond its initial cancellation use case. The company now operates multiple AI agents — including IT, HR, product, and finance assistants deployed through Slack — that Salvaggio collectively refers to as \"multi-purpose admin\" agents.Williams-Sonoma is using AI agents to recreate the in-store shopping experience onlineWilliams-Sonoma&#x27;s AI deployment illustrates a more ambitious vision: using AI agents not merely to reduce costs but to fundamentally reimagine how customers interact with brands digitally.Hasan described a frustration that anyone who has used e-commerce over the past two decades will recognize. Traditional chatbots feel robotic, impersonal, and limited — good at answering simple questions but incapable of the nuanced guidance a knowledgeable store associate might provide.\"We&#x27;ve all had experiences with chatbots, and more often than not, they&#x27;re not positive,\" Hasan said. \"Historically, chatbot capabilities have been pretty basic. But when customers come to us with a service question, it&#x27;s rarely that simple — &#x27;Where&#x27;s my order?&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s here.&#x27; &#x27;Great, thanks.&#x27; It&#x27;s far more nuanced and complex.\"Williams-Sonoma&#x27;s AI agent, called Olive, goes beyond answering questions to actively engaging customers in conversations about entertaining, cooking, and lifestyle — the same consultative approach the company&#x27;s in-store associates have provided for decades.\"What separates our brands from others in the industry—and certainly from the marketplaces—is that we&#x27;re not just here to sell you a product,\" Hasan said. \"We&#x27;re here to help you, educate you, elevate your life. With Olive, we can connect the dots.\"The agent draws on Williams-Sonoma&#x27;s proprietary recipe database, product expertise, and customer data to provide personalized recommendations. A customer planning a dinner party might receive not just product suggestions but complete menu ideas, cooking techniques, and entertaining tips.Thattai, the Salesforce AI executive, said Williams-Sonoma is in what he describes as the second stage of agentic AI maturity. The first stage involves simple question-and-answer interactions. The second involves agents that actually execute business processes. The third — which he said is the largest untapped opportunity — involves agents working proactively in the background.Critically, Hasan said Williams-Sonoma does not attempt to disguise its AI agents as human. Customers know they&#x27;re interacting with AI.\"We don&#x27;t try to hide it,\" Hasan said. \"We know customers may come in with preconceptions. I&#x27;m sure plenty of people are rolling their eyes thinking, &#x27;I have to deal with this AI thing&#x27;—because their experience with other companies has been that it&#x27;s a cost-cutting maneuver that creates friction.\"The company surveys customers after AI interactions and benchmarks satisfaction against human-assisted interactions. According to Hasan, the AI now matches human benchmarks — a constraint the company refuses to compromise.\"We have a high bar for service—a white-glove customer experience,\" Hasan said. \"AI has to at least maintain that bar. If anything, our goal is to raise it.\"Williams-Sonoma moved from pilot to full production in 28 days, according to Salesforce — a timeline that Thattai said demonstrates how quickly companies can deploy when they build on existing platform infrastructure rather than starting from scratch.The three stages of enterprise AI maturity that determine whether companies see ROIBeyond the headline customer statistics, Thattai outlined a three-stage maturity framework that he said describes how most enterprises approach agentic AI:Stage one involves building simple agents that answer questions — essentially sophisticated chatbots that can access company data to provide accurate, contextual responses. The primary challenge at this stage is ensuring the agent has comprehensive access to relevant information.Stage two involves agents that execute workflows — not just answering \"what time does my flight leave?\" but actually rebooking a flight when a customer asks. Thattai cited Adecco, the recruiting company, as an example of stage-two deployment. The company uses Agentforce to qualify job candidates and match them with roles — a process that involves roughly 30 discrete steps, conditional decisions, and interactions with multiple systems.\"A large language model by itself can&#x27;t execute a process that complex, because some steps are deterministic and need to run with certainty,\" Thattai explained. \"Our hybrid reasoning engine uses LLMs for decision-making and reasoning, while ensuring the deterministic steps execute with precision.\"Stage three — and the one Thattai described as the largest future opportunity — involves agents working proactively in the background without customer initiation. He described a scenario in which a company might have thousands of sales leads sitting in a database, far more than human sales representatives could ever contact individually.\"Most companies don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to reach out and qualify every one of those customers,\" Thattai said. \"But if you use an agent to refine profiles and personalize outreach, you&#x27;re creating incremental opportunities that humans simply don&#x27;t have the capacity for.\"Salesforce edges out Microsoft in analyst rankings of enterprise AI platformsThe Futurum Group&#x27;s recent analysis of agentic AI platforms placed Salesforce at the top of its rankings, slightly ahead of Microsoft. The report evaluated ten major platforms — including offerings from AWS, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, and UiPath — across five dimensions: business value, product innovation, strategic vision, go-to-market execution, and ecosystem alignment.Salesforce scored above 90 (out of 100) across all five categories, placing it in what the firm calls the \"Elite\" zone. Microsoft trailed closely behind, with both companies significantly outpacing competitors.Thattai acknowledged the competitive pressure but argued that Salesforce&#x27;s existing position in customer relationship management provides structural advantages that pure-play AI companies cannot easily replicate.\"The richest and most critical data a company has — data about their customers — lives within Salesforce,\" Thattai said. \"Most of our large customers use us for multiple functions: sales, service, and marketing. That complete view of the customer is central to running any business.\"The platform advantage extends beyond data. Salesforce&#x27;s existing workflow infrastructure means that AI agents can immediately access business processes that have already been defined and refined — a head start that requires years for competitors to match.\"Salesforce is not just a place where critical data is put, which it is, but it&#x27;s also where work is performed,\" Thattai said. \"The process by which a business runs happens in this application — how a sales process is managed, how a marketing process is managed, how a customer service process is managed.\"Why analysts say 2026 will be the real year of AI agents in the enterpriseDespite the momentum, both Salesforce executives and independent analysts cautioned that enterprise AI remains in early innings.Hinchcliffe pushed back against the notion that 2025 was \"the year of agents,\" a phrase that circulated widely at the beginning of the year.\"This was not the year of agents,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"This was the year of finding out how ready they were, learning the platforms, and discovering where they weren&#x27;t mature yet. The biggest complaint we heard was that there&#x27;s no easy way to manage them. Once companies got all these agents running, they realized: I have to do lifecycle management. I have agents running on old versions, but their processes aren&#x27;t finished. How do I migrate them?\"He predicted 2026 has \"a much more likely chance of being the year of agents,\" though added that the \"biggest year of agents\" is \"probably going to be the year after that.\"The Futurum Group&#x27;s analysis forecasts the AI platform market growing from $127 billion in 2024 to $440 billion by 2029 — a compound annual growth rate that dwarfs most enterprise software categories.For companies still on the sidelines, Salvaggio offered pointed advice based on Engine&#x27;s early-adopter experience.\"Don&#x27;t take the fast-follower strategy with this technology,\" he said. \"It feels like it&#x27;s changing every week. There&#x27;s a differentiation period coming — if it hasn&#x27;t started already — and companies that waited are going to fall behind those that moved early.\"He warned that institutional knowledge about AI deployment is becoming a competitive asset in itself — expertise that cannot be quickly acquired through outside consultants.\"Companies need to start building AI expertise into their employee base,\" Salvaggio said. \"You can&#x27;t outsource all of this — you need that institutional knowledge within your organization.\"Thattai struck a similarly forward-looking note, drawing parallels to previous platform shifts.\"Think about the wave of mobile technology—apps that created entirely new ways of interacting with companies,\" he said. \"You&#x27;re going to see that happen with agentic technology. The difference is it will span every channel — voice, chat, mobile, web, text — all tied together by a personalized conversational experience.\"The question for enterprises is no longer whether AI agents will transform customer and employee experiences. The data from Salesforce&#x27;s customer base suggests that transformation is already underway, generating measurable returns for early adopters willing to invest in platform infrastructure rather than waiting for a theoretical bubble to burst.\"I feel incredibly confident that point solutions in each of those areas are not the path to getting to an agentic enterprise,\" Thattai said. \"The platform approach that we&#x27;ve taken to unlock all of this data in this context is really the way that customers are going to get value.\"",

Salesforce&#x27;s existing workflow infrastructure means that AI agents can immediately access business processes that have already been defined and refined — a head start that requires years for competitors to match.\"Salesforce is not just a place where critical data is put, which it is, but it&#x27;s also where work is performed,\" Thattai said. \"The process by which a business runs happens in this application — how a sales process is managed, how a marketing process is managed, how a customer service process is managed.\"Why analysts say 2026 will be the real year of AI agents in the enterpriseDespite the momentum, both Salesforce executives and independent analysts cautioned that enterprise AI remains in early innings.Hinchcliffe pushed back against the notion that 2025 was \"the year of agents,\" a phrase that circulated widely at the beginning of the year.\"This was not the year of agents,\" Hinchcliffe said. \"This was the year of finding out how ready they were, learning the platforms, and discovering where they weren&#x27;t mature yet. The biggest complaint we heard was that there&#x27;s no easy way to manage them. Once companies got all these agents running, they realized: I have to do lifecycle management. I have agents running on old versions, but their processes aren&#x27;t finished. How do I migrate them?\"He predicted 2026 has \"a much more likely chance of being the year of agents,\" though added that the \"biggest year of agents\" is \"probably going to be the year after that.\"The Futurum Group&#x27;s analysis forecasts the AI platform market growing from $127 billion in 2024 to $440 billion by 2029 — a compound annual growth rate that dwarfs most enterprise software categories.For companies still on the sidelines, Salvaggio offered pointed advice based on Engine&#x27;s early-adopter experience.\"Don&#x27;t take the fast-follower strategy with this technology,\" he said. \"It feels like it&#x27;s changing every week. There&#x27;s a differentiation period coming — if it hasn&#x27;t started already — and companies that waited are going to fall behind those that moved early.\"He warned that institutional knowledge about AI deployment is becoming a competitive asset in itself — expertise that cannot be quickly acquired through outside consultants.\"Companies need to start building AI expertise into their employee base,\" Salvaggio said. \"You can&#x27;t outsource all of this — you need that institutional knowledge within your organization.\"Thattai struck a similarly forward-looking note, drawing parallels to previous platform shifts.\"Think about the wave of mobile technology—apps that created entirely new ways of interacting with companies,\" he said. \"You&#x27;re going to see that happen with agentic technology. The difference is it will span every channel — voice, chat, mobile, web, text — all tied together by a personalized conversational experience.\"The question for enterprises is no longer whether AI agents will transform customer and employee experiences. The data from Salesforce&#x27;s customer base suggests that transformation is already underway, generating measurable returns for early adopters willing to invest in platform infrastructure rather than waiting for a theoretical bubble to burst.\"I feel incredibly confident that point solutions in each of those areas are not the path to getting to an agentic enterprise,\" Thattai said. \"The platform approach that we&#x27;ve taken to unlock all of this data in this context is really the way that customers are going to get value.\"",

          "standfirst": "The Nintendo Switch 2 supports a wide range of controllers, from Nintendo’s own Pro Controller to many Bluetooth gamepads you might already have. Whether you’re setting up your new console for the first time or adding extra controllers for multiplayer games, pairing them is simple as long as you know where to look. Here’s how to connect the Switch 2 Pro Controller, how to sync additional Bluetooth controllers and what to do if something doesn’t pair correctly.Before you start: What you’ll needTo pair any controller with the Switch 2 you’ll need the console powered on and updated to the latest system software. Navigate to System Settings, System then System Update to check. It also helps to have the controller charged, since some models need enough battery to begin pairing.On the Switch 2, all controller settings reside in the Controllers & Sensors section of System Settings. You can pair up to four controllers depending on the game and the controller type.How to pair the Switch 2 Pro ControllerNintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller is the simplest device to connect, and it can be paired in two different ways: wired and wireless. If you’re setting it up for the first time, the wired method is the fastest and most reliable.To pair the Switch 2 Pro Controller using a USB cable:Connect the Pro Controller to the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable.Wake the console and open the Controllers menu from the Home screen.The console will automatically detect the controller and pair it.Once the controller is paired, you can unplug the cable and continue using it wirelessly. This method ensures an instant connection and is useful if the controller has low battery.To pair wirelessly:Turn on the Switch 2 and navigate to System Settings, Controllers & Sensors then Change Grip/Order.Press and hold the small Sync button on top of the Pro Controller until the indicator lights begin flashing.The Switch 2 will detect the controller and confirm the pairing.How to pair other Bluetooth controllers to Switch 2The Switch 2 supports a wide range of Bluetooth controllers, including many gamepads designed for PC, Android and iOS devices. Pairing these controllers uses a similar process, but you’ll start by putting the controller into Bluetooth pairing mode.Each controller handles this differently. On most models, you’ll hold a dedicated sync button or press a combination of buttons until lights begin flashing. If you’re not sure which buttons to press, check the controller’s manual.On the Switch 2, navigate to the Home Menu and select Controllers then Change Grip/Order. This page is always used for wireless pairing. The console will search for available Bluetooth devices as soon as it opens.Once your controller appears on the screen, select it to finish the pairing process. The lights on the controller should stop blinking and settle into an assigned player slot. Some controllers may prompt you to confirm the button layout or adjust settings after pairing.The Switch 2 can use up to four wireless controllers at once. For local multiplayer games, each controller will automatically be assigned a player number once connected.Troubleshooting pairing issuesIf your controller doesn’t appear in the pairing menu, make sure Bluetooth is enabled on the Switch 2 by navigating to System Settings then Controllers & Sensors. It’s also worth restarting the controller and checking that it has enough battery to stay in pairing mode. Moving closer to the console can help reduce interference as well. If you’re trying to connect a controller that supports multiple device profiles, verify that it’s set to Nintendo Switch mode or a standard Bluetooth gamepad mode.With Pro Controllers, a wired connection usually solves pairing problems. Plug the controller into the Switch 2 using a USB-C cable and allow it to sync before trying wireless mode again.Reconnecting paired controllersOnce you’ve paired a controller, reconnecting it is as simple as pressing any button. The Switch 2 will wake and recognize it automatically as long as the controller is still linked to the console. If you pair the controller with another device later, you may need to repeat the pairing process.Pairing controllers with the Switch 2 is quick once you know where the settings live. The Pro Controller offers the most seamless experience, especially if you start with a wired connection, but the console’s Bluetooth support gives you plenty of flexibility for multiplayer games or different play styles.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-pair-controllers-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000126.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It might be hard to believe, but foldable phones have already been around for the better part of a decade. Granted, the first one I saw back in 2019 — which actually predates Samsung's Galaxy Fold — was a cobbled-together mess. But since then, phone makers have been steadily iterating and tweaking their designs, and this year, manufacturers have finally addressed all the major issues about foldable phones except one: price.Let’s go back to the OG Fold. Even though it was chunky and heavy, had a tiny exterior display and suffered from a hinge that let too much detritus inside (which is probably how The Verge’s review unit got wrecked), it still showed so much promise. It was a true multitasker — a phone that could turn into a small tablet at a moment's notice. What's not to like?This scene would have sent shivers down my spine in previous years, but thanks to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold isn't bothered. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetFrom there, Samsung upgraded its foldables with water resistance and S Pen support on the Z Fold 3, followed by eliminating the gap between the two halves of a closed Z Fold 5. And as competition grew from OnePlus and Google (not to mention all the Chinese rivals like Oppo, Xiaomi and others), we saw design and software improvement across the category . In 2025, two phones in particular brought major upgrades to foldables as a whole. Even though its shape didn't change much from its predecessor, Google managed to get the Pixel 10 Pro Fold an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance — finally putting protection for both dirt and liquid in the same foldable for the first time. Now, for all the folks out there with regular phones, that might not sound like a big deal. But on devices with complicated hinges where you really don't want random garbage getting inside, that's a massive relief and a big improvement to the handset's general usability. If you only look at their dimensions, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (right) and an S25 Ultra (left).Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMeanwhile, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung achieved what may be an even bigger accomplishment by creating a foldable phone that was essentially the same size and weight as a traditional glass brick handset — with a massive 8-inch interior display no less. In fact, if you compared the Z Fold 7 to Samsung's other flagship — the S25 Ultra — the fold is actually a touch lighter (7.58 ounces vs 7.69 ounces) and practically just as thin (8.9mm vs 8.2mm). That's huge because one of the biggest issues with previous generations of foldables was excess bulk and heft, to the point where often I had to wear a belt just so my pants wouldn't sag when carrying one around. Unfortunately, there isn't a phone maker that has put both of these advancements into a single gadget just yet. But this is still a big deal, and based on how things are trending, I'm sure that won't be the case for long.What about the crease, you say? Yes, even the latest and greatest foldables still have a small depression that runs down the screen where the phone bends in half. Let me be clear: that's not really an issue. Sure, it would be nice if it weren't there, but getting mad about the crease is kind of like being annoyed at a convertible car that has some extra panel gaps because it has a retractable roof. Not only is the crease basically invisible when you are looking at it head-on (which is the vast majority of the time), in reality, people don't touch the dead center of their phone's display all that often — especially on a screen the size of a small tablet.The Z Fold 7 has made bulky foldables a thing of the past while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold shows how these phones don't need to be afraid of dirt anymore. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetReally, the one thing the makers of big foldables haven't figured out is how to make them affordable. OnePlus sort of came close in 2023 with the Open, which cost $1,500 after rebates that included trading in literally any phone (even broken ones). In fact, things are actually kind of going backwards. The launch price of the Z Fold 7 ($2,000) is $200 more than what the Z Fold 5 debuted at just a couple of years ago. Even with high prices, I've started seeing more and more foldable phones in the wild than ever before and the data backs up my sentiment. Sales of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are up 50 percent compared to the previous generation while global foldable phone sales reached a new high in Q3 of this year, and I'm willing to bet that there are millions of others out there who would be interested in them — if only they didn't cost so much.

          "standfirst": "A tight budget does not mean you have to settle for a slow or outdated laptop. Many affordable models today offer solid performance for work, classes and everyday browsing, and some even pack in extras like bright displays or long battery life. Whether you need something for school, travel or streaming, there are plenty of budget laptops that deliver more value than you might expect.Since the options can be overwhelming, we tested a wide range of devices to find the best budget laptops that offer dependable performance without stretching your wallet. Table of contents The best cheap laptops of 2026 What to look for in a budget laptop A note about refurbished laptops The best cheap laptops of 2026 What to look for in a budget laptop First, we at Engadget consider anything under $1,000 to be “budget” in the laptop space. The reason for this is twofold: even the most affordable flagship laptops typically start at $1,000 or more, and if you go dramatically lower than that (say, $500 or less), that’s where you’ll really start to see compromises in performance. You’ll typically find the best cheap laptops striking a good balance between power and price in the $500 to $1,000 range. But in this guide, we’ll cover top picks at a wide range of prices — there are a number of excellent options on the low and high end of the budget spectrum. Arguably the biggest thing to look for in a cheap laptop is build quality and a decent spec sheet. You might be able to find configuration options with the latest generation CPU chipsets, or you may have to go for one that has a slightly older processor. We recommend looking for models with solid state drive (SSD) storage instead of a traditional hard drive, as SSDs provide faster performance. And if you can find a PC with the latest internals, it’s worth the investment. However, going with a CPU that’s just one generation behind likely won’t make a noticeable difference in performance. Along with processors, you should also consider the amount of memory and storage you need in a daily driver. For the former, we recommend laptops with at least 8GB of RAM; anything with less than that will have a hard time multitasking and managing all those web browsing tabs. The latter is a bit more personal: how much onboard storage you need really depends on how many apps, files, photos, documents and more you will save locally. As a general rule of thumb, try to go for a laptop that has at least a 256GB SSD (this only goes for macOS and Windows machines, as Chromebooks are a bit different). That should give you enough space for programs and files, plus room for future operating system updates. And if you need a machine for light productivity or Android emulation, some laptops even support Android apps natively, which can add extra versatility. After determining the best performance you can get while sticking to your budget, it’s also worth examining a few different design aspects. We recommend a laptop with an IPS display for better viewing angles and color accuracy, though premium models with OLED displays are becoming more common and can offer deeper blacks and vibrant colors. Pay attention to port selection, too — many budget models offer plenty of ports, while higher-end ones tend to prioritize minimalism with fewer connections. If connectivity matters to you, look for options with USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and an audio jack. And speaking of practical features, keep an eye on GPU performance if you're shopping for a budget-friendly gaming laptop. While integrated graphics are fine for casual users, a dedicated GPU will improve gaming and creative workloads. We also recommend checking the refresh rate of the screen, as a higher rate will make a noticeable difference in both games and scrolling-heavy apps. A note about refurbished laptops Refurbished laptops are another option to consider if you need a new machine and don’t want to spend a ton of money. Buying refurbished tech can be tricky if you’re unfamiliar with a brand’s or merchant’s policies surrounding what they classify as “refurbished.” But it’s not impossible — for laptops, we recommend going directly to the manufacturer for refurbished devices. Apple, Dell and Microsoft all have official refurbishment processes that their devices go through before they’re put back on the market that verifies the machines work properly and are in good condition. Third-party retailers like Amazon and Walmart also have their own refurbishment programs for laptops and other gadgets as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Presented by EdgeVerveArtificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to change the way enterprises operate. For years, the focus was on assistants, systems that could surface information, summarize documents, or streamline repetitive tasks. While valuable, these technological assistants were reactive: they waited for human prompts and provided limited support within narrow boundaries.Today, a new chapter is unfolding. Agentic AI, whose systems are capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step orchestration, represents a significant evolution. These systems don’t just assist, they act. They evaluate context, weigh outcomes and autonomously initiate actions, orchestrating complex workflows across functions. They adapt dynamically and collaborate with other agents in ways that are beginning to reshape enterprise operations at large. For leaders, this shift carries both opportunity and responsibility. The potential is immense, but so are the governance, trust and design challenges that come with giving AI systems greater autonomy. Enterprises must be able to monitor and override any actions taken by the agentic AI systems.Shift from assistance to autonomyTraditional AI assistants primarily respond to queries and perform isolated tasks. They are helpful but constrained. Agentic AI pushes further: multiple agents can collaborate, exchange context and manage workflows end-to-end.Imagine a procurement workflow. An assistant can pull vendor data or draft a purchase order. An agentic system, however, can review demand forecasts, evaluate vendor risk, check compliance policies, negotiate terms and finalize transactions. It does this all while coordinating across global business departments, including finance, operations and compliance.This shift from narrow support to autonomous orchestration is the defining leap of the next era of enterprise AI. It is not about replacing humans but about embedding intelligence into the very fabric of organizational workflows.Rethink enterprise workflows The goal of every enterprise department is focused on efficiency, scale and standardization. But agentic AI challenges enterprises to think differently. Instead of designing workflows step by step and inserting automation, organizations now need to completely reimagine and architect intelligent ecosystems for orchestrating processes, adapting to evolving business needs, and enabling seamless collaboration between humans and agents.That requires new thinking. Which decisions should remain human-led, and which can be delegated? How do you ensure agents access the correct data without overstepping boundaries? What happens when agents from finance, HR and supply chain must coordinate autonomously?The design of workflows is no longer about linear handoffs; it is about orchestrated ecosystems. Enterprises that get this right can achieve speed and agility that traditional automation cannot match.Accelerate agentic AI-led transformation with a unified platformIn this environment, unified platforms become critical. Without them, enterprises risk a proliferation of disconnected agents working at cross-purposes. A unified approach provides the guardrails with shared knowledge graphs, consistent policy frameworks and a single orchestration layer that ensures interoperability across business functions.This platform-based approach not only reduces complexity but also enables scale. Enterprises don’t want dozens of fragmented AI projects that stall in the pilot stages. They want enterprise-grade systems where agents can collaborate securely and consistently across the enterprise.Unified platforms simplify outcome monitoring and strengthen governance —both critical as systems become increasingly autonomous.Build trust and accountabilityAs AI systems act with greater independence, the stakes rise. An agent who makes flawed decisions in customer service may frustrate a client. An agent that mishandles a compliance process could expose the enterprise to regulatory risk.That’s why trust and accountability must be designed into agentic AI from the start. Governance is not an afterthought; it is a foundation. Leaders need clear policies defining the scope of agentic autonomy, transparent logging of decisions, evaluating and monitoring agents and escalation mechanisms when human oversight is required.Equally important is cultural trust. Employees must believe these systems are partners, not threats. This calls for change management, training, and communication that positions agentic AI as augmenting human capability rather than replacing it.Measure business value earlyOne of the most common pitfalls in enterprise AI adoption is the gap between promising pilots and at-scale results. Studies show that a significant percentage of AI projects never make it past experimentation. Agentic AI cannot afford to fall into this trap.Enterprises must measure business value early and continuously. This includes efficiency gains, cost reductions, error avoidance and even intangible benefits like faster decision-making or improved compliance. Success will be defined by automation coverage across processes, reductions in manual intervention and the ability to deliver new services at speed and scale.When designed responsibly, agentic AI can deliver exponential improvements. A procurement cycle reduced from weeks to hours, or a compliance review automated at scale, can fundamentally alter enterprise performance.Preparing for the futureThe rise of agentic AI does not mean handing over control to machines or codes. Instead, it marks the next phase of enterprise transformation, where humans and agents operate side by side in orchestrated systems.Leaders should start by piloting agentic systems in well-defined domains with clear governance models. From there, scaling across the enterprise requires investment in unified platforms, robust policy frameworks, and a culture that embraces intelligent automation as a partner in value creation.The enterprises that succeed will be those that approach agentic AI not as another tool, but as a strategic shift. Just as ERP and cloud once redefined operations, agentic AI is poised to do the same, reshaping workflows, governance, and the very way decisions are made.Agentic AI is moving the enterprise conversation from assistance to autonomy. That change comes with objective complexity, but also with extraordinary promise. The foundation for success lies in unified platforms that enable enterprises to orchestrate with intelligence, govern with trust, and scale with confidence. The journey is just beginning.

          "standfirst": "João Freitas is GM and VP of engineering for AI and automation at PagerDutyAs AI use continues to evolve in large organizations, leaders are increasingly seeking the next development that will yield major ROI. The latest wave of this ongoing trend is the adoption of AI agents. However, as with any new technology, organizations must ensure they adopt AI agents in a responsible way that allows them to facilitate both speed and security. More than half of organizations have already deployed AI agents to some extent, with more expecting to follow suit in the next two years. But many early adopters are now reevaluating their approach. Four-in-10 tech leaders regret not establishing a stronger governance foundation from the start, which suggests they adopted AI rapidly, but with margin to improve on policies, rules and best practices designed to ensure the responsible, ethical and legal development and use of AI.As AI adoption accelerates, organizations must find the right balance between their exposure risk and the implementation of guardrails to ensure AI use is secure.Where do AI agents create potential risks?There are three principal areas of consideration for safer AI adoption.The first is shadow AI, when employees use unauthorized AI tools without express permission, bypassing approved tools and processes. IT should create necessary processes for experimentation and innovation to introduce more efficient ways of working with AI. While shadow AI has existed as long as AI tools themselves, AI agent autonomy makes it easier for unsanctioned tools to operate outside the purview of IT, which can introduce fresh security risks.Secondly, organizations must close gaps in AI ownership and accountability to prepare for incidents or processes gone wrong. The strength of AI agents lies in their autonomy. However, if agents act in unexpected ways, teams must be able to determine who is responsible for addressing any issues.The third risk arises when there is a lack of explainability for actions AI agents have taken. AI agents are goal-oriented, but how they accomplish their goals can be unclear. AI agents must have explainable logic underlying their actions so that engineers can trace and, if needed, roll back actions that may cause issues with existing systems.While none of these risks should delay adoption, they will help organizations better ensure their security.The three guidelines for responsible AI agent adoptionOnce organizations have identified the risks AI agents can pose, they must implement guidelines and guardrails to ensure safe usage. By following these three steps, organizations can minimize these risks.1: Make human oversight the default AI agency continues to evolve at a fast pace. However, we still need human oversight when AI agents are given the capacity to act, make decisions and pursue a goal that may impact key systems. A human should be in the loop by default, especially for business-critical use cases and systems. The teams that use AI must understand the actions it may take and where they may need to intervene. Start conservatively and, over time, increase the level of agency given to AI agents.In conjunction, operations teams, engineers and security professionals must understand the role they play in supervising AI agents’ workflows. Each agent should be assigned a specific human owner for clearly defined oversight and accountability. Organizations must also allow any human to flag or override an AI agent’s behavior when an action has a negative outcome.When considering tasks for AI agents, organizations should understand that, while traditional automation is good at handling repetitive, rule-based processes with structured data inputs, AI agents can handle much more complex tasks and adapt to new information in a more autonomous way. This makes them an appealing solution for all sorts of tasks. But as AI agents are deployed, organizations should control what actions the agents can take, particularly in the early stages of a project. Thus, teams working with AI agents should have approval paths in place for high-impact actions to ensure agent scope does not extend beyond expected use cases, minimizing risk to the wider system.2: Bake in security The introduction of new tools should not expose a system to fresh security risks. Organizations should consider agentic platforms that comply with high security standards and are validated by enterprise-grade certifications such as SOC2, FedRAMP or equivalent. Further, AI agents should not be allowed free rein across an organization’s systems. At a minimum, the permissions and security scope of an AI agent must be aligned with the scope of the owner, and any tools added to the agent should not allow for extended permissions. Limiting AI agent access to a system based on their role will also ensure deployment runs smoothly. Keeping complete logs of every action taken by an AI agent can also help engineers understand what happened in the event of an incident and trace back the problem.3: Make outputs explainable AI use in an organization must never be a black box. The reasoning behind any action must be illustrated so that any engineer who tries to access it can understand the context the agent used for decision-making and access the traces that led to those actions.Inputs and outputs for every action should be logged and accessible. This will help organizations establish a firm overview of the logic underlying an AI agent’s actions, providing significant value in the event anything goes wrong.Security underscores AI agents’ successAI agents offer a huge opportunity for organizations to accelerate and improve their existing processes. However, if they do not prioritize security and strong governance, they could expose themselves to new risks. As AI agents become more common, organizations must ensure they have systems in place to measure how they perform and the ability to take action when they create problems.Read more from our guest writers.

The news of Bruno's sudden resignation was unexpected. His tenure was marked by a decline in ULA's market share as rival SpaceX competed for and won ever-larger US government launch contracts. More recently, Bruno oversaw the successful debut of ULA's Vulcan rocket, followed by struggles to ramp up the new rocket's launch cadence. Bruno had a 30-year career as an engineer and general manager for Lockheed Martin's ballistic missile programs before taking over as president and CEO of United Launch Alliance in August 2014. He arrived as SpaceX started making inroads with its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket, and ULA's leading position in the US launch market looked to be in doubt.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "For the better part of two months last year, most of us had no idea how serious the problems were with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft docked at the International Space Station. A safety advisory panel found this uncertainty also filtered through NASA's workforce. On its first Crew Test Flight, Boeing's Starliner delivered NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station in June 2024. They were the first people to fly to space on a Starliner spacecraft after more than a decade of development and setbacks. The astronauts expected to stay at the ISS for one or two weeks, but ended up remaining in orbit for nine months after NASA officials determined it was too risky to return them to Earth in the Boeing-built crew capsule. Wilmore and Williams flew back to Earth last March on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The Starliner capsule was beset by problems with its maneuvering thrusters and pernicious helium leaks on its 27-hour trip from the launch pad to the ISS. For a short time, Starliner commander Wilmore lost his ability to control the movements of his spacecraft as it moved in for docking at the station in June 2024. Engineers determined that some of the thrusters were overheating and eventually recovered most of their function, allowing Starliner to dock with the ISS.Read full article Comments",

A vampire period piece, perhaps? Or maybe a reboot of 1983's Blue Thunder or British 1960s spy series The Prisoner? Instead, Nolan chose to adapt one of the greatest epic sagas in history: Homer's Odyssey. At long last, Universal has released the first official trailer for Nolan's The Odyssey, starring Matt Damon as the wandering Ithacan king. Frankly, it looks appropriately epic. Most of us read some version of The Odyssey in high school, so we're familiar with the story: Odysseus, legendary Greek king of Ithaca, begins the long journey home after 10 years of fighting in the Trojan War. (We actually catch a glimpse of the famous Trojan horse in the trailer.) But the journey does not go smoothly, as Odysseus and his men encounter the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and an enchantress named Circe, among other obstacles. Meanwhile, his long-suffering wife Penelope is warding off hundreds of suitors eager to usurp Odysseus' position. It's difficult to underestimate the tremendous influence Homer's epic has had on global culture. Nolan himself recalled seeing the Odyssey performed as a school play when he was just 5 or 6 years old. \"I remember the Sirens and him being strapped to the mast and things like that,\" he recently told Empire. \"I think it's in all of us, really. And when you start to break down the text and adapt it, you find that all of these other films—and all the films I've worked on—you know, they're all from the Odyssey. It's foundational.\"Read full article Comments",

The move comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid legal scrutiny, the Interior is blaming the decisions on a classified report from the Department of Defense. The second Trump administration announced its animosity toward offshore wind power literally on day one, issuing an executive order on inauguration day that called for a temporary halt to issuing permits for new projects pending a re-evaluation. Earlier this month, however, a judge vacated that executive order, noting that the government has shown no indication that it was even attempting to start the re-evaluation it said was needed. But a number of projects have gone through the entire permitting process, and construction has started. Before today, the administration had attempted to stop these in an erratic, halting manner. Empire Wind, an 800 MW farm being built off New York, was stopped by the Department of the Interior, which alleged that it had been rushed through permitting. That hold was lifted following lobbying and negotiations by New York and the project developer Orsted, and the Department of the Interior never revealed why it changed its mind. When the Interior Department blocked a second Orsted project, Revolution Wind offshore of southern New England, the company took the government to court and won a ruling that let it continue construction.Read full article Comments",

When the Biden-era FCC reinstated Obama-era net neutrality rules in 2024, Carr alleged that President Biden \"took the extraordinary step to pressure the FCC—an independent agency that is designed to operate outside undue political influence from the Executive Branch.\" As evidence, Carr pointed to a 2021 executive order in which Biden called on agency heads to \"consider using their authorities\" for various types of pro-competitive policies, including the adoption of net neutrality rules. Carr said that President Obama similarly \"pressure[d] an independent agency into grabbing power that the Legislative Branch never said it had delegated.\" Obama's intrusion into this independence, according to Carr, came in November 2014 when the president released a two-minute video urging the agency to implement net neutrality rules and reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.Read full article Comments",

It started with a fire at a substation in the city on Saturday afternoon, causing a blackout that at times affected as much as a third of the city, leaving more than 130,000 homes without power. Among the city's affected critical systems were the traffic lights, which paralyzed Waymo's fleet of robotaxis, stopping them in their tracks and clogging traffic. Any recent visitor to San Francisco can't help but notice the profusion of sensor-festooned autonomous vehicles on the roads, especially the all-white Jaguar I-Paces that belong to Waymo. The robotaxi company has more than 800 AVs in its Bay Area fleet; that can feel like a conservative estimate when you see five or six at a time—invariably with no occupants—within a block. The cars navigate the city, combining high-resolution maps with inputs from lidar, optical, and other sensors on the upfitted Jags. The cars drive conservatively, but they can get confused in edge cases—earlier this month, Waymo issued a recall to fix a problem in which its robotaxis would illegally pass stopped school buses.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Caroline Muller looks at clouds differently than most people. Where others may see puffy marshmallows, wispy cotton candy or thunderous gray objects storming overhead, Muller sees fluids flowing through the sky. She visualizes how air rises and falls, warms and cools, and spirals and swirls to form clouds and create storms. But the urgency with which Muller, a climate scientist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, considers such atmospheric puzzles has surged in recent years. As our planet swelters with global warming, storms are becoming more intense, sometimes dumping two or even three times more rain than expected. Such was the case in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, in March 2025: Almost half the city’s yearly average rainfall fell in less than 12 hours, causing deadly floods. Atmospheric scientists have long used computer simulations to track how the dynamics of air and moisture might produce varieties of storms. But existing models hadn’t fully explained the emergence of these fiercer storms. A roughly 200-year-old theory describes how warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air: an extra 7 percent for every degree Celsius of warming. But in models and weather observations, climate scientists have seen rainfall events far exceeding this expected increase. And those storms can lead to severe flooding when heavy rain falls on already saturated soils or follows humid heatwaves.Read full article Comments",
