Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of AirTags for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we've seen for these Bluetooth trackers. If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you're on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product. AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag's location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups.

          "title": "Palona goes vertical, launching Vision, Workflow features: 4 key lessons for AI builders",
          "standfirst": "Building an enterprise AI company on a \"foundation of shifting sand\" is the central challenge for founders today, according to the leadership at Palona AI. Today, the Palo Alto-based startup—led by former Google and Meta engineering veterans—is making a decisive vertical push into the restaurant and hospitality space with today&#x27;s launch of Palona Vision and Palona Workflow. The new offerings transform the company’s multimodal agent suite into a real-time operating system for restaurant operations — spanning cameras, calls, conversations, and coordinated task execution.The news marks a strategic pivot from the company’s debut in early 2025, when it first emerged with $10 million in seed funding to build emotionally intelligent sales agents for broad direct-to-consumer enterprises. Now, by narrowing its focus to a \"multimodal native\" approach for restaurants, Palona is providing a blueprint for AI builders on how to move beyond \"thin wrappers\" to build deep systems that solve high-stakes physical world problems.“You’re building a company on top of a foundation that is sand—not quicksand, but shifting sand,” said co-founder and CTO Tim Howes, referring to the instability of today’s LLM ecosystem. “So we built an orchestration layer that lets us swap models on performance, fluency, and cost.”VentureBeat spoke with Howes and co-founder and CEO Maria Zhang in person recently at — where else? — a restaurant in NYC about the technical challenges and hard lessons learned from their launch, growth, and pivot.The New Offering: Vision and Workflow as a ‘Digital GM’For the end user—the restaurant owner or operator—Palona’s latest release is designed to function as an automated \"best operations manager\" that never sleeps.Palona Vision uses in-store security cameras to analyze operational signals — such as queue lengths, table turnover, prep bottlenecks, and cleanliness — without requiring any new hardware.It monitors front-of-house metrics like queue lengths, table turns, and cleanliness, while simultaneously identifying back-of-house issues like prep slowdowns or station setup errors.Palona Workflow complements this by automating multi-step operational processes. This includes managing catering orders, opening and closing checklists, and food prep fulfillment. By correlating video signals from Vision with Point-of-Sale (POS) data and staffing levels, Workflow ensures consistent execution across multiple locations. “Palona Vision is like giving every location a digital GM,” said Shaz Khan, founder of Tono Pizzeria + Cheesesteaks, in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “It flags issues before they escalate and saves me hours every week.”Going Vertical: Lessons in Domain ExpertisePalona’s journey began with a star-studded roster. CEO Zhang previously served as VP of Engineering at Google and CTO of Tinder, while Co-founder Howes is the co-inventor of LDAP and a former Netscape CTO. Despite this pedigree, the team’s first year was a lesson in the necessity of focus.Initially, Palona served fashion and electronics brands, creating \"wizard\" and \"surfer dude\" personalities to handle sales. However, the team quickly realized that the restaurant industry presented a unique, trillion-dollar opportunity that was \"surprisingly recession-proof\" but \"gobsmacked\" by operational inefficiency.\"Advice to startup founders: don&#x27;t go multi-industry,\" Zhang warned. By verticalizing, Palona moved from being a \"thin\" chat layer to building a \"multi-sensory information pipeline\" that processes vision, voice, and text in tandem.That clarity of focus opened access to proprietary training data (like prep playbooks and call transcripts) while avoiding generic data scraping. 1. Building on ‘Shifting Sand’To accommodate the reality of enterprise AI deployments in 2025 — with new, improved models coming out on a nearly weekly basis — Palona developed a patent-pending orchestration layer.Rather than being \"bundled\" with a single provider like OpenAI or Google, Palona’s architecture allows them to swap models on a dime based on performance and cost. They use a mix of proprietary and open-source models, including Gemini for computer vision benchmarks and specific language models for Spanish or Chinese fluency. For builders, the message is clear: Never let your product&#x27;s core value be a single-vendor dependency.2. From Words to ‘World Models’The launch of Palona Vision represents a shift from understanding words to understanding the physical reality of a kitchen. While many developers struggle to stitch separate APIs together, Palona’s new vision model transforms existing in-store cameras into operational assistants.The system identifies \"cause and effect\" in real-time—recognizing if a pizza is undercooked by its \"pale beige\" color or alerting a manager if a display case is empty. \"In words, physics don&#x27;t matter,\" Zhang explained. \"But in reality, I drop the phone, it always goes down... we want to really figure out what&#x27;s going on in this world of restaurants\".3. The ‘Muffin’ Solution: Custom Memory ArchitectureOne of the most significant technical hurdles Palona faced was memory management. In a restaurant context, memory is the difference between a frustrating interaction and a \"magical\" one where the agent remembers a diner’s \"usual\" order.The team initially utilized an unspecified open-source tool, but found it produced errors 30% of the time. \"I think advisory developers always turn off memory [on consumer AI products], because that will guarantee to mess everything up,\" Zhang cautioned.To solve this, Palona built Muffin, a proprietary memory management system named as a nod to web \"cookies\". Unlike standard vector-based approaches that struggle with structured data, Muffin is architected to handle four distinct layers:Structured Data: Stable facts like delivery addresses or allergy information.Slow-changing Dimensions: Loyalty preferences and favorite items.Transient and Seasonal Memories: Adapting to shifts like preferring cold drinks in July versus hot cocoa in winter.Regional Context: Defaults like time zones or language preferences.The lesson for builders: If the best available tool isn&#x27;t good enough for your specific vertical, you must be willing to build your own.4. Reliability through ‘GRACE’In a kitchen, an AI error isn&#x27;t just a typo; it’s a wasted order or a safety risk. A recent incident at Stefanina’s Pizzeria in Missouri, where an AI hallucinated fake deals during a dinner rush, highlights how quickly brand trust can evaporate when safeguards are absent.To prevent such chaos, Palona’s engineers follow its internal GRACE framework:Guardrails: Hard limits on agent behavior to prevent unapproved promotions.Red Teaming: Proactive attempts to \"break\" the AI and identify potential hallucination triggers.App Sec: Lock down APIs and third-party integrations with TLS, tokenization, and attack prevention systems.Compliance: Grounding every response in verified, vetted menu data to ensure accuracy.Escalation: Routing complex interactions to a human manager before a guest receives misinformation.This reliability is verified through massive simulation. \"We simulated a million ways to order pizza,\" Zhang said, using one AI to act as a customer and another to take the order, measuring accuracy to eliminate hallucinations.The Bottom LineWith the launch of Vision and Workflow, Palona is betting that the future of enterprise AI isn&#x27;t in broad assistants, but in specialized \"operating systems\" that can see, hear, and think within a specific domain. In contrast to general-purpose AI agents, Palona’s system is designed to execute restaurant workflows, not just respond to queries — it&#x27;s capable of remembering customers, hearing them order their \"usual,\" and monitoring the restaurant operations to ensure they deliver that customer the food according to their internal processes and guidelines, flagging whenever something goes wrong or crucially, is about to go wrong.For Zhang, the goal is to let human operators focus on their craft: \"If you&#x27;ve got that delicious food nailed... we’ll tell you what to do.\"",

On Thursday, the company announced changes to iOS in Japan to comply with the nation's Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA). The tighter regulations for Apple and Google, which overlap with Europe's, took effect today. Users in the US and elsewhere won't see any of these changes.Apple's changes in iOS 26.2 in Japan revolve around alternative app stores, payments outside the App Store and browser choice. The company worked with Japanese regulators on new protections for increased security risks.The company calls this set of safeguards Notarization. It involves an authorization process for alternative app stores and child-safety protocols. Third-party marketplaces will need to undergo a baseline security review. This uses a combination of human and automated checks to block malware and other threats.Naturally, Apple cautions that Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Store's reviews. \"The App Store — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store's high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love,\" the company wrote.To state the obvious, the App Store is a booming business for the iPhone maker.

Users in Japan will see new browser and search engine choice screens. They'll also find default controls for navigation apps and app stores. Finally, developers can now offer browsers that use alternative engines other than Apple's WebKit.Apple's announcement comes a day after Google detailed its compliance with the MSCA.

          "standfirst": "If you're struggling to find your next binge-watch, you can't go wrong with anime. For the holidays, you can save on a Crunchyroll subscription, giving you access to its vast library of anime series to watch. Through December 29, you can sign up for an annual Fan subscription for $67, down from the usual $80, or a Mega Fan subscription for $100, down from $120. While both the Fan and Mega Fan plans are ad-free, you do get some different benefits depending on which you decide to pay for. Fan subscribers get full access to Crunchyroll's library, new episodes \"shortly after they air in Japan\" and five percent off select purchases in the Crunchyroll Store. Mega Fan subscribers get all those benefits, plus the ability to stream on four devices at the same time, download HD quality episodes and movies to view offline, play games from the Crunchyroll Game Vault and receive 10 percent off select products in the Crunchyroll Store. Notably missing from either subscription is access to Crunchyroll's new Manga service, but unless you're specifically looking for reading material, you'll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll's video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You'll find long-running series like One Piece and newer hits like Spy X Family, alongside hundreds of more niche series. Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was acquired by Sony, it's been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already produced poor results. It's hard to beat Crunchyroll's library, though, and for as little as $65, you'll get more than your money's worth.

Notably missing from either subscription is access to Crunchyroll's new Manga service, but unless you're specifically looking for reading material, you'll get plenty of entertainment out of Crunchyroll's video library. Outside of Netflix, which produces and licenses its own growing collection of anime, Crunchyroll is the de facto place to watch Japanese animation in the US. You'll find long-running series like One Piece and newer hits like Spy X Family, alongside hundreds of more niche series. Crunchyroll has its issues, of course. Since the streaming service was acquired by Sony, it's been particularly interested in using generative AI to subtitle shows, which has already produced poor results. It's hard to beat Crunchyroll's library, though, and for as little as $65, you'll get more than your money's worth.

          "standfirst": "Amazon just introduced a new feature for Alexa+ called Greetings. This lets Alexa+ answer the doorbell and converse with visitors, which certainly sounds futuristic in a \"gated community as dystopia\" kind of way. There are several caveats here. First of all, it only works with certain newer Ring video doorbell models. Customers also have to pony up for a Ring Premium Plan and have access to the Alexa+ early access build. It's available in the US and Canada and only in English. If you meet those criteria, this could be a fairly useful little feature. Amazon says it \"transforms your Ring doorbell into an intelligent assistant capable of determining who's at your door, understanding what they need and responding conversationally.\" The company promises that the tool operates whether people or home or out doing errands. How does this work? It's an AI algorithm that \"determines who's there based on what they're wearing, holding or their actions.\" It will use \"visual context, any information the visitor shares and the instructions it's been given to help manage interactions on your behalf.\" Amazon says that it can, for instance, distinguish if a person is wearing a delivery uniform and tell them to leave the package at the back door. Most of my delivery drivers don't come to the door in full uniforms because it's winter and that would be ridiculous. I don't even expect that during the summer. In other words, this is modern AI and mistakes will happen. The company gives other examples of how this could be used, like gathering messages from friends who stop by and telling door-to-door salespeople to (politely) bug off. Amazon also says Alexa+ will be able to direct visitors to water and snacks that have previously been laid out. Finally, there's a way to avoid those pesky cute kids on Halloween while still providing them with treats. Everything can be reviewed later on via the Ring app, which should provide context as to who has been hanging around the porch. Alexa+ Greetings are rolling out today. For the uninitiated, Alexa+ is Amazon's updated chatbot. It's more conversational than the old Alexa, which could be useful or annoying depending on what you use it for. I use Alexa primarily as an alarm, so I don't necessarily want a gabfest.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/alexa-can-now-answer-your-ring-doorbell-and-talk-to-people-162712774.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has begun accepting submissions from third-party developers for their apps to be accessible directly in ChatGPT, and has launched a new App Directory (don&#x27;t call it a \"store\"!) that can be opened from the ChatGPT sidebar and at the URL chatgpt.com/apps.This means the 800 million+ users of OpenAI&#x27;s hit chatbot can search for, discover and begin using newly approved third-party apps immediately. Once installed, apps can be triggered during conversations by mentioning them by name (using @) or selecting them from the tools menu.The third-party app submission process officially went live last night, December 17, as OpenAI announced in a blog post and on its developer account on X, though the company notes it will be reviewing all new third-party app submissions before approving them for listing in the App Directory, and making them available to ChatGPT users, to ensure they comply with the company&#x27;s public guidelines. Apps that pass OpenAI’s review process will begin rolling out to users starting early 2026.For those enterprises who want to get in on the action with their own ChatGPT apps, OpenAI said it will host a public webinar “Build Hour” event for third-party developers on January 21, where OpenAI engineers will walk through how to build, submit, and design apps for ChatGPT, using real-world examples and taking questions.App Directory vs. GPT StoreThis whole effort marks the start of a broader developer ecosystem beyond the small set of curated partners OpenAI launched its Apps standard development kit (SDK) earlier this fall, and seems to be fulfilling some of the hype that ensued back when OpenAI debuted its \"GPT Store\" back in early 2024, nearly two years ago. However, despite the pledge of revenue sharing that OpenAI made back then, it hasn&#x27;t since provided many updates on the GPT Store, nor have we heard much from GPT builders about making substantive revenue from it. But while those custom, user-generated GPTs were limited primarily to text-based experiences, the new ChatGPT App Directory and SDK features allow for a far more interactive experience including user accessible buttons, maps, multi-views, sliders, shaders, and other interaction modalities. The GPT Store also still remains available now.Monetization, restrictions, and review processIn this early phase, ChatGPT apps may link out to external websites to complete purchases for physical goods only. Selling digital goods, subscriptions, or in‑app services isn&#x27;t yet allowed, though OpenAI says it is exploring additional monetization options over time.All apps must:Comply with OpenAI’s usage policiesBe suitable for general audiences, including teensInclude a clear privacy policy and support contactAvoid advertising, deceptive behavior, or prohibited commerce categoriesDevelopers submit apps through the OpenAI Developer Platform, where they can track review status. Only one version of an app can be under review at a time.What this means for developers and usersOpenAI first introduced the Apps SDK at its DevDay conference in October, positioning it as a way to build “apps inside of ChatGPT.” CEO Sam Altman described the vision as enabling “a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized.”Built on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) developed by rival Anthropic, the Apps SDK lets developers connect external services, fetch real-time context, trigger actions, and render UI directly inside ChatGPT. Until now, ChatGPT apps were limited to a list of seven pilot partners including:Booking.comCanvaCourseraExpediaFigmaSpotifyZillowThat list has since expanded to dozens of new apps, including popular software like Adobe PhotoShop (and Acrobat and Express), Github, Replit, Gmail and Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, Mailchimp, Stripe, and many more. And with general submissions now open, any verified developer—from solo builders to large enterprises—can build and submit apps for ChatGPT, provided they meet OpenAI’s quality, safety, and privacy standards.For users, the change means ChatGPT can now act as a hub for specialized tools and workflows. Apps can extend conversations by pulling in live data, rendering interactive interfaces, or taking actions on a user’s behalf—like designing a presentation, searching for housing, or interacting with an external service—without leaving the chat.Apps can appear in several formats, including:Inline cards or carousels inside the conversationFullscreen views for immersive tasks like maps or slide decksPicture‑in‑picture modes for video, tutorials, or live sessionsThe goal, OpenAI says, is to keep everything feeling conversational while adding real utility.How ChatGPT is handling Apps dataOne of the biggest open questions around ChatGPT apps is how user data is handled when third‑party apps are involved. Based on OpenAI’s documentation and guidelines, here’s what is clear—and what remains unanswered.What OpenAI has stated clearly:When a user connects to an app, ChatGPT discloses what types of data may be shared with the third party and surfaces the app’s privacy policy before connection.Third‑party developers are responsible for how their apps handle data once received.Apps must minimize data collection, requesting only what is necessary to perform a specific task.Apps are prohibited from requesting full chat transcripts, broad contextual data “just in case,” or sensitive personal data.Any action that sends data outside ChatGPT or modifies external systems must be clearly labeled and require user confirmation.Apps must not reconstruct or infer a user’s full chat history and must avoid undisclosed tracking or profiling.What OpenAI has not clarified publicly:Whether OpenAI itself retains or logs the data passed between ChatGPT and third‑party apps.Whether data exchanged with apps can be used for model training or internal analytics.How long, if at all, OpenAI stores metadata or interaction traces related to app usage.As a result, while OpenAI emphasizes strong guardrails for developers and transparency for users, it has not explicitly detailed OpenAI’s own role as a data processor in app interactions. That ambiguity has already drawn scrutiny and remains an open issue as the app ecosystem expands.The bigger pictureWith app submissions now open and an App Directory live, ChatGPT is no longer just a conversational AI—it’s becoming a distribution platform for AI‑native software.Developers get access to a massive built‑in audience, while users gain tools that can be discovered and used at the moment they’re needed, directly inside a conversation.OpenAI describes this as “just the beginning.” But with the infrastructure now in place, the shift from chatbot to app ecosystem is officially underway.",

Selling digital goods, subscriptions, or in‑app services isn&#x27;t yet allowed, though OpenAI says it is exploring additional monetization options over time.All apps must:Comply with OpenAI’s usage policiesBe suitable for general audiences, including teensInclude a clear privacy policy and support contactAvoid advertising, deceptive behavior, or prohibited commerce categoriesDevelopers submit apps through the OpenAI Developer Platform, where they can track review status. Only one version of an app can be under review at a time.What this means for developers and usersOpenAI first introduced the Apps SDK at its DevDay conference in October, positioning it as a way to build “apps inside of ChatGPT.” CEO Sam Altman described the vision as enabling “a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized.”Built on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) developed by rival Anthropic, the Apps SDK lets developers connect external services, fetch real-time context, trigger actions, and render UI directly inside ChatGPT. Until now, ChatGPT apps were limited to a list of seven pilot partners including:Booking.comCanvaCourseraExpediaFigmaSpotifyZillowThat list has since expanded to dozens of new apps, including popular software like Adobe PhotoShop (and Acrobat and Express), Github, Replit, Gmail and Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, Mailchimp, Stripe, and many more. And with general submissions now open, any verified developer—from solo builders to large enterprises—can build and submit apps for ChatGPT, provided they meet OpenAI’s quality, safety, and privacy standards.For users, the change means ChatGPT can now act as a hub for specialized tools and workflows. Apps can extend conversations by pulling in live data, rendering interactive interfaces, or taking actions on a user’s behalf—like designing a presentation, searching for housing, or interacting with an external service—without leaving the chat.Apps can appear in several formats, including:Inline cards or carousels inside the conversationFullscreen views for immersive tasks like maps or slide decksPicture‑in‑picture modes for video, tutorials, or live sessionsThe goal, OpenAI says, is to keep everything feeling conversational while adding real utility.How ChatGPT is handling Apps dataOne of the biggest open questions around ChatGPT apps is how user data is handled when third‑party apps are involved. Based on OpenAI’s documentation and guidelines, here’s what is clear—and what remains unanswered.What OpenAI has stated clearly:When a user connects to an app, ChatGPT discloses what types of data may be shared with the third party and surfaces the app’s privacy policy before connection.Third‑party developers are responsible for how their apps handle data once received.Apps must minimize data collection, requesting only what is necessary to perform a specific task.Apps are prohibited from requesting full chat transcripts, broad contextual data “just in case,” or sensitive personal data.Any action that sends data outside ChatGPT or modifies external systems must be clearly labeled and require user confirmation.Apps must not reconstruct or infer a user’s full chat history and must avoid undisclosed tracking or profiling.What OpenAI has not clarified publicly:Whether OpenAI itself retains or logs the data passed between ChatGPT and third‑party apps.Whether data exchanged with apps can be used for model training or internal analytics.How long, if at all, OpenAI stores metadata or interaction traces related to app usage.As a result, while OpenAI emphasizes strong guardrails for developers and transparency for users, it has not explicitly detailed OpenAI’s own role as a data processor in app interactions. That ambiguity has already drawn scrutiny and remains an open issue as the app ecosystem expands.The bigger pictureWith app submissions now open and an App Directory live, ChatGPT is no longer just a conversational AI—it’s becoming a distribution platform for AI‑native software.Developers get access to a massive built‑in audience, while users gain tools that can be discovered and used at the moment they’re needed, directly inside a conversation.OpenAI describes this as “just the beginning.” But with the infrastructure now in place, the shift from chatbot to app ecosystem is officially underway.",

          "standfirst": "If you're like me, it's probably been a hot minute since you’ve used or even thought of Meetup. Predating both Facebook and Twitter, the website, which was designed to help people organize in-person events, has changed hands a handful of times in recent years. In 2017, founder Scott Heiferman sold it to WeWork, which offloaded it a few years later before declaring bankruptcy in 2023. As of 2024, Bending Spoons, the Italian tech company that's probably best known for buying Evernote in 2022, has been running Meetup. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the platform has seen something of resurgence. As of late 2025, Gen Z and young Millennials make up 40 percent of Meetup's active user base and represent its most engaged group of users. This year, the app has also seen a 20 percent year-over-year increase in new registrations. Going into 2026, Bending Spoons is hoping to build on that momentum with a redesign of Meetup's mobile app. The new interface, which starts rolling out today, brings the Android and iOS app inline with Meetup's recently redesigned website. Across the application, users can expect updated fonts, new more colorful icons and better spacing. The goal of the redesign is to make the app \"vibrant, fun and more modern than before,\" says Chiara Vivaldi, Meetup's product lead. She adds the redesigned app retains all the key features found in the previous version, while making those easier to find. For instance, users can access their profile and groups directly from the homepage of the app. Beyond making Meetup feel more modern, Bending Spoon is using the redesign to cement the groundwork for a series of improvements it plans to roll out in the coming months. Soon, Meetup users will be able to see a breakdown of the people who have signed up for an event.Bending SpoonsAccording to Vivaldi, one major priority is to give people, particularly women, more confidence to attend the events that are listed on Meetup. When you navigate to an event page in the new app, you'll see a broad gender and age breakdown of the users who have signed up to be there. Additionally, new and richer user profiles allow people to get a better sense of who exactly they might meet if they decide to go. Bending Spoons is also introducing a new Super Organizer badge it plans to award to the platform's top event planners. It's designed to signal to users that the person who put together the event takes community building seriously. Taken together, Vivaldi says these features are designed to reduce the friction of attending events where you might not know anyone, and they're something the company plans to build on in the future. At the same time, Bending Spoons plans to make it easier for organizers to use Meetup. Starting early next year, the company will unify Meetup's two disparate apps — right now, the company maintains separate ones for members and organizers. Vivaldi says organizers can expect the unified app to include all of the features they depend on, alongside a handful of enhancements. For instance, Vivaldi’s team is working to make QR-based ticketing the norm for check-ins and attendance tracking. She says the move to a single app is informed by the fact that 75 percent of Meetup's organizers got their start as a member. \"[Organizers] are part of the community. They want to be in the action, and so having them within the same app is conducive to that. They can jump into conversations, look at other events, making it all feel a bit more organic,\" Vivaldi said. In the meantime, if it’s been since you’ve used Meetup, you can download the redesigned app from the App and Google Play stores.

If you've been thinking about upgrading your computer, you can save right now on Apple's Mac mini M4. The desktop is down to $479, which is 20 percent off its usual price and the same low price we saw during Black Friday. Apple released the Mac mini M4 in late 2024 and we were impressed with how something so small could be so powerful. We gave it a 90 in our review, thanks to features like its speed and standard 16GB of RAM. The — currently — $479 base model also comes with 256GB of SSD. We were also happy to see it had front-facing USB-C and headphone ports. If you really want to go all out for someone's gift (or for yourself) then you can buy one of the Mac mini M4's higher memory or storage options. You can pick up the Mac Mini M4 with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799 — a 14 percent discount. Meanwhile, the 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD model is 11 percent off, dropping to $890 from $999.

OpenAI also noted in a help document that \"connector\" apps like Google Drive are now simply called \"apps.\" The new apps section (on iOS, Android and web) is divided into Feature, Lifestyle and Productivity categories, letting you connect to commonly used apps and sites like Booking.com, Spotify and Dropbox. To use an app, simply click on it, hit \"Connect\" then authorize the app to access ChatGPT. With that done, you can then start a chat related to that app. In the case of Dropbox, for instance, you'll be able to \"gather insights, prepare briefs and summarize reports or internal documents,\" according to the description. Once connected, any app can be accessed by doing an @ mention of it. A new addition that came along with the store is an Apple Music app that, like Spotify, helps users find music, create playlists and manage their libraries through a chat interface. Another is DoorDash, which lets you transform recipes, meal planning and staples into \"an actionable shopping cart.\" Along with the app directory, OpenAI is now allowing developers to submit apps for review and publication in ChatGPT according to the company's app submission guidelines. It also published resources to help developers build such apps, including best practices, open-source example apps, an open-sourced UI library for chat-native interfaces and a step-by-step quickstart guide. That's on top of the software developer kit (SDK) that OpenAI introduced in October. OpenAI noted that for now, developers can only monetize apps by linking out from the ChatGPT app to the native app or website — but the company is exploring internal monetization options as well. Privacy was also emphasized, with companies required to provide \"clear\" policies. The new feature is a big part of Sam Altman's promises to make ChatGPT more versatile with the addition of custom \"GPT\" bots. \"Over time, we want apps in ChatGPT to feel like a natural extension of the conversation, helping people move from ideas to action, while building a thriving ecosystem for developers,\" the company wrote.

          "standfirst": "There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it). Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

Case in point: Apple's AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September this year, are back down to $199. That's an all-time-low price and better than the price it was during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple's H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget's review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget's Billy Steele wrote in his review, \"Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.\" In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you'll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you'll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

Table of contents What you need to know about AirPods Best AirPods for 2026 Best AirPods specs comparison chart Other AirPods we tested What you need to know about AirPods When it comes to Apple’s earbuds and headphones, there are several things you’ll want to keep in mind before making your final decision. First, the standard AirPods are the open-design earbuds with no tip that allow some environmental noise to come into your ears at all times. The Apple AirPods Pro are the model with tips that completely close off your ear canal, which enables features like more powerful noise cancellation and the hearing test. Lastly, the Apple AirPods Max are the company’s over-ear noise-canceling headphones preferred by audiophiles, and currently the company’s only option for wireless headphones at all that aren’t made by Beats. There are a few features that are available across all models as they’ve become inherent to the AirPods experience. First, you can expect connectivity perks like Automatic Switching between Apple devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This means that a pair of AirPods will automatically change to your phone when you get a call while you’re listening to music on a MacBook or laptop, for example. It’s functionally similar to multipoint Bluetooth, but the feature isn’t limited to two devices like most earbuds and headphones. Second, hands-free access to Siri is the default, allowing you to ask the assistant for help without touching your AirPods. And lastly, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is available across the entire lineup, even on the most affordable version and the new AirPods, including AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation.

This more expensive version adds Adaptive Audio, Transparency mode, Conversation Awareness and a wireless charging case. The ANC isn’t as powerful as the AirPods Pro 2, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 doesn’t completely seal off your ears. The noise-canceling performance is definitely useful though, working best with constant, low-frequency annoyances like fans and white noise machines. Lastly, you won’t get access to Apple’s hearing test and hearing aid features, partially due to the fact that the AirPods 4 with ANC doesn’t seal off your ears, which would affect accuracy and effectiveness.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-airpods-100041810.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. ESPN Unlimited bundle — $30/month with Disney+ and Hulu for free for one year: Sports fans can sign up for the new ESPB Unlimited bundle at the standard $30-per-month rate, but for a limited time, you can get Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) included in that price for free. The trio bundle would typically cost you $36 per month, so overall, you're saving $6 per month for one year, for a total of $72 in savings. Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Crunchyroll — $67 for one year ($13 off): Anime fans can get one year of Crunchyroll access for less right now. The Fan tier is down to $67 for the year, while the Mega Fan tier is on sale for $100 for one year. Both tiers give you ad-free access to the streaming service, but you'll get offline access and up to four simultaneous streams with the Mega Fan option. Note that this deal does not include access to Crunchyroll Manga. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon's own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "standfirst": "There’s a good chance you own a couple of gadgets that support wireless charging now, be it your iPhone or Android phone, wireless earbuds or smartwatch. Multi-device wireless chargers can help power them all up in one place, without the need for a bunch of cords messing up your space. There are dozens of these accessories out there today, and we’ve tested a bunch of the most popular models. You’ll find out top picks below for the best wireless charging pads, plus some advice on how to choose the right one for your needs. Table of contents Best wireless charging pads Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device? How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs Wireless charging speed and performance Best wireless charging pads Do wireless charging pads work with any phone or device? The short answer is no, but the long and more detailed answer starts with it depends. Regular old wireless charging pucks should work with any device that’s compatible with the same wireless charging standard that the charger supports. Smartphones and other mobile devices that support wireless charging nowadays are likely to support the Qi standard, so double check that your phone or gadget fits that bill and it should work with any Qi wireless charging pad (all of our top picks fall into this category). When it comes to multi-device chargers, things can get a little tricky. Rather than starting your search looking for the most universally adaptable accessory, consider the devices you have and aspire to own in the future. If you’re an iPhone user with an Apple Watch, you may want to look for a wireless charger that has a Watch pad built in. Ditto if you’re a Samsung phone owner and use a Galaxy Watch. Some earbuds support wireless charging, but you’ll only need an open pad or space on your multi-device charger where you can sit the earbuds in their case down for a power-up. Those with iPhone 12s and newer Apple smartphones can take advantage of MagSafe chargers, which magnetically attach to their handsets. Android devices don’t support Apple’s proprietary MagSafe technology, but you can buy a magnetic adapter for pretty cheap that will allow your Samsung or Pixel phone to work with MagSafe multi-device chargers. You’ll also need that to get full Qi2 goodness with newer Android phones like the Galaxy S25 series, which are “Qi2 ready,” but since they do not have magnets built in, aren’t precisely Qi2 compliant. How to pick the best wireless charging pad for your needs Even without a charging cable to worry about, you’re probably buying a multi-device wireless charger with one location in mind. It might sit on your nightstand or on your desk. Not everyone buys a charger just for themselves, though; you might want to use one as a shared station for you and a partner. If the charger will sit on your nightstand, you’ll likely want a compact, stable unit that won’t swallow all your free space or tumble to the floor (and if it does fall, one with enough durability to survive). Some may prefer a lay-flat design if your phone screen has a tendency to keep you awake at night. Others might use their phone as their alarm clock, in which case you may want a stand that keeps the screen within reach and eyeshot. This is also the preferred design if you use Standby Mode on iPhones. A vertical orientation may be best for a charger that lives on your desk so you can more easily check notifications throughout the day. Will the charger sit on a low table? Horizontal charger pads may make it easier to grab your devices in a hurry. Travel chargers should fold up or otherwise protect the pads while they’re in your bag. And, yes, aesthetics count. You may want something pretty if it’s likely to sit in a posh room where guests will see it. For vehicles, consider a wireless car charger if you frequently need to top off your device on the go. These chargers combine convenience with functionality, ensuring your phone stays powered while you’re navigating and taking calls at the same time. We also heavily recommend a magnetic charger so there’s less of a chance your phone will go flying into the passenger’s seat the next time you hit a pothole. Wireless charging speed and performance It’s no secret that wireless charging is slower than wired, and powering multiple devices adds a new wrinkle. As these chargers often have to support a wide range of hardware, you’ll have to forget about the fastest, device-specific options from brands like Google, OnePlus and Samsung. Today, most wireless chargers come in at 15W for phones. The latest Qi2 standard can get you up to 25W of power with a compatible smartphone. These speeds are improving bit by bit, but they're still not quite as fast as wired charging. It’s rare that you’ll find a truly slow-as-molasses example, mind you. Even some of the most affordable options we’ve seen will recharge your phone at a reasonable 7.5W or 10W, and the 5W for other devices like wireless earbuds is more than enough. If you’re only docking overnight or while you work, speed won’t make a huge difference. Just be sure that whatever you buy is powerful enough for a phone in a case. Some chargers may also include an AC adapter in the box. If not, make sure you’re using one with the right power level to get the fastest charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. For the holiday season, plenty of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This holiday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months. NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another holiday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "content": "With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. For the holiday season, plenty of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time.

          "standfirst": "When it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Amazon. And that rationale isn’t limited to consumers: Many local districts shopping for supplies with public funds apply the same logic. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) published a study earlier this month (via The American Prospect) that illustrates the cost of that bargain. It suggests that Amazon’s “dynamic pricing” has led many schools and other localities to overpay for supplies.Public schools and local governments have historically bought supplies by soliciting competitive bids from local suppliers. Those vendors then respond with fixed price lists, delivery timelines and other terms. This competition — all out in the open, part of the public record — encourages low prices and transparency.On the surface, ordering from Amazon appears to offer competition, too. After all, the platform includes third-party vendors fighting for your dollars. But turning taxpayer funds over to Amazon’s algorithms isn’t quite that simple. That’s because the platform’s “dynamic pricing” (algorithmically driven real-time changes) is inherently opaque.According to the report, Amazon’s contracts with public entities don’t include fixed price lists. Instead, they include language built around swings. “This contract has a dynamic pricing structure in which the price for items listed on the online digital marketplace is driven by the market,” Amazon’s contract with Utah reads. “This contract will not need to be amended when prices fluctuate.”Below are some examples of wild price discrepancies for these districts. All of ILSR’s examples are from localities buying supplies from Amazon Business with public funds in 2023.A City of Boulder, CO employee ordered a 12-pack of Sharpie markers from Amazon Business for $8.99. On the same day, a Denver Public Schools worker ordered the same markers for $28.63.Amazon charged Clark County, WA, $146,000 for 610 computer monitors. On another day, that same order would have cost $24,000 less.Pittsburgh Schools bought two cases of Kleenex for $57.99 each. On the same day, Denver Schools paid $36.91 for a single case.On a single August day, Denver Schools placed two separate orders for bulk cases of dry-erase markers. One cost $114.52. The other was $149.07.In March 2023, Denver Schools paid $15.39 for a Swingline stapler (sold by Amazon). A few days later, the same school system paid $61.87 for the same product (sold by a third-party seller).Even in that last example, ILSR says Amazon’s algorithms are the culprit. “It might be tempting to blame the seller for putting a $62 price tag on a stapler or the employee for not noticing the cost,” the nonprofit argues. “But that overlooks Amazon’s pivotal role in the transaction — and the profit it makes. Amazon’s algorithms steer shoppers’ attention, selecting featured products and organizing search results. The platform routinely prompts users to ‘buy it again,’ even when the price has jumped. For busy public school employees, it’s all too easy to simply click the buy button, under the assumption that Amazon is surfacing the best option.”Amazon CEO Andy JassyNoah Berger via Getty ImagesOne portion of the study looked at repeat orders for 2,500 “high-frequency items.” (These included Amazon-brand copy paper, Elmer’s glue, BIC pens, Lysol cleaning wipes and Crayola crayons.) In total, the jurisdictions in the study spent $3 million on those items. But based on the lowest prices Amazon charged during that period, they would have paid only $2.5 million. Across those same items, one school district could have saved 17 percent (about $1 million) if it consistently received Amazon’s lowest prices.What would fair market value have been for those items? Well, it’s hard to say because the algorithms are steering pricing silently in the background. A more thorough study that included the same items, bought exclusively through the traditional procurement method, would tell us much more. And recent history has taught us that trusting Big Tech’s algorithms to serve the public good (rather than its own bottom line) is a fool’s errand.In at least some cases, the practice routes public funds away from local vendors and toward overseas ones — and, of course, Amazon itself. In Berkeley County, WV, the school district spent $1.3 million on Amazon Business in 2023. What portion went to sellers in the state? A measly $142.On top of all of that, the practice has snuffed out many of the smaller vendors that traditionally competed for these contracts. “The disappearance of these small and mid-sized businesses weakens local economies and tax bases,” the report concludes. “And it leaves governments increasingly dependent on Amazon, paving the way for the kind of monopoly control that ensures higher prices, poorer service, and less innovation.”In a statement sent to The Guardian, Amazon disputed the study’s conclusions. “Pricing research is notoriously difficult to conduct accurately and typically lacks reliable methodology, including cherry-picked product selections, mismatched product comparisons and comparing in-stock items with products out-of-stock at competitors,”ILSR’s report drew in spending data from 128 local governments (including cities, counties and school districts) and 122 state agencies. It also gathered contract documents and interviewed public officials, procurement experts and vendors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/study-links-amazons-algorithmic-pricing-with-erratic-inflated-costs-for-school-districts-202047988.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Gemini 3 Flash arrives with reduced costs and latency — a powerful combo for enterprises",
          "standfirst": "Enterprises can now harness the power of a large language model that&#x27;s near that of the state-of-the-art Google’s Gemini 3 Pro, but at a fraction of the cost and with increased speed, thanks to the newly released Gemini 3 Flash.The model joins the flagship Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and Gemini Agent, all of which were announced and released last month.Gemini 3 Flash, now available on Gemini Enterprise, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, AI Studio, and on preview in Vertex AI, processes information in near real-time and helps build quick, responsive agentic applications. The company said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Flash “builds on the model series that developers and enterprises already love, optimized for high-frequency workflows that demand speed, without sacrificing quality.The model is also the default for AI Mode on Google Search and the Gemini application. Tulsee Doshi, senior director, product management on the Gemini team, said in a separate blog post that the model “demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence.”“Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows,” Doshi said. “It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.”Early adoption by specialized firms proves the model&#x27;s reliability in high-stakes fields. Harvey, an AI platform for law firms, reported a 7% jump in reasoning on their internal &#x27;BigLaw Bench,&#x27; while Resemble AI discovered that Gemini 3 Flash could process complex forensic data for deepfake detection 4x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro. These aren&#x27;t just speed gains; they are enabling &#x27;near real-time&#x27; workflows that were previously impossible.More efficient at a lower costEnterprise AI builders have become more aware of the cost of running AI models, especially as they try to convince stakeholders to put more budget into agentic workflows that run on expensive models. Organizations have turned to smaller or distilled models, focusing on open models or other research and prompting techniques to help manage bloated AI costs.For enterprises, the biggest value proposition for Gemini 3 Flash is that it offers the same level of advanced multimodal capabilities, such as complex video analysis and data extraction, as its larger Gemini counterparts, but is far faster and cheaper. While Google’s internal materials highlight a 3x speed increase over the 2.5 Pro series, data from independent benchmarking firm Artificial Analysis adds a layer of crucial nuance. In the latter organization&#x27;s pre-release testing, Gemini 3 Flash Preview recorded a raw throughput of 218 output tokens per second. This makes it 22% slower than the previous &#x27;non-reasoning&#x27; Gemini 2.5 Flash, but it is still significantly faster than rivals including OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.1 high (125 t/s) and DeepSeek V3.2 reasoning (30 t/s).Most notably, Artificial Analysis crowned Gemini 3 Flash as the new leader in their AA-Omniscience knowledge benchmark, where it achieved the highest knowledge accuracy of any model tested to date. However, this intelligence comes with a &#x27;reasoning tax&#x27;: the model more than doubles its token usage compared to the 2.5 Flash series when tackling complex indexes. This high token density is offset by Google&#x27;s aggressive pricing: when accessing through the Gemini API, Gemini 3 Flash costs $0.50 per 1 million input tokens, compared to $1.25/1M input tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and $3/1M output tokens, compared to $ 10/1 M output tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro. This allows Gemini 3 Flash to claim the title of the most cost-efficient model for its intelligence tier, despite being one of the most &#x27;talkative&#x27; models in terms of raw token volume.

Google said the model “is able to modulate how much it thinks,” so that it uses more thinking and therefore more tokens for more complex tasks than for quick prompts. The company noted Gemini 3 Flash uses 30% fewer tokens than Gemini 2.5 Pro. To balance this new reasoning power with strict corporate latency requirements, Google has introduced a &#x27;Thinking Level&#x27; parameter. Developers can toggle between &#x27;Low&#x27;—to minimize cost and latency for simple chat tasks—and &#x27;High&#x27;—to maximize reasoning depth for complex data extraction.

When combined with the Batch API’s 50% discount, the total cost of ownership for a Gemini-powered agent drops significantly below the threshold of competing frontier models“Gemini 3 Flash delivers exceptional performance on coding and agentic tasks combined with a lower price point, allowing teams to deploy sophisticated reasoning costs across high-volume processes without hitting barriers,” Google said. By offering a model that delivers strong multimodal performance at a more affordable price, Google is making the case that enterprises concerned with controlling their AI spend should choose its models, especially Gemini 3 Flash. Strong benchmark performance But how does Gemini 3 Flash stack up against other models in terms of its performance? Doshi said the model achieved a score of 78% on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark testing for coding agents, outperforming both the preceding Gemini 2.5 family and the newer Gemini 3 Pro itself!For enterprises, this means high-volume software maintenance and bug-fixing tasks can now be offloaded to a model that is both faster and cheaper than previous flagship models, without a degradation in code quality.The model also performed strongly on other benchmarks, scoring 81.2% on the MMMU Pro benchmark, comparable to Gemini 3 Pro. While most Flash type models are explicitly optimized for short, quick tasks like generating code, Google claims Gemini 3 Flash’s performance “in reasoning, tool use and multimodal capabilities is ideal for developers looking to do more complex video analysis, data extraction and visual Q&A, which means it can enable more intelligent applications — like in-game assistants or A/B test experiments — that demand both quick answers and deep reasoning.”First impressions from early usersSo far, early users have been largely impressed with the model, particularly its benchmark performance.

By making Pro-level reasoning the new baseline, Google is setting a trap for slower incumbents. The integration into platforms like Google Antigravity suggests that Google isn&#x27;t just selling a model; it&#x27;s selling the infrastructure for the autonomous enterprise. As developers hit the ground running with 3x faster speeds and a 90% discount on context caching, the \"Gemini-first\" strategy becomes a compelling financial argument. In the high-velocity race for AI dominance, Gemini 3 Flash may be the model that finally turns \"vibe coding\" from an experimental hobby into a production-ready reality.",
          "content": "Enterprises can now harness the power of a large language model that&#x27;s near that of the state-of-the-art Google’s Gemini 3 Pro, but at a fraction of the cost and with increased speed, thanks to the newly released Gemini 3 Flash.The model joins the flagship Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and Gemini Agent, all of which were announced and released last month.Gemini 3 Flash, now available on Gemini Enterprise, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, AI Studio, and on preview in Vertex AI, processes information in near real-time and helps build quick, responsive agentic applications. The company said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Flash “builds on the model series that developers and enterprises already love, optimized for high-frequency workflows that demand speed, without sacrificing quality.The model is also the default for AI Mode on Google Search and the Gemini application. Tulsee Doshi, senior director, product management on the Gemini team, said in a separate blog post that the model “demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence.”“Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows,” Doshi said. “It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.”Early adoption by specialized firms proves the model&#x27;s reliability in high-stakes fields. Harvey, an AI platform for law firms, reported a 7% jump in reasoning on their internal &#x27;BigLaw Bench,&#x27; while Resemble AI discovered that Gemini 3 Flash could process complex forensic data for deepfake detection 4x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro. These aren&#x27;t just speed gains; they are enabling &#x27;near real-time&#x27; workflows that were previously impossible.More efficient at a lower costEnterprise AI builders have become more aware of the cost of running AI models, especially as they try to convince stakeholders to put more budget into agentic workflows that run on expensive models. Organizations have turned to smaller or distilled models, focusing on open models or other research and prompting techniques to help manage bloated AI costs.For enterprises, the biggest value proposition for Gemini 3 Flash is that it offers the same level of advanced multimodal capabilities, such as complex video analysis and data extraction, as its larger Gemini counterparts, but is far faster and cheaper. While Google’s internal materials highlight a 3x speed increase over the 2.5 Pro series, data from independent benchmarking firm Artificial Analysis adds a layer of crucial nuance. In the latter organization&#x27;s pre-release testing, Gemini 3 Flash Preview recorded a raw throughput of 218 output tokens per second. This makes it 22% slower than the previous &#x27;non-reasoning&#x27; Gemini 2.5 Flash, but it is still significantly faster than rivals including OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.1 high (125 t/s) and DeepSeek V3.2 reasoning (30 t/s).Most notably, Artificial Analysis crowned Gemini 3 Flash as the new leader in their AA-Omniscience knowledge benchmark, where it achieved the highest knowledge accuracy of any model tested to date. However, this intelligence comes with a &#x27;reasoning tax&#x27;: the model more than doubles its token usage compared to the 2.5 Flash series when tackling complex indexes. This high token density is offset by Google&#x27;s aggressive pricing: when accessing through the Gemini API, Gemini 3 Flash costs $0.50 per 1 million input tokens, compared to $1.25/1M input tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and $3/1M output tokens, compared to $ 10/1 M output tokens for Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Within months, usage jumped from zero to 250,000 employees. Now, more than 60% of employees across sales, finance, technology, operations, and other departments use the continually evolving, continually connected suite.“We were surprised by just how viral it was,” Waldron, JPMorgan’s chief analytics officer, explains in a new VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. Employees weren’t just designing prompts, they were building and customizing assistants with specific personas, instructions, and roles and were sharing their learnings on internal platforms. The financial giant has pulled off what most enterprises still struggle to achieve: large-scale, voluntary employee adoption of AI. It wasn’t the result of mandates; rather, early adopters shared tangible use cases, and workers began feeding off each other’s enthusiasm.

Obviously, the social aspect of that is important; to embed yourself and infiltrate socially is a big part of that Bond experience.\" Emborg said the rhythm of a James Bond game is different from a Hitman title, even though espionage, infiltration and subterfuge are at the core of both. \"We have a lot of experience with that from obviously making Hitman, but there are just many more gears to Bond,” he said. “Of course, the shape of this game is different.

          "title": "OnePlus 15R review: A 165Hz display and big battery for $700",
          "standfirst": "I know what you're thinking, didn't OnePlus release a new phone just last month? It did. A little over five weeks after the announcement of the OP15, the company is back with the OnePlus 15R, a more affordable version of its new flagship that starts at $700 (or $200 less than its sibling). Off the top, this will be a shorter review because most of what I said about the OnePlus 15 also applies to the OP15R. It's a great phone that asks you to make one pretty significant compromise. Design and display The OnePlus 15R's screen is slightly cooler than that of the OnePlus 15. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget Like the OnePlus 15, the 15R looks like the OnePlus 13s and 13T, a pair of smaller, 6.32-inch phones the company released in India and China this past spring. I said the design of the OP15 was boring and derivative of the iPhone 16 Pro. The 15R has done nothing to change that opinion. With one fewer camera, the OP15R doesn't look much different from the iPhone 12 I've been hanging on to since 2020. That said, I'm more fond of the 15R's mint breeze color (the phone is also available in charcoal black) than the sand storm shade of my OP15. We're big fans of minty phones here at Engadget, and OnePlus has gone with a particularly pleasing hue of the color with its new phone. With the redesign, OnePlus has also improved the phone's waterproofing, bringing it in line with the OP15. The new handset is IP69K-certified against moisture and dust, meaning it can withstand heated water shot at it at pressure. Like the OP15, the 15R trades OnePlus' old Alert Slider for a new Plus Key. It functions like the iPhone's Action button, allowing you to add a shortcut for a favorite feature. For example, you can configure it to open the camera app or act as a do not disturb toggle, among a few other options. One departure from the OP15 is that the 15R has a larger 6.83-inch display, making it slightly taller than its sibling. OnePlus is marketing this as one reason buyers might pick the 15R over the OP15, but holding the phones side by side, there's not much difference between the two. They're both big, and you'll either like that or won't. On top of being big, the 15R's screen can refresh at a fast 165Hz in games. The two displays are also comparable in terms of resolution and brightness; both can push 1,800 nits of brightness. One difference I noticed is the OnePlus 15 has a warmer panel, even when the two phones are set to the same colorspace. I've reached out to OnePlus to find what might be causing the disparity, but for now it may be due to a quality control issue or oversight in the company's software. One last thing, OnePlus has upgraded the 15R to add an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor beneath the screen. This is placed in a nice spot toward the bottom third of the display, and it's fast and accurate. Performance and battery The OnePlus 15R is also slightly thinner than the OnePlus 15. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget The OnePlus 15R is the first phone in North America to arrive with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 chipset. Not to be confused with the Snapdragon Gen 5 Elite in the OP15, this new chipset is similar to Qualcomm's flagship system-on-a-chip but has a weaker CPU and GPU. This is reflected in benchmarks like Geekbench 6 where the OP15 handily outperforms the OP15R. It's not even close, either, with the OP15 delivering standout single- and multi-core scores of 3,773 and 11,293, while the 15R put up more modest results of 2,857 and 9,512. From that perspective, you're losing a fair amount of performance, but real-world use tells a different story. Outside of the handful of games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and PUBG that support the OP15 and 15R's 165Hz displays, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 offers more than enough muscle for the majority of applications. Even for most games (like the ones I like to play, including Diablo Immortal and League of Legends: Wild Rift), the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 is a great match. OnePlus also hasn't skimped on the 15R's other internal components. You're still getting 12GB of LPDDR5X Ultra RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage. That's the same configuration as the base model of the OP15. This translates to a phone that doesn't miss a beat when switching between apps and loading files like images and videos. The 15R has a slightly bigger battery, coming in at 7,400mAh, up from 7,300mAh on the OP15. In practice, the two phones offer the same amount of battery life. Putting them through both Engadget's video rundown test, they both ran for 38 hours before their batteries died (which makes sense given the OP15R has a bigger screen). Like the OP15, the 15R comes with the OnePlus 55W SUPERVOOC charger in the box. The adapter can get the 15R from dead to 100 percent in less than an hour. If you hate charging your phone, the 15R makes that process as painless as possible, with a battery that both lasts long and won't be at the outlet for hours. Cameras A closeup of the OnePlus 15R's camera module. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget By this point you're probably wondering what OnePlus cut from the OP15 to make the 15R more affordable. The answer — quite literally — is an entire camera. The new phone is missing a telephoto camera, something you could find on its predecessor, the OnePlus 13R. And as far as I can tell, the two remaining cameras use the same 50-megapixel and 8MP sensors OnePlus shipped on last year's model. The company also hasn't upgraded the glass on either camera. That leaves the selfie camera as the only area to see some change in the form of a sharper 32MP sensor and the addition of autofocus. Unfortunately, none of the 15R's cameras stand out. As a whole, they suffer from the same set of problems that plague the OnePlus 15's cameras. They're fine out on a sunny day, but as soon as the light becomes a bit challenging, the 15R struggles with shadow details, resulting in muddy pictures. The more I've used both the OP15 and 15R, the more I've come to the conclusion that OnePlus needs to go back to the drawing board with its new Detail Max Engine. It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware. Software Despite it's large size, the OnePlus 15R isn't too heavy. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget There's not much to say here other than the 15R ships with OxygenOS 16, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize. Wrap-up The OnePlus 15R comes in a lovely mint color. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling. Compared to other phones in its price range, such as the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 FE, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can't compete with those devices in camera quality, but you're getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can't match.

It feels like it's holding back what should, at least on paper, be solid hardware. Software Despite it's large size, the OnePlus 15R isn't too heavy. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget There's not much to say here other than the 15R ships with OxygenOS 16, just like the OP15. OnePlus has also promised to support the 15R for the same amount of time as the OP15: four years with software updates and six years with security patches. That's a shorter window than Google and Samsung, both of which promise seven years on all their latest phones. It's hopefully something that OnePlus decides to change starting with the OnePlus 16. The reason I bring that up is that the company’s version of Android is one I like a lot. OxygenOS is slick, with animations that highlight the speed of the 15R's processor and display. The fact the phone comes with the latest version of OxygenOS means you also get access to all of the company's newest AI features, including its Mind Space hub where you can save screenshots and notes for an on-device model to transcribe and summarize. Wrap-up The OnePlus 15R comes in a lovely mint color. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget In short, the OnePlus 15R is the phone for people who don't care about photos and videos. That's the same conclusion I came to with the OP15. If you're a OnePlus fan, the 15R excels in all the areas you would expect the company's devices to make a good showing: performance, battery life and display responsiveness. Given I wasn't too impressed with the OP15's camera, I would actually recommend the 15R over that model. For $200 off the starting price of the OP15, you're getting a device that has almost all of the same strengths of its more expensive sibling. Compared to other phones in its price range, such as the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 FE, the 15R is not as well-rounded, and can't compete with those devices in camera quality, but you're getting much better performance, battery life and a display they can't match.

          "standfirst": "The best VPNs can make your online life more private with software that's convenient and cheap — sometimes even free. While keeping your IP address invisible, you can use your VPN to explore streaming content from all over the world or (virtually) sneak into a sports event that's not available in your area.However, while VPNs are widely available, there's a strange dearth of information on what they actually do behind the scenes. You may know that a VPN masks your device with a proxy server to make it look like you're somewhere else, and maybe even that encryption is involved. But finding any more details can mean running a gauntlet of misinformation.That's a shame, because the inner workings of a VPN aren't all that difficult to understand. You may not be able to build one yourself without a degree in computer science, but with a little work, you can understand exactly what it's doing on your computer. That's information you can use to select the right VPN for you, and make the most of it once you've got it.What is a VPN?To make sure nobody gets left behind, I'll start from the beginning. A VPN (virtual private network) is a method of securely accessing a network, either a closed network (like you might have at the office) or the internet as a whole. Initially, organizations set up VPNs so remote workers can work with secure files. While this still happens, the last 15 years have seen VPNs increasingly marketed to individuals, with Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and others seeing massive user growth.Broadly, a VPN consists of two parts: the server, which forwards requests to your chosen destination, and the client, a piece of software that lets you interact with the server. You can find a longer explanation here, but I'll use the two sections below to tell you what you need to know right now.One more note before that — there are multiple kinds of VPNs, including the remote-access VPNs and site-to-site VPNs commonly used by workplaces. However, for this article, I'll be talking mainly about the commercial VPN services sold to individuals for general security needs. Instead of a specific network, these VPNs are designed to handle all of a user's traffic to any point on the internet.What happens when you use a VPN?First, you use the client to connect to a server — either the fastest one available or a particular location you need. Once you've connected, every request you send to the internet goes through the VPN server first. This communication between your device and the web is encrypted so it can't be traced back to you.The VPN server decrypts your requests and sends them on. The destination then communicates with the VPN server, which relays the information back to you — after re-encrypting it so nobody follows it home.Since the VPN does everything on your behalf, it's your \"mask\" online. Your internet service provider (ISP) and third parties can see what's being done, but — so long as you’re not otherwise logged in or identifying yourself — nobody knows that it's you doing it. It's like having a friend order pizza for you so the pizzeria doesn't hear you calling for the third time this week (not that I speak from experience).What's the point of using a VPN?Why add an extra step to the already complex process of getting online? The two biggest reasons are maintaining anonymity and changing your virtual location. I've already explained how a VPN keeps you anonymous. Among other things, this prevents your ISP from selling your browsing history to advertisers and protects activists who face government repercussions for what they do online.Changing your virtual location is part of masking, but it can also be used to see the internet as it's visible in other countries. Streaming services are frequently limited to certain places, and almost all of them change the available content based on their licenses in each nation. You can also use a VPN in a country with a nationwide firewall, like China, to see forbidden outside information sources.How does a VPN work? The full technical explanationMost online explanations stop after defining a VPN as an anonymous agent between you and the internet — but I wrote this article to go a little bit deeper. To understand what a VPN is doing on a technical level, we'll need to cover how the internet works, how the VPN knows where to send encrypted information and just what \"encryption\" actually is.How the internet transmits dataWhen you're not using a VPN, internet traffic goes directly from your modem to your ISP, then on to your chosen destination. The key technologies here are IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, and TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol. They're usually combined as TCP/IP.You may have heard that every online device has an IP address that identifies it to every other device. TCP/IP governs not just those names but how data moves between them. Here's how it works, step-by-step.You click a link or enter a URL into your web browser.Your computer sends a request to your modem, asking to see the page associated with the URL. Your modem forwards the request to your ISP.Your ISP finds a domain name server (DNS) that tells it which IP address is connected to the URL you asked to see. It then sends the request to that IP address along the fastest available route, which will involve being relayed between several nodes.That IP address is connected with a server that holds the content you're looking for. Once it receives the request, it breaks the data down into small packets of about 1 to 1.5 kilobytes.These packets separate to find their own fastest routes back to your ISP, your modem and finally your web browser, which reassembles them.You see a web page, likely no more than a second after you asked for it.The outgoing requests and inbound packets are key to understanding VPN function. A VPN intervenes during step 2 (when your modem contacts your ISP) and step 5 (when your ISP sends the packets back to you). In the next section, I'll explain exactly what it does during those steps.How VPN tunneling protects dataYou might have heard a VPN's activities described as \"tunneling.\" That term refers to a figurative tunnel being created between your device and the VPN. Data enters the tunnel when it's encrypted by the VPN client and exits when it's decrypted by the VPN server. Between those two points, encryption means nobody can see the true data. It's as though it's traveling through an opaque tunnel.While the tunnel is a useful metaphor, it may be better to think of VPN encryption as an encapsulation. Each packet of data sent via VPN is \"wrapped\" in a second packet, which both encrypts the original packet and contains information for reaching the VPN server. However, none of these outer layers have the complete path — each just knows enough to reach the next relay. In this way, the origin point (that's you) remains invisible.The same thing happens when the internet returns content to show you. Your ISP sends the data to the VPN server, because, as far as it knows, that's where the request came from. The VPN then encrypts each packet and sends them back to you for decryption and reassembly. It takes a little longer with the extra steps; that's why VPNs always slightly slow down your browsing speed, though the best ones don't do that by much (Surfshark is currently the fastest).You learned in that last section that two protocols, IP and TCP (usually combined as TCP/IP), are responsible for letting online devices talk to each other, even if they've never connected before. In the same way, a VPN protocol is like a shared language that lets VPNs encrypt, move and decrypt information. See the next section to learn how a VPN protocol works in detail.How VPN protocols encrypt dataVPN protocols are the technology behind VPNs; every other feature of your VPN is just a method of interacting with them. All protocols are designed to encrypt data packets and wrap them in a second layer that includes information on where to send them. The main differences are the shape of that second layer, the types of encryption used and how the client establishes its initial secure connection with the server.It's extremely common for VPNs to advertise protocols with \"bank-grade\" or \"military-grade\" encryption. This is talking about the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), a symmetric encryption algorithm, which is used by financial institutions and the US government and military. AES-256 is indeed some of the strongest available encryption, but it's only part of the story. As a symmetric algorithm, it's not fully secure on its own, because the same keys are used to encrypt and decrypt it — and those keys can be stolen.For that reason, most VPN protocols use AES-256 (or a similarly strong cipher like ChaCha20) to encrypt the data packets themselves, then combine it with a larger suite of multiple encryption algorithms. One of the most reliable and popular protocols, OpenVPN, uses the asymmetric TLS protocol to establish a secure relationship between client and server, then transmits packets encrypted with AES-256 across that channel, knowing the keys will be safe.Explaining this could easily reach the length of a book, but the basic principle isn't complicated. In asymmetric encryption, a sender encodes data with a unique key, then a recipient decodes it with a different paired key. The keys are provided by a trusted third party. In a maneuver called a TLS handshake, the server and client send each other encrypted data. If each can decode the other's test data, they know they have a matched pair of keys, which proves that both are the same client and server that got the keys from the trusted authority.Why not just use asymmetric encryption for the data itself, if it's more secure? Mainly, protocols don't do this because it's a lot slower. Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of resource-heavy math that makes connections drag. That's why OpenVPN and others use the asymmetric-to-symmetric two-step instead.To summarize, a VPN protocol is a complex set of instructions and tools that control encryption and routing via VPN servers. Protocols still in use include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2, SSTP and L2TP. PPTP, one of the oldest protocols, is no longer considered secure. On top of these, VPNs often build their own proprietary protocols, such as ExpressVPN's Lightway.Putting it all togetherNow that we've hit all the relevant information, let's revisit that step-by-step from earlier, this time with a VPN in the mix. Here are the steps, starting with establishing the VPN connection and ending with anonymously viewing a website.You open your VPN client, choose a server location and connect. The VPN client and server authenticate each other with a TLS handshake.The client and server exchange the symmetric keys they'll use to encrypt and decrypt packets for the duration of this session (i.e. until you disconnect). Your VPN client tells you that it's established a secure tunnel.You open your web browser and enter a URL. Your browser sends a request to view the content at that address.The request goes to your VPN client, which encrypts it and adds an outer layer of information with directions to the VPN server.The encrypted request reaches the VPN server, which decrypts it and forwards it to your ISP.As normal, your ISP finds the IP address associated with the URL you entered and forwards your request along.The destination server receives the request and sends all the necessary packets of information back to your ISP, which forwards it to the VPN server.The VPN server encrypts each packet and adds a header directing it to the VPN client.The client decrypts the packets and forwards them to your web browser.You see the web page you opened.Because of the encrypted tunnel, the request arrives at the VPN server without any information on where it came from. Thus, the VPN doesn't actually encrypt your activity on the websites themselves — for the most part, the HTTPS protocol does that. Instead, a VPN gives you a false name to put in the register, with no information that could be traced back to your real identity.How to use this informationNow that you know how a VPN works on a technical level, you're better equipped to choose one for yourself. You can cut through marketing hype statements like:\"Military-grade encryption!\" (It's the same algorithm everybody uses)\"Stay completely anonymous online!\" (Plaintext you post on social media is not encrypted)\"Dodge ISP throttling!\" (If your ISP is throttling you based on your IP address, this works — but if you're being slowed down because of your moment-to-moment activity, your identity doesn't matter)A VPN is just one important part of a complete cybersecurity breakfast. While hiding your IP address, make sure to also use strong passwords, download updates immediately and remain alert for social engineering tactics.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Mistral launches OCR 3 to digitize enterprise documents, touts 74% win rate and $2-per-1,000-page pricing",
          "standfirst": "Mistral AI, the French artificial intelligence company valued at €11.7 billion, unveiled its third-generation optical character recognition model on Tuesday, positioning document digitization as the critical first step enterprises must take before realizing the full potential of generative AI.The new model, called Mistral OCR 3, claims a 74% win rate against competing products when processing forms, scanned documents, complex tables, and handwritten content. Mistral priced the technology aggressively at $2 per 1,000 pages — with a 50% discount for batch processing — dramatically undercutting many established enterprise document processing solutions.The release arrives at a pivotal moment for the two-year-old startup. Mistral has spent December on an aggressive product offensive, launching its Mistral 3 family of open-weight models, new coding tools called Devstral 2, and now OCR 3. The company faces intensifying pressure from American rivals flush with capital — OpenAI recently sold secondary shares at a reported $500 billion valuation, while Anthropic raised $13 billion in September — and potential regulatory friction as the Trump administration threatens retaliation against European companies over EU technology laws.Why enterprises can&#x27;t adopt AI until they solve their paper problemMarjorie Janiewicz, Mistral&#x27;s Chief Revenue Officer who oversees global revenue including solutions architecture and forward deployment engineering, framed the OCR release as a direct response to patterns the company observed while helping enterprises deploy AI over the past year.\"A lot of very large enterprises are still sitting on a very large volume of critical data that&#x27;s not digitized yet,\" Janiewicz said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That data that&#x27;s not digitized represents a massive competitive moat.\"The observation cuts to the heart of a widely documented problem in enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in AI initiatives, most organizations struggle to move beyond proof-of-concept projects into production systems that generate measurable returns. Research consistently shows a significant gap between AI experimentation and real business value.Janiewicz argued that document digitization creates two distinct opportunities. First, it unlocks institutional knowledge accumulated over decades — proprietary data that could power personalized AI systems and agents. Second, it enables the workflow automation that promises to transform day-to-day operations but remains stalled in document-heavy industries.\"When you think about workflow transformation, a lot of enterprises today could benefit from really transformational workflow automation if the data that was core to their business was fully digitized,\" Janiewicz explained.From anti-money laundering to insurance claims, how OCR transforms regulated industriesMistral designed OCR 3 to excel across the regulated, document-intensive industries where AI adoption has proven most challenging — and where the stakes for accuracy are highest.In financial services, Janiewicz pointed to anti-money laundering compliance and know-your-customer processes, where banks process millions of documents annually to meet regulatory requirements. \"When you think about opening a bank account, or a lot of the tasks that are still being done in retail banks, it&#x27;s on paper,\" she said. \"When you start correlating that to anti-money laundering workflow automation processes, or KYC as a customer support process, where governance and being able to inspect things is so essential — a lot of the banks are talking to us about the need to accelerate the pace, the accuracy and the performance of the digitization process.\"The insurance industry presents similar challenges. Claim management workflows require connecting photographs of vehicle damage, handwritten accident reports, and policy documentation to automated processing engines. Healthcare organizations grapple with admission forms, medical histories, prescription records, and consent documentation scattered across paper and digital formats.Manufacturing drew particular enthusiasm from Janiewicz. \"I love manufacturing as an industry,\" she said. \"When you start thinking about the very complex technical documents, many of those documents are either not digitized yet, or they are so complex that extracting valuable information from them to accelerate the manufacturing process, or even innovation, is a challenge.\"Mistral claims major accuracy gains on handwriting, complex tables, and damaged scansAccording to Mistral&#x27;s benchmarks, OCR 3 demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across several categories that have historically challenged optical character recognition systems.The model interprets cursive handwriting, mixed-content annotations, and handwritten text layered over printed forms — scenarios that frequently produce errors in traditional OCR systems. It reconstructs complex table structures with headers, merged cells, multi-row blocks, and column hierarchies, outputting HTML table tags that preserve layout for downstream processing.Perhaps most notably for organizations dealing with legacy documents, Mistral claims substantial improvements in handling the artifacts that plague real-world document processing: compression artifacts, skew, distortion, low resolution, and background noise.Tim Law, IDC&#x27;s Director of Research for AI and Automation, underscored the strategic importance of the technology. \"OCR remains foundational for enabling generative AI and agentic AI,\" Law said. \"Those organizations that can efficiently and cost-effectively extract text and embedded images with high fidelity will unlock value and will gain a competitive advantage from their data by providing richer context.\"When asked what prevents well-funded competitors from replicating Mistral&#x27;s approach within months, Janiewicz emphasized the accuracy gap that has frustrated enterprise deployments.\"Enterprises have two and a half years of history with competitive OCR solutions, and the reason we think this is a real advantage for us is accuracy,\" she said. \"Many enterprises are complaining about the accuracy of those systems, which has slowed their ability to digitize their documents.\"How Mistral AI Studio creates a complete document-to-production pipelineBeyond raw model performance, Mistral positioned OCR 3 as part of a vertically integrated stack designed for complex enterprise deployments. The model operates within Document AI, a component of Mistral AI Studio that the company introduced in October as its production platform for enterprise AI development.Mistral AI Studio provides observability, agent runtime capabilities, and an AI registry — infrastructure Janiewicz described as essential for moving AI from experimentation to reliable production systems. OCR 3 feeds directly into this ecosystem, connecting document processing to the company&#x27;s broader model offerings and workflow tools.\"It&#x27;s the vertical integration of OCR, the models, and Studio, coupled with accuracy, that I think is creating a very differentiated play,\" Janiewicz said. \"Most companies today are struggling with off-the-shelf solutions not being good enough to help them transform a complex workflow.\"The release supports deployment across cloud, virtual private cloud, and on-premises environments — flexibility that matters enormously for regulated industries where data sovereignty and security concerns dictate infrastructure decisions.Keeping enterprise data &#x27;home&#x27; in an era of AI security concernsFor financial services, healthcare, and other heavily regulated industries, questions about data handling during AI processing carry significant weight. Janiewicz addressed these concerns directly.\"Many times the models are going to be used on their own GPUs,\" she said, referring to on-premises and VPC deployments. \"That&#x27;s a great way to make sure companies feel that the data is home — it&#x27;s not going to be exposed to anyone else.\"On the sensitive question of training data, Janiewicz was unequivocal: \"For all our training, we never use our customers&#x27; data to train.\"The company announced a partnership with HSBC in recent weeks to build productivity tools for the multinational bank — a significant validation of Mistral&#x27;s enterprise security posture in one of the world&#x27;s most demanding regulatory environments.Mistral&#x27;s December product blitz signals an aggressive push against OpenAI and AnthropicThe OCR 3 release extends Mistral&#x27;s December product blitz, which began when the company launched its Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on December 2. That release included Mistral Large 3, a frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities, alongside nine smaller Ministral 3 models designed for edge deployment on devices with limited connectivity.The company followed up a week later with Devstral 2, a new generation of coding models, and Mistral Vibe, a command-line interface for code automation through natural language — a direct play for the \"vibe coding\" market that has fueled the rise of companies like Cursor.These releases build on substantial infrastructure partnerships. Microsoft distributes Mistral models through Azure Foundry, with OCR 3 expected to become available on the platform. Amazon Web Services added Mistral Large 3 and Ministral 3 models to Amazon Bedrock in early December, providing fully managed access alongside models from Google, OpenAI, and others.Mistral&#x27;s roughly $2 billion (€1.7 billion) Series C round in September, led by Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML with participation from NVIDIA, DST Global, and Andreessen Horowitz, gave the company resources to accelerate development. But the funding pales against American competitors — OpenAI sold secondary shares in October at a $500 billion valuation, making it the world&#x27;s most valuable private company, while Anthropic reached a $350 billion valuation in November following investments from Microsoft and Nvidia.Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s co-founder and chief scientist, has argued that bigger isn&#x27;t always better for enterprise use cases. \"In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,\" Lample said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.Janiewicz echoed this philosophy. \"The biggest learning over the past 12 months is that off-the-shelf AI is not cutting it in driving real value for the enterprise in production,\" she said. \"Customization of the models, customization of the technology, giving control back to enterprises to build their own AI solutions — that&#x27;s absolutely paramount.\"US-EU technology tensions create new risks for European AI companiesMistral&#x27;s aggressive expansion comes as European technology companies face potential regulatory retaliation from the United States. The Trump administration warned last week that it would use \"every tool at its disposal\" if the European Union continued enforcing its technology laws, putting companies including Mistral, Spotify, Siemens, and Publicis in a precarious position.The European Commission responded that its rules \"apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,\" but the standoff introduces uncertainty for European AI companies seeking American enterprise customers.Mistral has differentiated itself from Chinese competitors like DeepSeek and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen by emphasizing its Apache 2.0 licensing and worldwide availability without regional restrictions — a positioning that takes on added significance amid escalating technology tensions between major economic blocs.Aggressive pricing suggests Mistral sees OCR as a gateway to deeper enterprise relationshipsJaniewicz outlined three revenue pillars for Mistral: complex workflow transformation using Mistral Studio and forward deployment engineering; research and development partnerships to co-build specialized models; and productivity tools including the Le Chat assistant and Mistral Code for developers.Document AI and OCR fit into the first pillar while potentially serving as an entry point that leads customers into deeper engagements. \"OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,\" Janiewicz said.The aggressive pricing — significantly below many enterprise document processing alternatives — suggests Mistral views OCR as a wedge product rather than a primary profit center. Early customers use the technology to process invoices into structured fields, digitize corporate archives, extract clean text from technical and scientific reports, and improve enterprise search.The company also highlighted accessibility applications. AI-powered OCR can transform printed, handwritten, or scanned documents into searchable digital formats compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies — a capability with implications for compliance with disability access requirements in education and government.The unsexy problem that could determine who wins the enterprise AI raceMistral&#x27;s OCR 3 is a calculated wager that the path to enterprise AI dominance runs not through ever-larger language models, but through the unglamorous work of converting paper into data. While competitors race to build more powerful chatbots and autonomous agents, the French startup is betting that enterprises can&#x27;t use any of those tools until they first digitize the institutional knowledge buried in filing cabinets and PDF archives.\"For us, OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,\" Janiewicz said. \"To us, really, the key message is customization, portability, and control is the secret sauce to ROI.\"The model becomes available Tuesday through Mistral&#x27;s API and the Document AI interface in Mistral AI Studio. Developers can access it using the identifier mistral-ocr-2512.",
          "content": "Mistral AI, the French artificial intelligence company valued at €11.7 billion, unveiled its third-generation optical character recognition model on Tuesday, positioning document digitization as the critical first step enterprises must take before realizing the full potential of generative AI.The new model, called Mistral OCR 3, claims a 74% win rate against competing products when processing forms, scanned documents, complex tables, and handwritten content. Mistral priced the technology aggressively at $2 per 1,000 pages — with a 50% discount for batch processing — dramatically undercutting many established enterprise document processing solutions.The release arrives at a pivotal moment for the two-year-old startup. Mistral has spent December on an aggressive product offensive, launching its Mistral 3 family of open-weight models, new coding tools called Devstral 2, and now OCR 3. The company faces intensifying pressure from American rivals flush with capital — OpenAI recently sold secondary shares at a reported $500 billion valuation, while Anthropic raised $13 billion in September — and potential regulatory friction as the Trump administration threatens retaliation against European companies over EU technology laws.Why enterprises can&#x27;t adopt AI until they solve their paper problemMarjorie Janiewicz, Mistral&#x27;s Chief Revenue Officer who oversees global revenue including solutions architecture and forward deployment engineering, framed the OCR release as a direct response to patterns the company observed while helping enterprises deploy AI over the past year.\"A lot of very large enterprises are still sitting on a very large volume of critical data that&#x27;s not digitized yet,\" Janiewicz said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That data that&#x27;s not digitized represents a massive competitive moat.\"The observation cuts to the heart of a widely documented problem in enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in AI initiatives, most organizations struggle to move beyond proof-of-concept projects into production systems that generate measurable returns. Research consistently shows a significant gap between AI experimentation and real business value.Janiewicz argued that document digitization creates two distinct opportunities. First, it unlocks institutional knowledge accumulated over decades — proprietary data that could power personalized AI systems and agents. Second, it enables the workflow automation that promises to transform day-to-day operations but remains stalled in document-heavy industries.\"When you think about workflow transformation, a lot of enterprises today could benefit from really transformational workflow automation if the data that was core to their business was fully digitized,\" Janiewicz explained.From anti-money laundering to insurance claims, how OCR transforms regulated industriesMistral designed OCR 3 to excel across the regulated, document-intensive industries where AI adoption has proven most challenging — and where the stakes for accuracy are highest.In financial services, Janiewicz pointed to anti-money laundering compliance and know-your-customer processes, where banks process millions of documents annually to meet regulatory requirements. \"When you think about opening a bank account, or a lot of the tasks that are still being done in retail banks, it&#x27;s on paper,\" she said. \"When you start correlating that to anti-money laundering workflow automation processes, or KYC as a customer support process, where governance and being able to inspect things is so essential — a lot of the banks are talking to us about the need to accelerate the pace, the accuracy and the performance of the digitization process.\"The insurance industry presents similar challenges. Claim management workflows require connecting photographs of vehicle damage, handwritten accident reports, and policy documentation to automated processing engines. Healthcare organizations grapple with admission forms, medical histories, prescription records, and consent documentation scattered across paper and digital formats.Manufacturing drew particular enthusiasm from Janiewicz. \"I love manufacturing as an industry,\" she said. \"When you start thinking about the very complex technical documents, many of those documents are either not digitized yet, or they are so complex that extracting valuable information from them to accelerate the manufacturing process, or even innovation, is a challenge.\"Mistral claims major accuracy gains on handwriting, complex tables, and damaged scansAccording to Mistral&#x27;s benchmarks, OCR 3 demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across several categories that have historically challenged optical character recognition systems.The model interprets cursive handwriting, mixed-content annotations, and handwritten text layered over printed forms — scenarios that frequently produce errors in traditional OCR systems.

          "standfirst": "Patronus AI, the artificial intelligence evaluation startup backed by $20 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Datadog, unveiled a new training architecture Tuesday that it says represents a fundamental shift in how AI agents learn to perform complex tasks.The technology, which the company calls \"Generative Simulators,\" creates adaptive simulation environments that continuously generate new challenges, update rules dynamically, and evaluate an agent&#x27;s performance as it learns — all in real time. The approach marks a departure from the static benchmarks that have long served as the industry standard for measuring AI capabilities but have increasingly come under fire for failing to predict real-world performance.\"Traditional benchmarks measure isolated capabilities, but they miss the interruptions, context switches, and layered decision-making that define real work,\" said Anand Kannappan, chief executive and co-founder of Patronus AI, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"For agents to perform at human levels, they need to learn the way humans do—through dynamic experience and continuous feedback.\"The announcement arrives at a critical moment for the AI industry. AI agents are reshaping software development, from writing code to carrying out complex instructions. Yet LLM-based agents are prone to errors and often perform poorly on complicated, multi-step tasks. Research published earlier this year found that an agent with just a 1% error rate per step can compound to a 63% chance of failure by the hundredth step — a sobering statistic for enterprises seeking to deploy autonomous AI systems at scale.Why static AI benchmarks are failing — and what comes nextPatronus AI&#x27;s approach addresses what the company describes as a growing mismatch between how AI systems are evaluated and how they actually perform in production. Traditional benchmarks, the company argues, function like standardized tests: they measure specific capabilities at a fixed point in time but struggle to capture the messy, unpredictable nature of real work.The new Generative Simulators architecture flips this model. Rather than presenting agents with a fixed set of questions, the system generates assignments, environmental conditions, and oversight processes on the fly, then adapts based on how the agent behaves.\"Over the past year, we&#x27;ve seen a shift away from traditional static benchmarks toward more interactive learning grounds,\" Rebecca Qian, chief technology officer and co-founder of Patronus AI, told VentureBeat. \"This is partly because of the innovation we&#x27;ve seen from model developers — the shift toward reinforcement learning, post-training, and continual learning, and away from supervised instruction tuning. What that means is there&#x27;s been a collapse in the distinction between training and evaluation. Benchmarks have become environments.\"The technology builds on reinforcement learning — an approach where AI systems learn through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for mistakes. Reinforcement learning is an approach where AI systems learn to make optimal decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions, improving through trial and error. RL can help agents improve, but it typically requires developers to extensively rewrite their code. This discourages adoption, even though the data these agents generate could significantly boost performance through RL training.Patronus AI also introduced a new concept it calls \"Open Recursive Self-Improvement,\" or ORSI — environments where agents can continuously improve through interaction and feedback without requiring a complete retraining cycle between attempts. The company positions this as critical infrastructure for developing AI systems capable of learning continuously rather than being frozen at a point in time.Inside the &#x27;Goldilocks Zone&#x27;: How adaptive AI training finds the sweet spotAt the heart of Generative Simulators lies what Patronus AI calls a \"curriculum adjuster\" — a component that analyzes agent behavior and dynamically modifies the difficulty and nature of training scenarios. The approach draws inspiration from how effective human teachers adapt their instruction based on student performance.Qian explained the approach using an analogy: \"You can think of this as a teacher-student model, where we&#x27;re training the model and the professor continually adapts the curriculum.\"This adaptive approach addresses a problem that Kannappan described as finding the \"Goldilocks Zone\" in training data — ensuring that examples are neither too easy nor too hard for a given model to learn from effectively.\"What&#x27;s important is not just whether you can train on a data set, but whether you can train on a high-quality data set that&#x27;s tuned to your model—one it can actually learn from,\" Kannappan said. \"We want to make sure the examples aren&#x27;t too hard for the model, nor too easy.\"The company says initial results show meaningful improvements in agent performance. Training on Patronus AI&#x27;s environments has increased task completion rates by 10% to 20% across real-world tasks including software engineering, customer service, and financial analysis, according to the company.The AI cheating problem: How &#x27;moving target&#x27; environments prevent reward hackingOne of the most persistent challenges in training AI agents through reinforcement learning is a phenomenon researchers call \"reward hacking\"—where systems learn to exploit loopholes in their training environment rather than genuinely solving problems. Famous examples include early agents that learned to hide in corners of video games rather than actually play them.Generative Simulators addresses this by making the training environment itself a moving target.\"Reward hacking is fundamentally a problem when systems are static. It&#x27;s like students learning to cheat on a test,\" Qian said. \"But when we&#x27;re continually evolving the environment, we can actually look at parts of the system that need to adapt and evolve. Static benchmarks are fixed targets; generative simulator environments are moving targets.\"Patronus AI reports 15x revenue growth as enterprise demand for agent training surgesPatronus AI positions Generative Simulators as the foundation for a new product line it calls \"RL Environments\" — training grounds designed for foundation model laboratories and enterprises building agents for specific domains. The company says this offering represents a strategic expansion beyond its original focus on evaluation tools.\"We&#x27;ve grown 15x in revenue this year, largely due to the high-quality environments we&#x27;ve developed that have been shown to be extremely learnable by different kinds of frontier models,\" Kannappan said.The CEO declined to specify absolute revenue figures but said the new product has allowed the company to \"move higher up the stack in terms of where we sell and who we sell to.\" The company&#x27;s platform is used by numerous Fortune 500 enterprises and leading AI companies around the world.Why OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can&#x27;t build everything in-houseA central question facing Patronus AI is why the deep-pocketed laboratories developing frontier models—organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind — would license training infrastructure rather than build it themselves.Kannappan acknowledged that these companies \"are investing significantly in environments\" but argued that the breadth of domains requiring specialized training creates a natural opening for third-party providers.\"They want to improve agents on lots of different domains, whether it&#x27;s coding or tool use or navigating browsers or workflows across finance, healthcare, energy, and education,\" he said. \"Solving all those different operational problems is very difficult for a single company to do.\"The competitive landscape is intensifying. Microsoft recently released Agent Lightning, an open-source framework that makes reinforcement learning work for any AI agent without rewrites. NVIDIA&#x27;s NeMo Gym offers modular RL infrastructure for developing agentic AI systems. Meta researchers released DreamGym in November, a framework that simulates RL environments and dynamically adjusts task difficulty as agents improve.&#x27;Environments are the new oil&#x27;: Patronus AI&#x27;s audacious bet on the future of AI trainingLooking ahead, Patronus AI frames its mission in sweeping terms. The company wants to \"environmentalize all of the world&#x27;s data\" — converting human workflows into structured systems that AI can learn from.\"We think that everything should be an environment—internally, we joke that environments are the new oil,\" Kannappan said. \"Reinforcement learning is just one training method, but the construct of an environment is what really matters.\"Qian described the opportunity in expansive terms: \"This is an entirely new field of research, which doesn&#x27;t happen every day. Generative simulation is inspired by early research in robotics and embodied agents. It&#x27;s been a pipe dream for decades, and we&#x27;re only now able to achieve these ideas because of the capabilities of today&#x27;s models.\"The company launched in September 2023 with a focus on evaluation — helping enterprises identify hallucinations and safety issues in AI outputs. That mission has now expanded upstream into training itself. Patronus AI argues that the traditional separation between evaluation and training is collapsing — and that whoever controls the environments where AI agents learn will shape their capabilities.\"We are really at this critical point, this inflection point, where what we do right now will impact what the world is going to look like for generations to come,\" Qian said.Whether Generative Simulators can deliver on that promise remains to be seen. The company&#x27;s 15x revenue growth suggests enterprise customers are hungry for solutions, but deep-pocketed players from Microsoft to Meta are racing to solve the same fundamental problem. If the last two years have taught the industry anything, it&#x27;s that in AI, the future has a habit of arriving ahead of schedule.",

Famous examples include early agents that learned to hide in corners of video games rather than actually play them.Generative Simulators addresses this by making the training environment itself a moving target.\"Reward hacking is fundamentally a problem when systems are static. It&#x27;s like students learning to cheat on a test,\" Qian said. \"But when we&#x27;re continually evolving the environment, we can actually look at parts of the system that need to adapt and evolve. Static benchmarks are fixed targets; generative simulator environments are moving targets.\"Patronus AI reports 15x revenue growth as enterprise demand for agent training surgesPatronus AI positions Generative Simulators as the foundation for a new product line it calls \"RL Environments\" — training grounds designed for foundation model laboratories and enterprises building agents for specific domains. The company says this offering represents a strategic expansion beyond its original focus on evaluation tools.\"We&#x27;ve grown 15x in revenue this year, largely due to the high-quality environments we&#x27;ve developed that have been shown to be extremely learnable by different kinds of frontier models,\" Kannappan said.The CEO declined to specify absolute revenue figures but said the new product has allowed the company to \"move higher up the stack in terms of where we sell and who we sell to.\" The company&#x27;s platform is used by numerous Fortune 500 enterprises and leading AI companies around the world.Why OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can&#x27;t build everything in-houseA central question facing Patronus AI is why the deep-pocketed laboratories developing frontier models—organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind — would license training infrastructure rather than build it themselves.Kannappan acknowledged that these companies \"are investing significantly in environments\" but argued that the breadth of domains requiring specialized training creates a natural opening for third-party providers.\"They want to improve agents on lots of different domains, whether it&#x27;s coding or tool use or navigating browsers or workflows across finance, healthcare, energy, and education,\" he said. \"Solving all those different operational problems is very difficult for a single company to do.\"The competitive landscape is intensifying. Microsoft recently released Agent Lightning, an open-source framework that makes reinforcement learning work for any AI agent without rewrites. NVIDIA&#x27;s NeMo Gym offers modular RL infrastructure for developing agentic AI systems. Meta researchers released DreamGym in November, a framework that simulates RL environments and dynamically adjusts task difficulty as agents improve.&#x27;Environments are the new oil&#x27;: Patronus AI&#x27;s audacious bet on the future of AI trainingLooking ahead, Patronus AI frames its mission in sweeping terms. The company wants to \"environmentalize all of the world&#x27;s data\" — converting human workflows into structured systems that AI can learn from.\"We think that everything should be an environment—internally, we joke that environments are the new oil,\" Kannappan said. \"Reinforcement learning is just one training method, but the construct of an environment is what really matters.\"Qian described the opportunity in expansive terms: \"This is an entirely new field of research, which doesn&#x27;t happen every day. Generative simulation is inspired by early research in robotics and embodied agents. It&#x27;s been a pipe dream for decades, and we&#x27;re only now able to achieve these ideas because of the capabilities of today&#x27;s models.\"The company launched in September 2023 with a focus on evaluation — helping enterprises identify hallucinations and safety issues in AI outputs. That mission has now expanded upstream into training itself. Patronus AI argues that the traditional separation between evaluation and training is collapsing — and that whoever controls the environments where AI agents learn will shape their capabilities.\"We are really at this critical point, this inflection point, where what we do right now will impact what the world is going to look like for generations to come,\" Qian said.Whether Generative Simulators can deliver on that promise remains to be seen. The company&#x27;s 15x revenue growth suggests enterprise customers are hungry for solutions, but deep-pocketed players from Microsoft to Meta are racing to solve the same fundamental problem. If the last two years have taught the industry anything, it&#x27;s that in AI, the future has a habit of arriving ahead of schedule.",

The satellites were nestled inside a cylindrical dispenser on top of the 59-foot-tall (18-meter) Electron rocket when it lifted off from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility at 12:03 am EST (05:03 UTC). A little more than an hour later, the rocket’s upper stage released the satellites one at a time at an altitude of about 340 miles (550 kilometers). The launch was the starting gun for a “proof of concept” mission to test the viability of a new kind of satellite called DiskSats. These satellites were designed by the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit federally funded research and development center.

As previously reported, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, we reported on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.) Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia analyzed the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.Read full article Comments",

The channels, which had a combined audience of more than 2 million subscribers, became a thorn in Google’s side in early 2025 when other YouTubers began griping about their sudden popularity in the age of AI. The channels produced videos with titles like “GTA: San Andreas (2025) Teaser Trailer” and “Malcom In The Middle Reboot (2025) First Trailer.” Of course, neither of those projects exist, but that didn’t stop them from appearing in user feeds. Google demonetized the channels in early 2025, forcing them to adopt language that made it clear they were not official trailers. The channels were able to monetize again, but the disclaimers were not consistently used. Indeed, many of the most popular videos from those channels in recent months included no “parody” or “concept trailer” disclosures. Now, visiting either channel’s page on YouTube produces an error reading, “This page isn’t available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "There have been a number of high-profile cases where scientific papers have had to be retracted because they were filled with AI-generated slop—the most recent coming just two weeks ago. These instances raise serious questions about the quality of peer review in some journals—how could anyone let a figure with terms like “runctitional,” “fexcectorn,” and “frymblal” through, especially given the ‘m’ in frymblal has an extra hump? But it has not been clear whether these high-profile examples are representative. How significantly has AI use been influencing the scientific literature? A collaboration of researchers at Berkeley and Cornell have decided to take a look. They’ve scanned three of the largest archives of pre-publication papers and identified ones that are likely to have been produced using Large Language Models. And they found that, while researchers produce far more papers after starting to use AI and the quality of the language used went up, the publication rate of these papers has dropped. Searching the archives The researchers began by obtaining the abstracts of everything placed in three major pre-publication archives between 2018 and mid-2024. At the arXiv, this netted them 1.2 million documents; another 675,000 were found in the Social Science Research Network; and bioRxiv provided another 220,000. So, this was both a lot of material to work with and covered a lot of different fields of research. It also included documents that were submitted before Large Language Models were likely to be able to produce output that would be deemed acceptable.Read full article Comments",

At the time, the leaders of the space agency expected this next lander could be ready for launch as soon as 2026—or more likely in 2028. Its mission would have been to retrieve Martian rock specimens collected by the Perseverance rover, then billed as the first leg of a multilaunch, multibillion-dollar Mars Sample Return campaign. Here we are on the verge of 2026, and there’s no sample retrieval mission nearing the launch pad. In fact, no one is building such a lander at all. NASA’s strategy for a Mars Sample Return, or MSR, mission remains undecided after the projected cost of the original plan ballooned to $11 billion. If MSR happens at all, it’s now unlikely to launch until the 2030s.Read full article Comments",

I’m one such player, and I don’t miss the size, weight, deafening volume, or cost of owning an amp and cabinet collection, to say nothing of all those pedals and cables. For clean to mid-gain tones alone, I already have more terrific options than I need, including Neural DSP’s Tone King and Cory Wong and Mateus Asato, Polychrome DSP’s Lumos, and Universal Audio’s new Paradise Guitar Studio. All work slightly differently, but they can each output record-ready tones that are really, really close to the (often incredibly expensive) hardware that they model, and they each give you plenty of great-sounding presets to start from. So do we really need one amp sim package? Neural DSP thinks we do, because the Finnish company just dropped a major new release yesterday called Archetype: John Mayer X. It doesn’t model Mayer’s type of gear but his actual hardware units, along with all the actual settings he uses in the studio and on stage. It even has some presets that he designed.

That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. The story behind this remarkable achievement is nowhere more fully told than in the book Reentry, authored by Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. To mark the tenth anniversary, Ars is reprinting a slightly condensed chapter from the book that tells the inside story of this landing. The chapter begins in June 2015 with a tragedy, the disintegration of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the CRS-7 cargo supply mission for NASA. It was the first time a Falcon 9 had been lost in flight. Seconds after the Dragon-bearing Falcon 9 rocket broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, David Giger shouted into his headset, “Dragon is alive!” In the decade since he joined the company straight out of graduate school, Giger had taken on management of the entire Dragon program, reporting directly to Elon Musk. He watched the CRS-7 launch from mission control in Hawthorne not with a particular role, but rather providing a leadership presence. Giger could sense the Dragon mission team, mostly younger engineers, freeze up as video showed debris from the rocket showering back to Earth. A lot of the people involved in the hairy early flights of Dragon, including the C2 mission in 2012, had moved on to other positions at SpaceX or departed.Read full article Comments",

On Tuesday, OpenAI released a tool that reduces the process to typing a sentence. It’s not the first company to do so. While OpenAI had a conversational image-editing model in the works since GPT-4o in 2024, Google beat OpenAI to market in March with a public prototype, then refined it to a popular model called Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro). The enthusiastic response to Google’s image-editing model in the AI community got OpenAI’s attention. OpenAI’s new GPT Image 1.5 is an AI image synthesis model that reportedly generates images up to four times faster than its predecessor and costs about 20 percent less through the API. The model rolled out to all ChatGPT users on Tuesday and represents another step toward making photorealistic image manipulation a casual process that requires no particular visual skills.Read full article Comments",

Bushart is a former cop who lost his post-retirement job after a seemingly vengeful sheriff jailed him for trolling a Charlie Kirk vigil post in a Facebook group. Upset that Kirk’s death commanded more attention than other victims of gun violence, Bushart posted a string of memes, among which was an image of Trump with an actual quote saying “We have to get over it” about a 2024 school shooting. Perry County sheriff Nick Weems has since acknowledged that he “knew” that the meme referenced a prior school shooting. However, the entire time that Bushart was detained, Weems maintained that Bushart’s post incited “mass hysteria” from parents concerned that he was threatening violence at a local high school. Painting Bushart as indifferent to the supposed hysteria, Weems justified his arrest, as well as the $2 million bond ensuring Bushart couldn’t afford bail and remained behind bars.Read full article Comments",

When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company. WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV Skateboard (PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too. The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s). The two companies see plenty of potential for the platform, which they say could give rise to “multiple vehicle configurations from beach buggies to high-performance sports cars to commercial delivery vehicles.”Read full article Comments",

Perhaps you’ve noticed that this seems to lessen your pain. There’s a growing body of scientific evidence that this is indeed the case. The technical term is the “hypoalgesic effect of swearing.” Cursing can also improve physical strength and endurance, according to a new paper published in the journal American Psychologist. As previously reported, co-author Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele, became interested in studying the potential benefits of profanity after noting his wife’s “unsavory language” while giving birth and wondered if profanity really could help alleviate pain. “Swearing is such a common response to pain. There has to be an underlying reason why we do it,” Stephens told Scientific American after publishing a 2009 study that was awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel Peace Prize. For that study, Stephens and his colleagues asked 67 study participants (college students) to immerse their hands in a bucket of ice water. They were then instructed to either swear repeatedly using the profanity of their choice or chant a neutral word. Lo and behold, the participants said they experienced less pain when they swore and were also able to leave their hands in the bucket about 40 seconds longer than when they weren’t swearing. It has been suggested that this is a primitive reflex that serves as a form of catharsis.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "While not quite a separate dialect, Formula 1-speak can be heavy on the jargon at times. They say “box” instead of pit, “power unit” to describe the engine and hybrid system, and that’s before we get into all the aerodynamics-related expressions like “outwash” and “dirty air.” Next year is a big technical shakeup for the sport, and it seems we’re getting some new terminology to go with it. So forget your DRS and get ready to talk about Boost mode instead. The F1 car of 2026 will be slightly narrower and slightly lighter than the machines that raced for the last time earlier this month. But not by a huge amount: minimum weight is decreased by 30 kg to 724 kg, the wheelbase is 200 mm shorter at 3,400 mm, and the car’s underfloor is 150 mm narrower than before. The front wing is 100 mm narrower and has just two elements to it, although for the first time in F1 history, this is now an active wing, which works in conjunction with the three-element active rear wing. Active rear wings have been a thing in F1 since the introduction of DRS—the drag reduction system—in 2011, but now there’s a philosophical change to how they’ll work.Read full article Comments",

But his most remarkable flying has occurred over the last year. And on Wednesday, he stuck the landing by earning formal Senate approval to become NASA’s 15th administrator. With a final tally of 67 to 30, Wednesday’s Senate confirmation came 377 days after President Trump first nominated Isaacman to serve as NASA administrator. Since that time, Isaacman had to navigate the following issues:Read full article Comments",

The secret is evaporative cooling, according to a preprint posted to the physics arXiv. Evaporative cooling is a well-known phenomenon; mammals use it to regulate body temperature. You can see it in your morning cup of hot coffee: the hotter atoms rise to the top of the magnetic trap and “jump out” as steam. It also plays a role (along with shock wave dynamics and various other factors) in the formation of “wine tears.” It’s a key step in creating Bose-Einstein condensates. And evaporative cooling is also the main culprit behind the infamous “stall” that so frequently plagues aspiring BBQ pit masters eager to make a successful pork butt. The meat sweats as it cooks, releasing the moisture within, and that moisture evaporates and cools the meat, effectively canceling out the heat from the BBQ. That’s why a growing number of competitive pit masters wrap their meat in tinfoil after the first few hours (usually when the internal temperature hits 170° F).Read full article Comments",
