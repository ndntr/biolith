          "standfirst": "The food coma may be strong right now, but it’s wise to check out the internet for the best Thanksgiving Black Friday deals you can get this year. With Black Friday no longer being a one-day affair, that means you can find excellent discounts online even on Thanksgiving when all brick-and-mortar locations are closed. It’s also wise to shop early for anything you think might sell out — that category typically includes a lot of tech, like AirPods, game consoles, new video games and more. Check out our curated list of the best Thanksgiving deals you can get right now below. Best Thanksgiving Black Friday deals Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Most other AirPods are also on sale, including the AirPods 4 and AirPods Max. Read more: The best Apple Black Friday deals on iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches and more iPad A16 for $274 (21 percent off): The entry level iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, but that didn’t bother us when we reviewed the new slate. We found the speed to be plenty for what most people need an iPad for: casual gaming, streaming, browsing, answering some emails. We wish the display was laminated and had some anti-glare coating. But this is the lowest-priced way to get your hands on a current-model iPad. Also at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Read more: The best Black Friday streaming deals: Save on Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max and more Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced and, unsurprisingly, there aren't many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Also available at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Read more: The best Black Friday deals for $50 or less Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Read more: The best Lego Black Friday deals for 2025 Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $88 (35 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best power banks, this Anker brick is kind of a one-and-done device. It has enough capacity to charge all sorts of devices from smartphones to laptops to handheld gaming consoles, and it has two built-in USB-C cables so you don't even have to remember to bring your own to use it. Also available at Anker.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a PlayStation 5, this Black Friday deal is worth noting. Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179. You'll find a ton of PlayStation Black Friday deals across the web right now, and they also include some game sales.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones. Joy-Con 2 bundle Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Camera Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Hori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera Amazon Best Buy Joy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo More Nintendo Black Friday deals Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

          "standfirst": "Disney fans and binge-watchers, rejoice. The Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) is getting a holiday discount again this year, bringing both platforms together for one low price of $5 per month for one year. The bundle includes the Disney+ basic plan with ads and Hulu’s basic plan with ads. If you’re a new subscriber or an eligible returning customer, you can get this discount that brings the cost of both services down to $60 in total for one year. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

It’s a short-term offer, so you’ll want to grab it while it’s available. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Apple TV+ continues to build one of the strongest lineups in streaming. Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience. All content is ad-free and available in up to 4K HDR, with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support where available. The app works on nearly every device, from iPhone and iPad to smart TVs, PlayStation, Xbox and Roku. You can also download episodes and movies to watch offline, which is handy for travel or long commutes. If you’re already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the integration is seamless. You can share your subscription with up to five other people through Family Sharing, and playback syncs across devices so you can start a show on your iPhone and finish it on your TV. Apple TV+ is also part of the Apple One bundle if you prefer to manage multiple Apple services under a single plan. This deal is available to new and qualified returning subscribers, meaning those who haven’t had an active subscription in the past 30 days. You’ll need to sign up directly through Apple rather than a third-party service or carrier. Once the three-month period ends, the plan renews at the standard $13 per month, so be sure to cancel before the renewal date if you don’t want to continue. With a growing slate of original series, award-winning films and a slick interface, Apple TV+ has turned into one of the best streaming services for premium content.

You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options.

          "standfirst": "Paramount+ has launched its latest streaming offer, giving new subscribers two months of access for $6 total through December 2 for Black Friday. With prices rising across other platforms, this short-term deal offers a chance to explore either the Essential or Premium plan and see which fits your viewing habits best. Yes, you can pick either plan and get the $3-per-month deal — of course, that makes the Premium plan the better option in terms of the greater discount. Paramount+ continues to expand its catalog with a mix of current CBS shows, exclusive originals, classic TV and live sports. The service is available in two main tiers: Essential, which includes ads, and Premium, which removes most of them and adds a few key extras like 4K streaming, offline downloads and live CBS access. Both tiers include select Showtime programming, giving subscribers a taste of the premium network’s lineup. The Essential plan provides access to more than 40,000 episodes and movies, along with live coverage of the NFL on CBS and UEFA Champions League matches. It supports up to three simultaneous streams, making it a practical choice for households that share accounts. The Premium plan builds on that by offering ad-free on-demand viewing (with exceptions for live broadcasts), higher-quality playback and the option to watch CBS live in participating regions. Paramount+’s growing library combines new releases with well-known favorites, offering titles from across CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Sports fans get live coverage of key events, while movie watchers can find recent cinema releases from Paramount Pictures joining the lineup throughout the year. The inclusion of Showtime series in both plans adds another layer of variety, with dramas and documentaries available alongside the core Paramount+ content. If you’re keeping an eye on subscription costs, an offer like this is a practical way to test the service without paying full price. It also gives you time to see whether the Essential plan’s ad-supported setup or the Premium tier’s extras are worth the difference. If you’ve been watching your streaming spend as prices go up elsewhere, this deal from Paramount+ offers a well-balanced opportunity to experience both plan levels at a lower cost. Paramount+ is one of the best streaming services thanks to its vast selection of original shows like Star Trek: Discovery, Ink Master and Frasier. If you’re ready to stream big shows and live events without a heavy commitment this Cyber Monday offer is one to keep in mind. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1.

The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1.

Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

          "content": "Paramount+ has launched its latest streaming offer, giving new subscribers two months of access for $6 total through December 2 for Black Friday. With prices rising across other platforms, this short-term deal offers a chance to explore either the Essential or Premium plan and see which fits your viewing habits best. Yes, you can pick either plan and get the $3-per-month deal — of course, that makes the Premium plan the better option in terms of the greater discount. Paramount+ continues to expand its catalog with a mix of current CBS shows, exclusive originals, classic TV and live sports. The service is available in two main tiers: Essential, which includes ads, and Premium, which removes most of them and adds a few key extras like 4K streaming, offline downloads and live CBS access. Both tiers include select Showtime programming, giving subscribers a taste of the premium network’s lineup. The Essential plan provides access to more than 40,000 episodes and movies, along with live coverage of the NFL on CBS and UEFA Champions League matches. It supports up to three simultaneous streams, making it a practical choice for households that share accounts. The Premium plan builds on that by offering ad-free on-demand viewing (with exceptions for live broadcasts), higher-quality playback and the option to watch CBS live in participating regions. Paramount+’s growing library combines new releases with well-known favorites, offering titles from across CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Sports fans get live coverage of key events, while movie watchers can find recent cinema releases from Paramount Pictures joining the lineup throughout the year. The inclusion of Showtime series in both plans adds another layer of variety, with dramas and documentaries available alongside the core Paramount+ content. If you’re keeping an eye on subscription costs, an offer like this is a practical way to test the service without paying full price. It also gives you time to see whether the Essential plan’s ad-supported setup or the Premium tier’s extras are worth the difference. If you’ve been watching your streaming spend as prices go up elsewhere, this deal from Paramount+ offers a well-balanced opportunity to experience both plan levels at a lower cost. Paramount+ is one of the best streaming services thanks to its vast selection of original shows like Star Trek: Discovery, Ink Master and Frasier. If you’re ready to stream big shows and live events without a heavy commitment this Cyber Monday offer is one to keep in mind. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day and Cyber Monday. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $274 (21 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $69 (47 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $422 (30 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $24 (18 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $36 (49 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $38 (30 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $89 (26 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,548 (26 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $422 (30 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $24 (18 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $36 (49 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $38 (30 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $89 (26 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $130 (43 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,548 (26 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

          "standfirst": "The iPad A16 is now on sale for $274 for Black Friday, giving you a chance to pick up Apple’s newest entry-level tablet at a discount. It’s the most affordable iPad in the current lineup, offering quick performance, strong battery life and all the essentials for everyday use. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $274, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

          "title": "AirPods Pro 3 drop to a record-low price in this Black Friday deal",
          "standfirst": "Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 are already shaping up to be one of the most sought-after tech gifts this season, and now you can grab them at a lower price. They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $100 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $69. If you prefer over-ear headphones, select colors of the AirPods Max are down to $400.

          "title": "Sling Orange Day Passes drop to $1 each with this Black Friday streaming deal",
          "standfirst": "Sling TV is one of the best live streaming streaming services out there right now, giving you the option to watch a number of traditional cable channels without the traditional, locked-in price of a cable subscription. For Black Friday, you can save on Sling TV's newly announced $5 Day Passes. That $5 price is the regular cost — for a limited time through November 30, a Day Pass for Sling Orange is only $1 and that includes access to 34 channels like ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3. Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV's interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you're likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sling-orange-day-passes-drop-to-1-each-with-this-black-friday-streaming-deal-231208021.html?src=rss",

Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV's interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you're likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/sling-orange-day-passes-drop-to-1-each-with-this-black-friday-streaming-deal-231208021.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best MagSafe power banks for your iPhone",
          "standfirst": "Whether you were won over by the cameras on the new iPhone 17 or you’re sticking it out with your iPhone 12, having a little extra power around is never a bad thing. The best MagSafe power bank is one that attaches firmly, charges quickly and blends in with your handset — or better yet, adds a handy stand to the mix. Right now, the fastest wireless portable chargers are Qi2 25W-certified, but so far there are only a few of those on the market (and we have our favorite). But speed isn’t everything, looks, features and price factor in as well. We’ve tested more than a dozen portable chargers to help you find the best MagSafe battery you can buy. The best MagSafe power banks for 2025 What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank Choose the right capacity. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery. Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time. Understand MagSafe versus Qi2. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible. Qi2 is a standard from the Wireless Power Consortium (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible. The newest standard, Qi2 25W (also called Qi2.2), bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC says a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger and phone need to be certified to get those speeds) and that aligns with our testing. Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e) support the standard after an update to iOS 26. Remember travel restrictions. You may have seen news reports of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the TSA allows them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries). But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. Southwest, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one. Consider the extra features. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use. Some also have straps to make the bank easier to carry around or fish out of your bag. What about the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery? When Apple introduced the iPhone Air, it announced the new $99 iPhone Air MagSafe Battery in the same breath. It’s now the sole Apple-branded MagSafe power bank — but it only works with the iPhone Air. It’s a pretty divisive battery. In his review of the new phone, Engadget’s Sam Rutherford appreciated that the accessory keeps with the sleekness of the iPhone Air design and liked that it can also charge the new AirPods 3 wirelessly. But Valentina Palladino called out its dismal price-to-capacity ratio. Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim is probably a better bet for all but the most devoted iPhone user. It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness as Apple’s proprietary battery, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper. Other MagSafe batteries we tested Torras MiniMag power bank Among the first results when I search for MagSafe power banks on Amazon is the Torras MiniMag power bank, so I thought I’d check it out. The max wireless charging output is 7.5 watts, but it was actually pretty speedy in refilling an iPhone 15, giving it a little less than 80 percentage points in about two hours. The battery itself recharges a bit slowly, and it’s a bit expensive at its full MSRP of $60, but it comes in pretty colors and if you can catch it on sale, it’s a decent choice. Mophie Powerstation Slim 5K The Mophie Powerstation Slim 5K, too, has a super slim design that nearly disappears into the back of the phone as it charges. It makes excellent use of its 5K capacity, delivering a 90 percent refill to an iPhone 15. But it’s a little more expensive than the our top slim pick, Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim, and the squared off design makes it feel bulkier than it actually is. Neither of those make it a bad choice; the MagSafe battery playing field is just terribly competitive right now. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 10K Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro is Qi2-certified and was only a touch slower than other models in terms of charging speeds, boosting an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to full in about two and a half hours. The feel is premium and the stand is sturdy, but it got quite hot during charging, took overly long to refill itself and is pricer and a bit bulkier than similar models. Baseus Picogo 5K The Picogo 5K from Baseus is teensy but still packs a stand and a 5,000mAh capacity. It’s Qi2-certified and delivered a 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. The slim slab of the Anker Nano battery is sleeker. But that one doesn’t have a stand — so if you want to prop up your phone while it charges, go for this one. MagSafe power banks FAQs What does MagSafe do? MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories. Which iPhones support MagSafe? iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories. The new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W. Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case? In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a MagSafe case and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests. How much power do MagSafe batteries provide? That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts. The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html?src=rss",

This isn't a record low price, but it's extremely close. For the uninitiated, the Echo Spot is a diminutive little speaker/alarm clock hybrid unit. It's a cute little doodad and looks great on a nightstand. The screen is customizable, so it doesn't have to display a clock. It can show song titles, smart home control dashboards, the weather and a lot more. Of course, there are numerous clock faces to choose from. The Spot not only integrates with Amazon's smart assistant Alexa, but it provides access to the newfangled Alexa+. This is a smarter and more conversational version of the iconic smart assistant. Like most modern AI products, it's still working out some bugs. The underlying tech, however, is promising. The speaker is decent enough for the size, though you won't be using it to fuel any house parties. It's a great tool for bedroom-based listening. This version doesn't have a camera, which is actually great news for the privacy conscious. In addition to the Echo Spot, you'll even find Black Friday deals on some of the latest Echo devices that just came out last month. The Echo Dot Max is on sale for $90, the new Echo Studio has dropped to $190 and the latest Echo Show 8 has been discounted to $160.

Cans from a bunch of brands are on sale now, including Beats. One of the best deals from that brand is on the Beats Studio Pro, which is available for a whopping 51 percent off. Grab a pair while they're down to $170; this matches the cost we've seen for the Studio Pro headphones during other peak shopping times earlier this year. The Beats brand last updated this wireless over-ear headset in 2023, but it's still a solid choice for a workhorse pair of headphones. The current model improved audio quality and added a useful Transparency mode, so that you can listen to your tunes and still be aware of the world around you, which is great for settings such as public transit and the gym. The other option is a more immersive active noise-canceling mode. Beats Studio Pro also support lossless audio when wired on a USB-C cable. The official specs say the battery life for the headphones lasts up to 40 hours, or 24 hours when the active noise canceling mode is engaged. If you need to eke more life out of these Beats, they do offer a fast-charging mode that promises four hours of activity from just ten minutes of recharge. There are several color options for the Beats Studio Pro, so if there's a particular hue you want to be sporting, this might be a deal to hop on quickly before the supplies run out or the deal expires. Also on sale in the Beats realm for Black Friday is the Beats Solo 4, which is 35 percent off and down to $130.

Thankfully, there are a ton of early Black Friday deals for the tech lover in your life. Take the 43 percent discount currently available on the 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and Charging Dock. It's a great option for the gamer in your life, and a steal down from $70 to $40 — a new all-time low price. The controller comes with perks such as the charging dock, 22 hours of battery per charge and compatibility with everything from Steam Deck to Switch. The deal is only for the white model. Earlier this year, 8Bitdo released a new version of this $70 controller, aptly called the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. We rated it as one of the best controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2. While the upgraded model brings you features like more precise and sensitive joysticks, this sale brings the original Ultimate Controller back into view — and our shopping carts. Plus, it also works well with the Nintendo Switch 2.

The still-excellent WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones are down to $250, which is the lowest price we've seen them. Yes, the latest model, the XM6, have technically replaced these in Sony's lineup. But if the latest flagships are out of your price range, these former Engadget favorites are well worth considering at this heavily reduced price. We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 review, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t entirely baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are. Naturally, the WH-1000XM6 that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they're on sale now for $398 for Black Friday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you're willing to spend a bit more. However, we still think the XM5 deal is the best value for most people here.

Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 48 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $130. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots. An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's favorite budget robot vacuum, and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging. This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of its last earning statement. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.

If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 47 percent off, bringing it down to just $69 from its usual price of $130. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. Elsewhere when it comes to Black Friday AirPods deals, you can pick up the AirPods 4 with ANC for $100, the new AirPods Pro 3 for $220 and the AirPods Max (in certain colors) for $400.

          "standfirst": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during a discount period like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. On this list, I've gathered the top subscriptions of all sorts you can enjoy this Black Friday, from VPNs that keep you anonymous online to MasterClass deals that continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). On this list, we've gathered the top sales of all kinds of subscriptions. We've got some of the best VPNs to keep you anonymous online, MasterClass deals to continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses, and streaming deals for TV marathons on those long winter nights. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (six months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Six months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-include-huge-savings-on-hbo-max-apple-tv-masterclass-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000935.html?src=rss",
          "content": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during a discount period like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. On this list, I've gathered the top subscriptions of all sorts you can enjoy this Black Friday, from VPNs that keep you anonymous online to MasterClass deals that continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). On this list, we've gathered the top sales of all kinds of subscriptions. We've got some of the best VPNs to keep you anonymous online, MasterClass deals to continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses, and streaming deals for TV marathons on those long winter nights. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (six months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Six months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-include-huge-savings-on-hbo-max-apple-tv-masterclass-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000935.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Ice cream might not be the first dessert that springs to mind in late fall, but there’s no bad season for frozen treats, and our favorite ice cream maker is down to $180 for Black Friday. This kitchen gadget, which scored 90 in our review, is guaranteed to make you popular with guests during the holiday season, and at $50 off its regular price of $250 — the lowest price we’ve seen this year for this particular model — now is a great time to buy. While you’ll definitely need a bit of space to accommodate it, the Creami is a more compact ice cream machine than some of its rivals. It works similarly to a food processor, only here you’ll be using strictly frozen liquid ice cream as a base. Once you have that (you’ll need to give the base around 24 hours in the freezer for the desired consistency) you use Ninja’s machine to blend in your chosen flavors. And if you make a mess (and let’s face it, you probably will), rest assured that most of the components are dishwasher-safe. It’s admittedly a fairly loud machine during use, but as long as you’re willing to put up with the noise, you can choose between seven one-touch programs, including milkshake if you’re in the mood for a cold drink. And if you’re hosting people with allergies, they can be reassured that you have total control about what’s going into and coming out of the machine, which is much harder to guarantee when you’re buying dessert in a restaurant. This model also includes two pint containers with lids. If you want the latest and greatest, though, the Ninja Swirl is the ice-cream maker to get. It can make regular and soft-serve ice cream, plus a number of other frozen treats. Right now, QVC has it for the best price we've seen, from $350 to $280.

          "standfirst": "It's Thanksgiving Day, and if you're a Fubo subscriber, that means you can't watch two of today's biggest TV events: This morning's official Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade broadcast and tonight's NFL matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Baltimore Ravens. And it's all because streaming service Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a tiff. Channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo went dark on Fubo at 5PM ET on November 21, 2025, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there was no progress to announce as of Thursday morning. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering what to do, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. What time does the 2025 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade start? The parade begins today (Thanksgiving morning) at 8:30AM ET/5:30 a.m. PT on NBC and Peacock. There will be an encore broadcast at 2PM ET/PT. When does the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Baltimore Ravens game start? The Bengals vs. Ravens Thanksgiving Day game kicks off at 8:20PM ET/5:20PM PT on Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025. The game will be broadcast on NBC and Peacock. Which channels are no longer available on Fubo? The following is a list of channels owned or operated by NBC that are not currently available on Fubo: Local Channels: NBC Local Affiliates Telemundo Local/National Regional Sports Channels: NBC Sports 4K NBC Sports Bay Area NBC Sports Bay Area Plus NBC Sports Boston NBC Sports California NBC Sports California Plus NBC Sports California Plus 3 NBC Sports Philadelphia NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus National Channels: American Crimes Bravo Bravo Vault Caso Cerrado CNBC CNBC World Cozi Dateline 24/7 E!

Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. When will the missing channels return? There is no information available as to when NBC's lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing. Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, \"If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account.\" At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle. What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime? Looking to switch from Fubo? You've got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices: Watch NBC on Peacock Get a deal on Peacock with Walmart+ Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month Try Hulu + Live TV for free Other services to watch NBC If I switch to a different service, can I cancel or pause Fubo in the meantime? Fubo does not allow customers to pause their subscriptions, so if you're looking to make a change, you can cancel your plan outright.

          "standfirst": "Loads of Anker gear is on sale for Black Friday, and we rounded up the best deals we could find right here. We decided we like Anker so much, it deserves its own roundup. Afterall, the brand makes some of our favorite accessories for keeping phones, tablets and computers charged up and otherwise connected with excellent wireless chargers, MagSafe power banks, iPad accessories and more. Part of why we love this stuff is the affordability — particularly for what you get — but now these Anker Black Friday deals make these buys an even better value. Don’t hesitate to stock up. Anker Black Friday deals: Power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. And we think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Anker Black Friday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Black Friday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Black Friday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Black Friday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands, not just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Black Friday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

Anker Black Friday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Black Friday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Black Friday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Black Friday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands, not just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Black Friday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "Sports fans who want to catch every last game and news junkies who want to watch network news as it unfolds have two main options: cable or a live TV streaming service. Cable or satellite service often requires extra equipment and convoluted contracts. Live TV streaming services only need an internet connection and a smart TV. These plans also used to be cheaper than cable, but rate hikes have put many of them at $85 and above, so the price gap has narrowed. We tested out all the major players to compare what you get and help you make sense of your options. Here are the best live TV streaming services, according to our testing.Editor’s note: The dispute between YouTube TV and Disney, which carried on long enough to cause ABC, ESPN and other Disney properties to go dark on Google’s streaming service, has been resolved and those channels are again available. Fans looking to watch Thanksgiving weekend games will need access to FOX, CBS and NBC as well as Prime Video. We’ve detailed the schedule in the NFL streaming section below. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How to watch Thanksgiving weekend pro football Viewers looking to watch Thanksgiving weekend games will need more than just a live TV streaming service. The three games for Thursday will air on three different networks: the 1PM ET game on Fox, followed by the 4:40PM ET game on CBS, then the 8:20PM ET game on NBC. Any of our top four subscription recommendations — YouTube TV, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV — cover all of those channels. Alternatively, you can catch the Fox game on the company’s new Fox One streaming service or for free on Tubi. The CBS game can be seen on Paramount+ and the NBC game will air on Peacock. For the Black Friday football matchup between the Bears and the Eagles, you’ll need a subscription to Amazon’s Prime Video, which also owns the rights to air (non-Thanksgiving) Thursday night football. Right now, new customers can get a free 30-day trial of the service. There’s no football on Saturday, but Sunday’s eleven games will air on a mix of Fox, CBS and NBC, with many of those games airing at the same time. You’ll be able to watch the games in your market with a live TV streaming service, or the respective traditional streaming service, but you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket package (only available through YouTube TV) to catch them all. Monday night football belongs to ABC/ESPN and you can take advantage of Sling’s $1 day passes which include ESPN to catch the Monday-after-Thanksgiving contest between the Giants and the Patriots. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "content": "Sports fans who want to catch every last game and news junkies who want to watch network news as it unfolds have two main options: cable or a live TV streaming service. Cable or satellite service often requires extra equipment and convoluted contracts. Live TV streaming services only need an internet connection and a smart TV. These plans also used to be cheaper than cable, but rate hikes have put many of them at $85 and above, so the price gap has narrowed. We tested out all the major players to compare what you get and help you make sense of your options. Here are the best live TV streaming services, according to our testing.Editor’s note: The dispute between YouTube TV and Disney, which carried on long enough to cause ABC, ESPN and other Disney properties to go dark on Google’s streaming service, has been resolved and those channels are again available. Fans looking to watch Thanksgiving weekend games will need access to FOX, CBS and NBC as well as Prime Video. We’ve detailed the schedule in the NFL streaming section below. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How to watch Thanksgiving weekend pro football Viewers looking to watch Thanksgiving weekend games will need more than just a live TV streaming service. The three games for Thursday will air on three different networks: the 1PM ET game on Fox, followed by the 4:40PM ET game on CBS, then the 8:20PM ET game on NBC. Any of our top four subscription recommendations — YouTube TV, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV — cover all of those channels. Alternatively, you can catch the Fox game on the company’s new Fox One streaming service or for free on Tubi. The CBS game can be seen on Paramount+ and the NBC game will air on Peacock. For the Black Friday football matchup between the Bears and the Eagles, you’ll need a subscription to Amazon’s Prime Video, which also owns the rights to air (non-Thanksgiving) Thursday night football. Right now, new customers can get a free 30-day trial of the service. There’s no football on Saturday, but Sunday’s eleven games will air on a mix of Fox, CBS and NBC, with many of those games airing at the same time. You’ll be able to watch the games in your market with a live TV streaming service, or the respective traditional streaming service, but you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket package (only available through YouTube TV) to catch them all. Monday night football belongs to ABC/ESPN and you can take advantage of Sling’s $1 day passes which include ESPN to catch the Monday-after-Thanksgiving contest between the Giants and the Patriots. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card.

Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the flagship Apple Watch Series 11, which is $60 off and down to $339. We consider it to be the best smartwatch, period, thanks to its longer battery life, thin and light design, comprehensive health and fitness tracking features and extra perks like gesture control.

          "standfirst": "You don’t have to spend a ton to get your hands on some quality tech, thanks to Black Friday. We’re seeing loads of tech deals for under $50 right now, with some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year. Many of the discounts apply to accessories — the chargers, hubs, cables and drives that play necessary supporting roles for smartphones and laptops — but there are plenty of other small electronics on sale, too. Here we’ve rounded up our recommended smart speakers, earbuds, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers that are seeing notable discounts. This is stuff Engadget has tested and recommend in our guides. We’ve even linked to our coverage so you can read up before you buy. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals we could find. Engadget's top picks under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $12 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is it worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add on to your service.. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Apple TV (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Personally, I think Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+) is the most valuable streaming subscription I pay for. Slow Horses, Severance, Shape Island, The Studio, Murderbot, For All Mankind and, yes, even Ted Lasso are among the best shows on TV of the past few years. That’s before you factor in Pluribus, the new show from the creator of Better Call Saul. I pay full price, but if you’re a new or returning subscriber, you can get the next six months for just $36. The deal ends December 1 and automatically renews unless you cancel. You also have to subscribe directly through Apple, not a third-party service. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.

          "content": "You don’t have to spend a ton to get your hands on some quality tech, thanks to Black Friday. We’re seeing loads of tech deals for under $50 right now, with some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year. Many of the discounts apply to accessories — the chargers, hubs, cables and drives that play necessary supporting roles for smartphones and laptops — but there are plenty of other small electronics on sale, too. Here we’ve rounded up our recommended smart speakers, earbuds, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers that are seeing notable discounts. This is stuff Engadget has tested and recommend in our guides. We’ve even linked to our coverage so you can read up before you buy. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals we could find. Engadget's top picks under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $12 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is it worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add on to your service.. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Apple TV (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Personally, I think Apple TV (formerly Apple TV+) is the most valuable streaming subscription I pay for. Slow Horses, Severance, Shape Island, The Studio, Murderbot, For All Mankind and, yes, even Ted Lasso are among the best shows on TV of the past few years. That’s before you factor in Pluribus, the new show from the creator of Better Call Saul. I pay full price, but if you’re a new or returning subscriber, you can get the next six months for just $36. The deal ends December 1 and automatically renews unless you cancel. You also have to subscribe directly through Apple, not a third-party service. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.

          "standfirst": "Whether you or someone on your gift list has trouble keeping track of their stuff, you can't go wrong by picking up an AirTag for assistance. For Black Friday, you can save on Apple's Bluetooth trackers — a four-pack is on sale for $65 right now at Amazon and Walmart, which is just about the lowest price we've seen. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

          "standfirst": "As with most tech products, Black Friday sales are usually a good time to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’ve weeded out the junk and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could already find. So far we’re seeing discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we’ll update this post as we find more deals that are worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off MSRP): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express Card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want more space for a Switch 2, the 512GB version of Samsung’s P9 Express card is also on sale for a new low of $75. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $190 at Best Buy ($130 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. It’s usually retailed for $250 in recent months. Also at B&H. If you don't want the heatsink, the drive alone is on sale for $10 less. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $750 at Amazon ($250 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Also at Best Buy. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $160 at Amazon ($80 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are on sale as well, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. While this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-ssd-deals-take-up-to-250-off-recommended-internal-and-portable-ssds-microsd-cards-and-more-175429501.html?src=rss",
          "content": "As with most tech products, Black Friday sales are usually a good time to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’ve weeded out the junk and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could already find. So far we’re seeing discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we’ll update this post as we find more deals that are worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off MSRP): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your gaming setup, now’s the time. Samsung’s Odyssey G8 monitor is on sale for $950 for Black Friday, a $350 discount off its regular price. It’s one of the best 32-inch gaming monitors on the market, combining stunning picture quality with ultra-smooth performance. The 32-inch Odyssey G8 has earned high marks for its blend of image quality and gaming performance. Its 4K OLED panel produces deep blacks and bright highlights, with 99 percent DCI-P3 color coverage for vibrant visuals. The 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time deliver exceptional smoothness in fast-paced games, while AMD FreeSync Premium Pro keeps everything tear-free. Design-wise, it’s sleek and minimal, with a slim metal frame that looks just as good in a work setup as it does in a gaming room. The monitor supports DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 inputs, plus USB-C connectivity for charging and data transfer. Built-in speakers and Smart TV features let you stream directly from apps like Netflix or Prime Video without connecting to a PC or console. You also get Samsung’s SmartThings integration, so the Odyssey G8 can double as a smart home hub, controlling compatible IoT devices from lights to thermostats. It even supports cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass and NVIDIA GeForce Now, meaning you can play high-end titles without extra hardware. The combination of OLED contrast, motion clarity and built-in streaming makes it one of the most versatile monitors in Samsung’s lineup. If you want something even larger, the Odyssey G9 is also discounted by $300, bringing the 49-inch curved DQHD model down to $700. It offers a wide field of view and 144Hz refresh rate, making it a great pick for simulation and racing fans. The Odyssey G7 is another strong choice, now $600 after a $300 discount. This 37-inch 4K display runs at 165Hz with a curved design and supports both HDR and AMD FreeSync for smooth gameplay. Finally, Samsung’s Smart Monitor M9 is available for $1,300, $300 off its regular price. It combines 4K OLED visuals with built-in streaming and AI-powered vision tools, making it a good all-rounder for work and entertainment.

While it's possible to do it all yourself, budgeting apps can automate some processes and make it easier to see where your money is going and patterns, both good and bad, that might be occurring. For Black Friday, you can get 50 percent off our favorite budgeting app, Quicken Simplifi. The Quicken Simplifi app is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year. Quicken Classic, the company's \"original desktop software\" for \"experienced investors\" is also half off at $6 monthly, down from $12 monthly. The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. One of the many things that sets Quicken Simplifi apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.

          "standfirst": "The holiday season is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV, and this year looks to be no exception. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find that are already available today. So far the discounts include high-end OLED TVs and well-reviewed budget models from the likes of Samsung, LG, Hisense, Sony and other popular brands. We’ll be updating our roundup through Black Friday itself as more discounts arise. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($750 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal comes within $20 of the best price we've seen for the 48-inch version. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target. Best Black Friday streaming service deals Apple TV 6-month subscription for $36 at Apple ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for $36, which comes out to $6 per month for the discounted period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show or Pluribus for less. The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 at Sling ($4 off): Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's 30-plus channels, including ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-black-friday-tv-deals-for-2025-save-hundreds-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-during-the-biggest-sales-event-of-the-year-181143212.html?src=rss",
          "content": "The holiday season is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV, and this year looks to be no exception. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find that are already available today. So far the discounts include high-end OLED TVs and well-reviewed budget models from the likes of Samsung, LG, Hisense, Sony and other popular brands. We’ll be updating our roundup through Black Friday itself as more discounts arise. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($750 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal comes within $20 of the best price we've seen for the 48-inch version. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E.

This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked.

For Black Friday, you can save on Oura ring models. Arguably the most noteworthy deal is on the Oura Ring 4, the latest model, which is down to $249. The Ring 4 actually topped our list of the best smart rings, and with good reason. It's comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is always nice. It's a visually striking ring.

It keeps an eye on sleep, heart rate, stress, body temperature, menstrual cycle and a whole lot more. The battery lasts around a week, which is always nice when taking a quick vacation. The only downside here, and this applies to all Oura rings, is that many features are locked behind a subscription paywall. This costs $6 a month or $70 per year.

          "title": "The 7 best cordless vacuums for 2025",
          "standfirst": "The vacuum world has gone cordless, untethering us from outlets and saving us fights with pesky wires. Cordless vacuums can be great alternatives to traditional corded models since they’re lightweight and easier to maneuver around your home. They’ve also gotten much more powerful in recent years. Some even come with extra features like app connectivity, self-emptying bases and more. But just like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from now (no, Dyson isn’t your only option).Before you upgrade to a cordless vacuum it’s important to do your research. We at Engadget can help make your decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the most popular cordless vacuum cleaners available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which cordless vacuum is right for you. Table of contents Best cordless vacuums for 2025 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum How we test cordless vacuums Cordless stick vacuums FAQs Best cordless vacuums for 2025 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Dyson Gen 5 Detect The Dyson Gen 5 Detect has a single-button start and stronger suction power than our top pick, but it’s otherwise quite similar. However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year. Levoit Aero The biggest selling point of the Levoit Aero is the attached bin into which the vacuum will empty its dustbin when you press a button once it's docked after a cleaning. I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the \"self\" part isn't really there — instead, there's a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It's convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well. LG CordZero Q3 The $329 CordZero Q3 is a perfectly capable vacuum with a single-button start, two manual power modes, adjustable suction technology that detects carpets and hard flooring and a cleaner head outfitted with LEDs to help you better spot all the dirt on your floors. But it's ultimately just fine in comparison to our top picks; it's not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it's just awkward) and it doesn't have the smoothest handling. Shark Detect Pro The Shark Detect Pro provides a lot of value for the money, but it was ultimately beat by the Tineco Pure One Station 5 for our runner-up slot thanks to the Tineco’s stronger suction power. The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture. Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum Design and bin capacity Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices. Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners. Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session. If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum. Suction and power modes Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power. Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength. Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible. If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs. Floor type The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it's still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet. Battery life Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy. Base style Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby. Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris. “Smart” features Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area. Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the best robot vacuums, or even the best budget robot vacuums, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t need Wi-Fi or an app connectivity. Price Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more. How we test cordless vacuums Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot. Cordless stick vacuums FAQs How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum? Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster. Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones? Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room. Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair? Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing. What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner? Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back. Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh. Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick. Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery? Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.

          "content": "The vacuum world has gone cordless, untethering us from outlets and saving us fights with pesky wires. Cordless vacuums can be great alternatives to traditional corded models since they’re lightweight and easier to maneuver around your home. They’ve also gotten much more powerful in recent years. Some even come with extra features like app connectivity, self-emptying bases and more. But just like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from now (no, Dyson isn’t your only option).Before you upgrade to a cordless vacuum it’s important to do your research. We at Engadget can help make your decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the most popular cordless vacuum cleaners available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which cordless vacuum is right for you. Table of contents Best cordless vacuums for 2025 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum How we test cordless vacuums Cordless stick vacuums FAQs Best cordless vacuums for 2025 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Dyson Gen 5 Detect The Dyson Gen 5 Detect has a single-button start and stronger suction power than our top pick, but it’s otherwise quite similar. However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year. Levoit Aero The biggest selling point of the Levoit Aero is the attached bin into which the vacuum will empty its dustbin when you press a button once it's docked after a cleaning. I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the \"self\" part isn't really there — instead, there's a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It's convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well. LG CordZero Q3 The $329 CordZero Q3 is a perfectly capable vacuum with a single-button start, two manual power modes, adjustable suction technology that detects carpets and hard flooring and a cleaner head outfitted with LEDs to help you better spot all the dirt on your floors. But it's ultimately just fine in comparison to our top picks; it's not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it's just awkward) and it doesn't have the smoothest handling. Shark Detect Pro The Shark Detect Pro provides a lot of value for the money, but it was ultimately beat by the Tineco Pure One Station 5 for our runner-up slot thanks to the Tineco’s stronger suction power. The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture. Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum Design and bin capacity Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices. Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners. Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session. If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum. Suction and power modes Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power. Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength. Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible. If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs. Floor type The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it's still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet. Battery life Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy. Base style Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby. Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris. “Smart” features Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area. Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the best robot vacuums, or even the best budget robot vacuums, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t need Wi-Fi or an app connectivity. Price Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more. How we test cordless vacuums Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur.

          "standfirst": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Read more: The best Black Friday streaming deals for 2025 Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $2 for two months. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Spotify Premium Individual (four months) for $0 ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $2 for two months. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Spotify Premium Individual (four months) for $0 ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

For instance, the Delta Pro 3 is on sale for $2,099. This is a discount of 43 percent, as the typical cost is $3,699. That's a significant drop in price. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,279. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.

          "standfirst": "VentureBeat recently sat down (virtually) with Itamar Golan, co-founder and CEO of Prompt Security, to chat through the GenAI security challenges organizations of all sizes face. We talked about shadow AI sprawl, the strategic decisions that led Golan to pursue building a market-leading platform versus competing on features, and a real-world incident that crystallized why protecting AI applications isn&#x27;t optional anymore. Golan provided an unvarnished view of the company&#x27;s mission to empower enterprises to adopt AI securely, and how that vision led to SentinelOne&#x27;s estimated $250 million acquisition in August 2025.Golan&#x27;s path to founding Prompt Security began with academic work on transformer architectures, well before they became foundational to today&#x27;s large language models. His experience building one of the earliest GenAI-powered security features using GPT-2 and GPT-3 convinced him that LLM-driven applications were creating an entirely new attack surface. He founded Prompt Security in August 2023, raised $23 million across two rounds, built a 50-person team, and achieved a successful exit in under two years.The timing of our conversation couldn’t be better. VentureBeat analysis shows shadow AI now costs enterprises $4.63 million per breach, 16% above average, yet 97% of breached organizations lack basic AI access controls, according to IBM&#x27;s 2025 data. VentureBeat estimates that shadow AI apps could double by mid-2026 based on current 5% monthly growth rates. Cyberhaven data reveals 73.8% of ChatGPT workplace accounts are unauthorized, and enterprise AI usage has grown 61x in just 24 months. As Golan told VentureBeat in previous coverage, \"We see 50 new AI apps a day, and we&#x27;ve already cataloged over 12,000. Around 40% of these default to training on any data you feed them, meaning your intellectual property can become part of their models.\"The following has been edited for clarity and length.VentureBeat: What made you recognize that GenAI security needed a dedicated company when most enterprises were still figuring out how to deploy their first LLMs? Was there a specific moment, customer conversation, or attack pattern you saw that convinced you this was a fundable, venture-scale opportunity?Itamar Golan: From an early age, I was drawn to mathematics, data, and the emerging world of artificial intelligence. That curiosity shaped my academic path, culminating in a study on transformer architectures, well before they became foundational to today&#x27;s large language models. My passion for AI also guided my early career as a data scientist, where my work increasingly intersected with cybersecurity.Everything accelerated with the release of the first OpenAI API. Around that time, as part of my previous job, I teamed up with Lior Drihem, who would later become my co-founder and Prompt Security&#x27;s CTO. Together, we built one of the earliest security features powered by generative AI, using GPT-2 and GPT-3 to generate contextual, actionable remediation steps for security alerts. This reduced the time security teams needed to understand and resolve issues.That experience made it clear that applications powered by GPT-like models were opening an entirely new and vulnerable attack surface. Recognizing this shift, we founded Prompt Security in August 2023 to address these emerging risks. Our goal was to empower organizations to ride this wave of innovation and unleash the potential of AI without it becoming a security and governance nightmare.Prompt Security became known for prompt injection defense, but you were solving a broader set of GenAI security challenges. Walk me through the full scope of what the platform addressed: data leakage, model governance, compliance, red teaming, whatever else. What capabilities ended up resonating most with customers that may have surprised you?From the beginning, we designed Prompt Security to cover a broad range of use cases. Focusing solely on employee monitoring or prompt-injection protection for internal AI applications was never enough. To truly give security teams the confidence to adopt AI safely, we needed to protect every touchpoint across the organization, and do it all at runtime.For many customers, the real turning point was discovering just how many AI tools their employees were already using. Early on, companies often found not just ChatGPT but dozens of unmanaged AI services in active use completely outside IT&#x27;s visibility. That made shadow AI discovery a critical part of our solution.Equally important was real-time sensitive-data sanitization. Instead of blocking AI tools outright, we enabled employees to use them safely by automatically removing sensitive information from prompts before it ever reached an external model. It struck the balance organizations needed: strong security without sacrificing productivity. Employees could keep working with AI, while security teams knew that no sensitive data was leaking out.What surprised many customers was how enabling safe usage — rather than restricting it — drove faster adoption and trust. Once they saw AI as a managed, secure channel instead of a forbidden one, usage exploded responsibly.You built Prompt Security into a market leader. What were the two to three strategic decisions that actually accelerated your growth? Was it focusing on a specific vertical?Looking back, the real acceleration didn&#x27;t come from luck or timing: It came from a few deliberate choices I made early. These choices were uncomfortable, expensive, and slowed us down in the short term, but they created massive leverage over time.First, I chose to build a category, not a feature. From day one, I refused to position Prompt Security as \"just\" protection against prompt injection or data leakage, because I saw that as a dead end. Instead, I framed Prompt as the AI security control layer for the enterprise, the platform that governs how humans, agents, and applications interact with LLMs. That decision was fundamental, allowing us to create a budget instead of fighting for it, sit at the CISO table as a strategic layer rather than a tool, and build platform-level pricing and long-term relevance instead of a narrow point solution. I wasn&#x27;t trying to win a feature race; I was building a new category.Second, I chose enterprise complexity before it was comfortable. While most startups avoid complexity until they&#x27;re forced into it, I did the opposite: I built for enterprise deployment models early, including self-hosted and hybrid; covered real enterprise surfaces like browsers, IDEs, internal tools, MCPs, and agentic workflows; and accepted longer cycles and more complex engineering in exchange for credibility. It wasn&#x27;t the easiest route, but it gave us something competitors couldn&#x27;t fake: enterprise readiness before the market even knew it would need it. Third, I chose depth over logos. Rather than chasing volume or vanity metrics, I went deep with a smaller number of very serious customers, embedding ourselves into how they rolled out AI internally, how they thought about risk, policy, and governance, and how they planned long-term AI adoption. These customers didn&#x27;t just buy the product: they shaped it. That created a product that reflected enterprise reality, produced proof points that moved boardrooms and not just security teams, and built a level of defensibility that came from entrenchment rather than marketing.You were educating the market on threats most CISOs hadn&#x27;t even considered yet. How did your positioning and messaging evolve from year one to the acquisition?In the early days, we were educating a market that was still trying to understand whether AI adoption extended beyond a few employees using ChatGPT for productivity. Our positioning focused heavily on awareness, showing CISOs that AI usage was already sprawling across their organizations and that this created real, immediate risks they hadn&#x27;t accounted for.I wasn&#x27;t trying to win a feature race; I was building a new category.As the market matured, our messaging shifted from \"this is happening\" to \"here&#x27;s how you stay ahead.\" CISOs now fully recognize the scale of AI sprawl and know that simple URL filtering or basic controls won&#x27;t suffice. Instead of debating the problem, they&#x27;re looking for a way to enable safe AI use without the operational burden of tracking every new tool, site, copilot, or AI agent employees discover.By the time of the acquisition, our positioning centered on being the safe enabler: a solution that delivers visibility, protection, and governance at the speed of AI innovation.Our research shows that enterprises are struggling to get approvals from senior management to deploy GenAI security tools. How are security departments persuading their C-level executives to move forward?The most successful CISOs are framing GenAI security as a natural extension of existing data protection mandates, not an experimental budget line. They position it as protecting the same assets, corporate data, IP, and user trust, in a new, rapidly growing channel.What&#x27;s the most serious GenAI security incident or near-miss you encountered while building Prompt Security that really drove home how critical these protections are? How did that incident shape your product roadmap or go-to-market approach?The moment that crystallized everything for me happened with a large, highly regulated company that launched a customer-facing GenAI support agent. This wasn&#x27;t a sloppy experiment. They had everything the security textbooks recommend: WAF, CSPM, shift-left, regular red teaming, a secure SDLC, the works. On paper, they were doing everything right.What they didn&#x27;t fully account for was that the AI agent itself had become a new, exposed attack surface. Within weeks of launch, a non-technical user discovered that by carefully crafting the right conversation flow (not code, not exploits, just natural language) they could prompt-inject the agent into revealing information from other customers&#x27; support tickets and internal case summaries. It wasn&#x27;t a nation-state attacker. It wasn&#x27;t someone with advanced skills. It was essentially a curious user with time and creativity. And yet, through that single conversational interface, they managed to access some of the most sensitive customer data the company holds.It was both fascinating and terrifying: realizing how creativity alone could become an exploit vector.That was the moment I truly understood what GenAI changes about the threat model. AI doesn&#x27;t just introduce new risks, it democratizes them. It makes systems hackable by people who never had the skill set before, compresses the time it takes to discover exploits, and massively expands the damage radius once something breaks. That incident validated our original approach, and it pushed us to double down on protecting AI applications, not just internal use. We accelerated work around:• Runtime protection for customer-facing AI apps• Prompt injection and context manipulation detection• Cross-tenant data leakage prevention at the model interaction layerIt also reshaped our go-to-market. Instead of only talking about internal AI governance, we began showing security leaders how GenAI turns their customer-facing surfaces into high-risk, high-exposure assets overnight. What&#x27;s your role and focus now that you&#x27;re part of SentinelOne? How has operating inside a larger platform company changed what you&#x27;re able to build compared to running an independent startup? What got easier, and what got harder?The focus now is on extending AI security across the entire platform, bringing runtime GenAI protection, visibility, and policy enforcement into the same ecosystem that already secures endpoints, identities, and cloud workloads. The mission hasn&#x27;t changed; the reach has.Ultimately, we&#x27;re building toward a future where AI itself becomes part of the defense fabric: not just something to secure, but something that secures you.The bigger pictureM&A activity continues to accelerate for GenAI startups that have proven they can scale to enterprise-level security without sacrificing accuracy or speed. Palo Alto Networks paid $700 million for Protect AI. Tenable acquired Apex for $100 million. Cisco bought Robust Intelligence for a reported $500 million. As Golan noted, the companies that survive the next wave of AI-enabled attacks will be those that embedded security into their AI adoption strategy from the beginning.Post-acquisition, Prompt Security&#x27;s capabilities will extend across SentinelOne&#x27;s Singularity Platform, including MCP gateway security between AI applications and more than 13,000 known MCP servers. Prompt Security is also delivering model-agnostic coverage across all major LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, as well as self-hosted or on-prem models as part of the company&#x27;s integration into the Singularity Platform.",

Early on, companies often found not just ChatGPT but dozens of unmanaged AI services in active use completely outside IT&#x27;s visibility. That made shadow AI discovery a critical part of our solution.Equally important was real-time sensitive-data sanitization. Instead of blocking AI tools outright, we enabled employees to use them safely by automatically removing sensitive information from prompts before it ever reached an external model. It struck the balance organizations needed: strong security without sacrificing productivity. Employees could keep working with AI, while security teams knew that no sensitive data was leaking out.What surprised many customers was how enabling safe usage — rather than restricting it — drove faster adoption and trust. Once they saw AI as a managed, secure channel instead of a forbidden one, usage exploded responsibly.You built Prompt Security into a market leader. What were the two to three strategic decisions that actually accelerated your growth? Was it focusing on a specific vertical?Looking back, the real acceleration didn&#x27;t come from luck or timing: It came from a few deliberate choices I made early. These choices were uncomfortable, expensive, and slowed us down in the short term, but they created massive leverage over time.First, I chose to build a category, not a feature. From day one, I refused to position Prompt Security as \"just\" protection against prompt injection or data leakage, because I saw that as a dead end. Instead, I framed Prompt as the AI security control layer for the enterprise, the platform that governs how humans, agents, and applications interact with LLMs. That decision was fundamental, allowing us to create a budget instead of fighting for it, sit at the CISO table as a strategic layer rather than a tool, and build platform-level pricing and long-term relevance instead of a narrow point solution. I wasn&#x27;t trying to win a feature race; I was building a new category.Second, I chose enterprise complexity before it was comfortable. While most startups avoid complexity until they&#x27;re forced into it, I did the opposite: I built for enterprise deployment models early, including self-hosted and hybrid; covered real enterprise surfaces like browsers, IDEs, internal tools, MCPs, and agentic workflows; and accepted longer cycles and more complex engineering in exchange for credibility. It wasn&#x27;t the easiest route, but it gave us something competitors couldn&#x27;t fake: enterprise readiness before the market even knew it would need it. Third, I chose depth over logos. Rather than chasing volume or vanity metrics, I went deep with a smaller number of very serious customers, embedding ourselves into how they rolled out AI internally, how they thought about risk, policy, and governance, and how they planned long-term AI adoption. These customers didn&#x27;t just buy the product: they shaped it. That created a product that reflected enterprise reality, produced proof points that moved boardrooms and not just security teams, and built a level of defensibility that came from entrenchment rather than marketing.You were educating the market on threats most CISOs hadn&#x27;t even considered yet. How did your positioning and messaging evolve from year one to the acquisition?In the early days, we were educating a market that was still trying to understand whether AI adoption extended beyond a few employees using ChatGPT for productivity. Our positioning focused heavily on awareness, showing CISOs that AI usage was already sprawling across their organizations and that this created real, immediate risks they hadn&#x27;t accounted for.I wasn&#x27;t trying to win a feature race; I was building a new category.As the market matured, our messaging shifted from \"this is happening\" to \"here&#x27;s how you stay ahead.\" CISOs now fully recognize the scale of AI sprawl and know that simple URL filtering or basic controls won&#x27;t suffice. Instead of debating the problem, they&#x27;re looking for a way to enable safe AI use without the operational burden of tracking every new tool, site, copilot, or AI agent employees discover.By the time of the acquisition, our positioning centered on being the safe enabler: a solution that delivers visibility, protection, and governance at the speed of AI innovation.Our research shows that enterprises are struggling to get approvals from senior management to deploy GenAI security tools. How are security departments persuading their C-level executives to move forward?The most successful CISOs are framing GenAI security as a natural extension of existing data protection mandates, not an experimental budget line. They position it as protecting the same assets, corporate data, IP, and user trust, in a new, rapidly growing channel.What&#x27;s the most serious GenAI security incident or near-miss you encountered while building Prompt Security that really drove home how critical these protections are? How did that incident shape your product roadmap or go-to-market approach?The moment that crystallized everything for me happened with a large, highly regulated company that launched a customer-facing GenAI support agent. This wasn&#x27;t a sloppy experiment. They had everything the security textbooks recommend: WAF, CSPM, shift-left, regular red teaming, a secure SDLC, the works. On paper, they were doing everything right.What they didn&#x27;t fully account for was that the AI agent itself had become a new, exposed attack surface. Within weeks of launch, a non-technical user discovered that by carefully crafting the right conversation flow (not code, not exploits, just natural language) they could prompt-inject the agent into revealing information from other customers&#x27; support tickets and internal case summaries. It wasn&#x27;t a nation-state attacker. It wasn&#x27;t someone with advanced skills. It was essentially a curious user with time and creativity. And yet, through that single conversational interface, they managed to access some of the most sensitive customer data the company holds.It was both fascinating and terrifying: realizing how creativity alone could become an exploit vector.That was the moment I truly understood what GenAI changes about the threat model. AI doesn&#x27;t just introduce new risks, it democratizes them. It makes systems hackable by people who never had the skill set before, compresses the time it takes to discover exploits, and massively expands the damage radius once something breaks. That incident validated our original approach, and it pushed us to double down on protecting AI applications, not just internal use. We accelerated work around:• Runtime protection for customer-facing AI apps• Prompt injection and context manipulation detection• Cross-tenant data leakage prevention at the model interaction layerIt also reshaped our go-to-market. Instead of only talking about internal AI governance, we began showing security leaders how GenAI turns their customer-facing surfaces into high-risk, high-exposure assets overnight. What&#x27;s your role and focus now that you&#x27;re part of SentinelOne? How has operating inside a larger platform company changed what you&#x27;re able to build compared to running an independent startup? What got easier, and what got harder?The focus now is on extending AI security across the entire platform, bringing runtime GenAI protection, visibility, and policy enforcement into the same ecosystem that already secures endpoints, identities, and cloud workloads. The mission hasn&#x27;t changed; the reach has.Ultimately, we&#x27;re building toward a future where AI itself becomes part of the defense fabric: not just something to secure, but something that secures you.The bigger pictureM&A activity continues to accelerate for GenAI startups that have proven they can scale to enterprise-level security without sacrificing accuracy or speed. Palo Alto Networks paid $700 million for Protect AI. Tenable acquired Apex for $100 million. Cisco bought Robust Intelligence for a reported $500 million. As Golan noted, the companies that survive the next wave of AI-enabled attacks will be those that embedded security into their AI adoption strategy from the beginning.Post-acquisition, Prompt Security&#x27;s capabilities will extend across SentinelOne&#x27;s Singularity Platform, including MCP gateway security between AI applications and more than 13,000 known MCP servers. Prompt Security is also delivering model-agnostic coverage across all major LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, as well as self-hosted or on-prem models as part of the company&#x27;s integration into the Singularity Platform.",

          "standfirst": "This weekend, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, decided he wanted to read a book. But he did not want to read it alone. He wanted to read it accompanied by a committee of artificial intelligences, each offering its own perspective, critiquing the others, and eventually synthesizing a final answer under the guidance of a \"Chairman.\"To make this happen, Karpathy wrote what he called a \"vibe code project\" — a piece of software written quickly, largely by AI assistants, intended for fun rather than function. He posted the result, a repository called \"LLM Council,\" to GitHub with a stark disclaimer: \"I’m not going to support it in any way... Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over.\"Yet, for technical decision-makers across the enterprise landscape, looking past the casual disclaimer reveals something far more significant than a weekend toy. In a few hundred lines of Python and JavaScript, Karpathy has sketched a reference architecture for the most critical, undefined layer of the modern software stack: the orchestration middleware sitting between corporate applications and the volatile market of AI models.As companies finalize their platform investments for 2026, LLM Council offers a stripped-down look at the \"build vs. buy\" reality of AI infrastructure. It demonstrates that while the logic of routing and aggregating AI models is surprisingly simple, the operational wrapper required to make it enterprise-ready is where the true complexity lies.How the LLM Council works: Four AI models debate, critique, and synthesize answersTo the casual observer, the LLM Council web application looks almost identical to ChatGPT. A user types a query into a chat box. But behind the scenes, the application triggers a sophisticated, three-stage workflow that mirrors how human decision-making bodies operate.First, the system dispatches the user’s query to a panel of frontier models. In Karpathy’s default configuration, this includes OpenAI’s GPT-5.1, Google’s Gemini 3.0 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, and xAI’s Grok 4. These models generate their initial responses in parallel.In the second stage, the software performs a peer review. Each model is fed the anonymized responses of its counterparts and asked to evaluate them based on accuracy and insight. This step transforms the AI from a generator into a critic, forcing a layer of quality control that is rare in standard chatbot interactions.Finally, a designated \"Chairman LLM\" — currently configured as Google’s Gemini 3 — receives the original query, the individual responses, and the peer rankings. It synthesizes this mass of context into a single, authoritative answer for the user.Karpathy noted that the results were often surprising. \"Quite often, the models are surprisingly willing to select another LLM&#x27;s response as superior to their own,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). He described using the tool to read book chapters, observing that the models consistently praised GPT-5.1 as the most insightful while rating Claude the lowest. However, Karpathy’s own qualitative assessment diverged from his digital council; he found GPT-5.1 \"too wordy\" and preferred the \"condensed and processed\" output of Gemini.FastAPI, OpenRouter, and the case for treating frontier models as swappable componentsFor CTOs and platform architects, the value of LLM Council lies not in its literary criticism, but in its construction. The repository serves as a primary document showing exactly what a modern, minimal AI stack looks like in late 2025.The application is built on a \"thin\" architecture. The backend uses FastAPI, a modern Python framework, while the frontend is a standard React application built with Vite. Data storage is handled not by a complex database, but by simple JSON files written to the local disk.The linchpin of the entire operation is OpenRouter, an API aggregator that normalizes the differences between various model providers. By routing requests through this single broker, Karpathy avoided writing separate integration code for OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. The application does not know or care which company provides the intelligence; it simply sends a prompt and awaits a response.This design choice highlights a growing trend in enterprise architecture: the commoditization of the model layer. By treating frontier models as interchangeable components that can be swapped by editing a single line in a configuration file — specifically the COUNCIL_MODELS list in the backend code — the architecture protects the application from vendor lock-in. If a new model from Meta or Mistral tops the leaderboards next week, it can be added to the council in seconds.What&#x27;s missing from prototype to production: Authentication, PII redaction, and complianceWhile the core logic of LLM Council is elegant, it also serves as a stark illustration of the gap between a \"weekend hack\" and a production system. For an enterprise platform team, cloning Karpathy’s repository is merely step one of a marathon.A technical audit of the code reveals the missing \"boring\" infrastructure that commercial vendors sell for premium prices. The system lacks authentication; anyone with access to the web interface can query the models. There is no concept of user roles, meaning a junior developer has the same access rights as the CIO.Furthermore, the governance layer is nonexistent. In a corporate environment, sending data to four different external AI providers simultaneously triggers immediate compliance concerns. There is no mechanism here to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before it leaves the local network, nor is there an audit log to track who asked what.Reliability is another open question. The system assumes the OpenRouter API is always up and that the models will respond in a timely fashion. It lacks the circuit breakers, fallback strategies, and retry logic that keep business-critical applications running when a provider suffers an outage.These absences are not flaws in Karpathy’s code — he explicitly stated he does not intend to support or improve the project — but they define the value proposition for the commercial AI infrastructure market.Companies like LangChain, AWS Bedrock, and various AI gateway startups are essentially selling the \"hardening\" around the core logic that Karpathy demonstrated. They provide the security, observability, and compliance wrappers that turn a raw orchestration script into a viable enterprise platform.Why Karpathy believes code is now \"ephemeral\" and traditional software libraries are obsoletePerhaps the most provocative aspect of the project is the philosophy under which it was built. Karpathy described the development process as \"99% vibe-coded,\" implying he relied heavily on AI assistants to generate the code rather than writing it line-by-line himself.\"Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like,\" he wrote in the repository’s documentation.This statement marks a radical shift in software engineering capability. Traditionally, companies build internal libraries and abstractions to manage complexity, maintaining them for years. Karpathy is suggesting a future where code is treated as \"promptable scaffolding\" — disposable, easily rewritten by AI, and not meant to last.For enterprise decision-makers, this poses a difficult strategic question. If internal tools can be \"vibe coded\" in a weekend, does it make sense to buy expensive, rigid software suites for internal workflows? Or should platform teams empower their engineers to generate custom, disposable tools that fit their exact needs for a fraction of the cost?When AI models judge AI: The dangerous gap between machine preferences and human needsBeyond the architecture, the LLM Council project inadvertently shines a light on a specific risk in automated AI deployment: the divergence between human and machine judgment.Karpathy’s observation that his models preferred GPT-5.1, while he preferred Gemini, suggests that AI models may have shared biases. They might favor verbosity, specific formatting, or rhetorical confidence that does not necessarily align with human business needs for brevity and accuracy.As enterprises increasingly rely on \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems to evaluate the quality of their customer-facing bots, this discrepancy matters. If the automated evaluator consistently rewards \"wordy and sprawled\" answers while human customers want concise solutions, the metrics will show success while customer satisfaction plummets. Karpathy’s experiment suggests that relying solely on AI to grade AI is a strategy fraught with hidden alignment issues.What enterprise platform teams can learn from a weekend hack before building their 2026 stackUltimately, LLM Council acts as a Rorschach test for the AI industry. For the hobbyist, it is a fun way to read books. For the vendor, it is a threat, proving that the core functionality of their products can be replicated in a few hundred lines of code.But for the enterprise technology leader, it is a reference architecture. It demystifies the orchestration layer, showing that the technical challenge is not in routing the prompts, but in governing the data.As platform teams head into 2026, many will likely find themselves staring at Karpathy’s code, not to deploy it, but to understand it.

          "title": "Black Forest Labs launches Flux.2 AI image models to challenge Nano Banana Pro and Midjourney",
          "standfirst": "It&#x27;s not just Google&#x27;s Gemini 3, Nano Banana Pro, and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 we have to be thankful for this year around the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S.No, today the German AI startup Black Forest Labs released FLUX.2, a new image generation and editing system complete with four different models designed to support production-grade creative workflows.FLUX.2 introduces multi-reference conditioning, higher-fidelity outputs, and improved text rendering, and it expands the company’s open-core ecosystem with both commercial endpoints and open-weight checkpoints. While Black Forest Labs previously launched with and made a name for itself on open source text-to-image models in its Flux family, today&#x27;s release includes one fully open-source component: the Flux.2 VAE, available now under the Apache 2.0 license.Four other models of varying size and uses — Flux.2 [Pro], Flux.2 [Flex], and Flux.2 [Dev] —are not open source; Pro and Flex remain proprietary hosted offerings, while Dev is an open-weight downloadable model that requires a commercial license obtained directly from Black Forest Labs for any commercial use. An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows. Standardizing on a transparent, Apache-licensed VAE supports auditability and compliance requirements, ensures consistent reconstruction quality across internal assets, and allows future models trained for the same latent space to function as drop-in replacements.This transparency also enables downstream customization such as lightweight fine-tuning for brand styles or internal visual templates—even for organizations that do not specialize in media but rely on consistent, controllable image generation for marketing materials, product imagery, documentation, or stock-style visuals. The announcement positions FLUX.2 as an evolution of the FLUX.1 family, with an emphasis on reliability, controllability, and integration into existing creative pipelines rather than one-off demos.A Shift Toward Production-Centric Image ModelsFLUX.2 extends the prior FLUX.1 architecture with more consistent character, layout, and style adherence across up to ten reference images. The system maintains coherence at 4-megapixel resolutions for both generation and editing tasks, enabling use cases such as product visualization, brand-aligned asset creation, and structured design workflows. The model also improves prompt following across multi-part instructions while reducing failure modes related to lighting, spatial logic, and world knowledge.In parallel, Black Forest Labs continues to follow an open-core release strategy. The company provides hosted, performance-optimized versions of FLUX.2 for commercial deployments, while also publishing inspectable open-weight models that researchers and independent developers can run locally. This approach extends a track record begun with FLUX.1, which became the most widely used open image model globally.Model Variants and Deployment OptionsFlux.2 arrives with 5 variants as follows:Flux.2 [Pro]: This is the highest-performance tier, intended for applications that require minimal latency and maximal visual fidelity. It is available through the BFL Playground, the FLUX API, and partner platforms. The model aims to match leading closed-weight systems in prompt adherence and image quality while reducing compute demand.Flux.2 [Flex]: This version exposes parameters such as the number of sampling steps and the guidance scale. The design enables developers to tune the trade-offs between speed, text accuracy, and detail fidelity. In practice, this enables workflows where low-step previews can be generated quickly before higher-step renders are invoked.Flux.2 [Dev]: The most notable release for the open ecosystem is the 32-billion-parameter open-weight checkpoint which integrates text-to-image generation and image editing into a single model. It supports multi-reference conditioning without requiring separate modules or pipelines. The model can run locally using BFL’s reference inference code or optimized fp8 implementations developed in partnership with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. Hosted inference is also available via FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, and DeepInfra.Flux.2 [Klein]: Coming soon, this size-distilled model is released under Apache 2.0 and is intended to offer improved performance relative to comparable models of the same size trained from scratch. A beta program is currently open.Flux.2 – VAE: Released under the enterprise friendly (even for commercial use) Apache 2.0 license, updated variational autoencoder provides the latent space that underpins all Flux.2 variants. The VAE emphasizes an optimized balance between reconstruction fidelity, learnability, and compression rate—a long-standing challenge for latent-space generative architectures. Benchmark PerformanceBlack Forest Labs published two sets of evaluations highlighting FLUX.2’s performance relative to other open-weight and hosted image-generation models. In head-to-head win-rate comparisons across three categories—text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing—FLUX.2 [Dev] led all open-weight alternatives by a substantial margin. It achieved a 66.6% win rate in text-to-image generation (vs. 51.3% for Qwen-Image and 48.1% for Hunyuan Image 3.0), 59.8% in single-reference editing (vs. 49.3% for Qwen-Image and 41.2% for FLUX.1 Kontext), and 63.6% in multi-reference editing (vs. 36.4% for Qwen-Image). These results reflect consistent gains over both earlier FLUX.1 models and contemporary open-weight systems.A second benchmark compared model quality using ELO scores against approximate per-image cost. In this analysis, FLUX.2 [Pro], FLUX.2 [Flex], and FLUX.2 [Dev] cluster in the upper-quality, lower-cost region of the chart, with ELO scores in the ~1030–1050 band while operating in the 2–6 cent range. By contrast, earlier models such as FLUX.1 Kontext [max] and Hunyuan Image 3.0 appear significantly lower on the ELO axis despite similar or higher per-image costs. Only proprietary competitors like Nano Banana 2 reach higher ELO levels, but at noticeably elevated cost. According to BFL, this positions FLUX.2’s variants as offering strong quality–cost efficiency across performance tiers, with FLUX.2 [Dev] in particular delivering near–top-tier quality while remaining one of the lowest-cost options in its class.Pricing via API and Comparison to Nano Banana ProA pricing calculator on BFL’s site indicates that FLUX.2 [Pro] is billed at roughly $0.03 per megapixel of combined input and output. A standard 1024×1024 (1 MP) generation costs $0.030, and higher resolutions scale proportionally. The calculator also counts input images toward total megapixels, suggesting that multi-image reference workflows will have higher per-call costs.By contrast, Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview aka \"Nano Banana Pro,\" currently prices image output at $120 per 1M tokens, resulting in a cost of $0.134 per 1K–2K image (up to 2048×2048) and $0.24 per 4K image. Image input is billed at $0.0011 per image, which is negligible compared to output costs. While Gemini’s model uses token-based billing, its effective per-image pricing places 1K–2K images at more than 4× the cost of a 1 MP FLUX.2 [Pro] generation, and 4K outputs at roughly 8× the cost of a similar-resolution FLUX.2 output if scaled proportionally.In practical terms, the available data suggests that FLUX.2 [Pro] currently offers significantly lower per-image pricing, particularly for high-resolution outputs or multi-image editing workflows, whereas Gemini 3 Pro’s preview tier is positioned as a higher-cost, token-metered service with more variability depending on resolution.Technical Design and the Latent Space OverhaulFLUX.2 is built on a latent flow matching architecture, combining a rectified flow transformer with a vision-language model based on Mistral-3 (24B). The VLM contributes semantic grounding and contextual understanding, while the transformer handles spatial structure, material representation, and lighting behavior.A major component of the update is the re-training of the model’s latent space. The FLUX.2 VAE integrates advances in semantic alignment, reconstruction quality, and representational learnability drawn from recent research on autoencoder optimization. Earlier models often faced trade-offs in the learnability–quality–compression triad: highly compressed spaces increase training efficiency but degrade reconstructions, while wider bottlenecks can reduce the ability of generative models to learn consistent transformations.According to BFL’s research data, the FLUX.2 VAE achieves lower LPIPS distortion than the FLUX.1 and SD autoencoders while also improving generative FID. This balance allows FLUX.2 to support high-fidelity editing—an area that typically demands reconstruction accuracy—and still maintain competitive learnability for large-scale generative training.Capabilities Across Creative WorkflowsThe most significant functional upgrade is multi-reference support. FLUX.2 can ingest up to ten reference images and maintain identity, product details, or stylistic elements across the output. This feature is relevant for commercial applications such as merchandising, virtual photography, storyboarding, and branded campaign development.The system’s typography improvements address a persistent challenge for diffusion- and flow-based architectures. FLUX.2 is able to generate legible fine text, structured layouts, UI elements, and infographic-style assets with greater reliability. This capability, combined with flexible aspect ratios and high-resolution editing, broadens the use cases where text and image jointly define the final output.FLUX.2 enhances instruction following for multi-step, compositional prompts, enabling more predictable outcomes in constrained workflows. The model exhibits better grounding in physical attributes—such as lighting and material behavior—reducing inconsistencies in scenes requiring photoreal equilibrium.Ecosystem and Open-Core StrategyBlack Forest Labs continues to position its models within an ecosystem that blends open research with commercial reliability. The FLUX.1 open models helped establish the company’s reach across both the developer and enterprise markets, and FLUX.2 expands this structure: tightly optimized commercial endpoints for production deployments and open, composable checkpoints for research and community experimentation.The company emphasizes transparency through published inference code, open-weight VAE release, prompting guides, and detailed architectural documentation. It also continues to recruit talent in Freiburg and San Francisco as it pursues a longer-term roadmap toward multimodal models that unify perception, memory, reasoning, and generation.Background: Flux and the Formation of Black Forest LabsBlack Forest Labs (BFL) was founded in 2024 by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, the original creators of Stable Diffusion. Their move from Stability AI came at a moment of turbulence for the broader open-source generative AI community, and the launch of BFL signaled a renewed effort to build accessible, high-performance image models. The company secured $31 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with additional support from Brendan Iribe, Michael Ovitz, and Garry Tan, providing early validation for its technical direction.BFL’s first major release, FLUX.1, introduced a 12-billion-parameter architecture available in Pro, Dev, and Schnell variants. It quickly gained a reputation for output quality that matched or exceeded closed-source competitors such as Midjourney v6 and DALL·E 3, while the Dev and Schnell versions reinforced the company’s commitment to open distribution. FLUX.1 also saw rapid adoption in downstream products, including xAI’s Grok 2, and arrived amid ongoing industry discussions about dataset transparency, responsible model usage, and the role of open-source distribution. BFL published strict usage policies aimed at preventing misuse and non-consensual content generation.In late 2024, BFL expanded the lineup with Flux 1.1 Pro, a proprietary high-speed model delivering sixfold generation speed improvements and achieving leading ELO scores on Artificial Analysis. The company launched a paid API alongside the release, enabling configurable integrations with adjustable resolution, model choice, and moderation settings at pricing that began at $0.04 per image. Partnerships with TogetherAI, Replicate, FAL, and Freepik broadened access and made the model available to users without the need for self-hosting, extending BFL’s reach across commercial and creator-oriented platforms.These developments unfolded against a backdrop of accelerating competition in generative media.Implications for Enterprise Technical Decision MakersThe FLUX.2 release carries distinct operational implications for enterprise teams responsible for AI engineering, orchestration, data management, and security. For AI engineers responsible for model lifecycle management, the availability of both hosted endpoints and open-weight checkpoints enables flexible integration paths. FLUX.2’s multi-reference capabilities and expanded resolution support reduce the need for bespoke fine-tuning pipelines when handling brand-specific or identity-consistent outputs, lowering development overhead and accelerating deployment timelines. The model’s improved prompt adherence and typography performance also reduce iterative prompting cycles, which can have a measurable impact on production workload efficiency.Teams focused on AI orchestration and operational scaling benefit from the structure of FLUX.2’s product family. The Pro tier offers predictable latency characteristics suitable for pipeline-critical workloads, while the Flex tier enables direct control over sampling steps and guidance parameters, aligning with environments that require strict performance tuning. Open-weight access for the Dev model facilitates the creation of custom containerized deployments and allows orchestration platforms to manage the model under existing CI/CD practices. This is particularly relevant for organizations balancing cutting-edge tooling with budget constraints, as self-hosted deployments offer cost control at the expense of in-house optimization requirements.Data engineering stakeholders gain advantages from the model’s latent architecture and improved reconstruction fidelity. High-quality, predictable image representations reduce downstream data-cleaning burdens in workflows where generated assets feed into analytics systems, creative automation pipelines, or multimodal model development.Because FLUX.2 consolidates text-to-image and image-editing functions into a single model, it simplifies integration points and reduces the complexity of data flows across storage, versioning, and monitoring layers. For teams managing large volumes of reference imagery, the ability to incorporate up to ten inputs per generation may also streamline asset management processes by shifting more variation handling into the model rather than external tooling.For security teams, FLUX.2’s open-core approach introduces considerations related to access control, model governance, and API usage monitoring. Hosted FLUX.2 endpoints allow for centralized enforcement of security policies and reduce local exposure to model weights, which may be preferable for organizations with stricter compliance requirements. Conversely, open-weight deployments require internal controls for model integrity, version tracking, and inference-time monitoring to prevent misuse or unapproved modifications. The model’s handling of typography and realistic compositions also reinforces the need for established content governance frameworks, particularly where generative systems interface with public-facing channels.Across these roles, FLUX.2’s design emphasizes predictable performance characteristics, modular deployment options, and reduced operational friction. For enterprises with lean teams or rapidly evolving requirements, the release offers a set of capabilities aligned with practical constraints around speed, quality, budget, and model governance.FLUX.2 marks a substantial iterative improvement in Black Forest Labs’ generative image stack, with notable gains in multi-reference consistency, text rendering, latent space quality, and structured prompt adherence. By pairing fully managed offerings with open-weight checkpoints, BFL maintains its open-core model while extending its relevance to commercial creative workflows. The release demonstrates a shift from experimental image generation toward more predictable, scalable, and controllable systems suited for operational use.",
          "content": "It&#x27;s not just Google&#x27;s Gemini 3, Nano Banana Pro, and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 we have to be thankful for this year around the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S.No, today the German AI startup Black Forest Labs released FLUX.2, a new image generation and editing system complete with four different models designed to support production-grade creative workflows.FLUX.2 introduces multi-reference conditioning, higher-fidelity outputs, and improved text rendering, and it expands the company’s open-core ecosystem with both commercial endpoints and open-weight checkpoints. While Black Forest Labs previously launched with and made a name for itself on open source text-to-image models in its Flux family, today&#x27;s release includes one fully open-source component: the Flux.2 VAE, available now under the Apache 2.0 license.Four other models of varying size and uses — Flux.2 [Pro], Flux.2 [Flex], and Flux.2 [Dev] —are not open source; Pro and Flex remain proprietary hosted offerings, while Dev is an open-weight downloadable model that requires a commercial license obtained directly from Black Forest Labs for any commercial use. An upcoming open-source model is Flux.2 [Klein], which will also be released under Apache 2.0 when available. But the open source Flux.2 VAE, or variational autoencoder, is important and useful to enterprises for several reasons. This is a module that compresses images into a latent space and reconstructs them back into high-resolution outputs; in Flux.2, it defines the latent representation used across the multiple (four total, see blow) model variants, enabling higher-quality reconstructions, more efficient training, and 4-megapixel editing. Because this VAE is open and freely usable, enterprises can adopt the same latent space used by BFL’s commercial models in their own self-hosted pipelines, gaining interoperability between internal systems and external providers while avoiding vendor lock-in.The availability of a fully open, standardized latent space also enables practical benefits beyond media-focused organizations. Enterprises can use an open-source VAE as a stable, shared foundation for multiple image-generation models, allowing them to switch or mix generators without reworking downstream tools or workflows.

Tory Bruno, ULA’s chief executive, told reporters the company would launch as many as 20 missions this year, with roughly an even split between the legacy Atlas V launcher and its replacement—the Vulcan rocket. Now, it’s likely that ULA will close out 2025 with six flights—five with the Atlas V and just one with the Vulcan rocket the company is so eager accelerate into service. Six flights would make 2025 the busiest launch year for ULA since 2022, but it falls well short of the company’s forecast. Last week, ULA announced its next launch is scheduled for December 15. An Atlas V will loft another batch of broadband satellites for the Amazon Leo network, formerly known as Project Kuiper, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. This will be ULA’s last launch of the year.Read full article Comments",

And, early in the year, demand for electricity had surged by nearly 5 percent compared to the year prior, suggesting the grid might truly be facing a data center apocalypse. And that rise in demand had a very unfortunate effect: Coal use rose for the first time since its recent collapse began. But since the first-quarter data was released, demand has steadily eroded. As of yesterday’s data release by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which covers the first nine months of 2025, total electricity demand has risen by 2.3 percent. That slowdown means that most of the increased demand could have been met by the astonishing growth of solar power. Better than feared If you look over data on the first quarter of 2025, the numbers are pretty grim, with total demand rising by 4.8 percent compared to the same period in the year prior. While solar power continued its remarkable surge, growing by an astonishing 44 percent, it was only able to cover a third of the demand growth. As a result of that and a drop in natural gas usage, coal use grew by 23 percent.Read full article Comments",

The earliest look at OpenAI’s strategy to overcome the string of lawsuits came in a case where parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine accused OpenAI of relaxing safety guardrails that allowed ChatGPT to become the teen’s “suicide coach.” OpenAI deliberately designed the version their son used, ChatGPT 4o, to encourage and validate his suicidal ideation in its quest to build the world’s most engaging chatbot, parents argued. But in a blog, OpenAI claimed that parents selectively chose disturbing chat logs while supposedly ignoring “the full picture” revealed by the teen’s chat history. Digging through the logs, OpenAI claimed the teen told ChatGPT that he’d begun experiencing suicidal ideation at age 11, long before he used the chatbot.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham as its new principal deputy director—a choice that was immediately called “dangerous” and “irresponsible,” yet not as bad as it could have been, by experts. Physician Jeremy Faust revealed the appointment in his newsletter Inside Medicine yesterday, which was subsequently confirmed by journalists. Faust noted that a CDC source told him, “I heard way worse names floated,” and although Abraham’s views are “probably pretty terrible,” he at least has had relevant experience running a public health system, unlike other current leaders of the agency. But Abraham hasn’t exactly been running a health system the way most public health experts would recommend. Under Abraham’s leadership, the Louisiana health department waited months to inform residents about a deadly whooping cough (pertussis) outbreak. He also has a clear record of anti-vaccine views. Earlier this year, he told a Louisiana news outlet he doesn’t recommend COVID-19 vaccines because “I prefer natural immunity.” In February, he ordered the health department to stop promoting mass vaccinations, including flu shots, and barred staff from running seasonal vaccine campaigns.Read full article Comments",

One of the arrestees, Alabama resident Brian Raymond, was the chief technology officer of an AI company called Corvex. Or was he? Corvex certainly seemed to think that Raymond was its CTO in the days before his indictment. Corvex named Raymond as its CTO in a press release and filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which detailed plans for a merger with Movano Health. But once Raymond was arrested, Corvex told media outlets that it had never completed the process of hiring him as an employee. While someone could technically be a CTO as a contractor and not a regular employee, a company spokesperson subsequently claimed to Ars that Raymond had never been the CTO.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Many dog breeds are noted for their personalities and behavioral traits, from the distinctive vocalizations of huskies to the herding of border collies. People have worked to identify the genes associated with many of these behaviors, taking advantage of the fact that dogs can interbreed. But that creates its own experimental challenges, as it can be difficult to separate some behaviors from physical traits distinctive to the breed—small dog breeds may seem more aggressive simply because they feel threatened more often. To get around that, a team of researchers recently did the largest gene/behavior association study within a single dog breed. Taking advantage of a population of over 1,000 golden retrievers, they found a number of genes associated with behaviors within that breed. A high percentage of these genes turned out to correspond to regions of the human genome that have been associated with behavioral differences as well. But, in many cases, these associations have been with very different behaviors. Gone to the dogs The work, done by a team based largely at Cambridge University, utilized the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study, which involved over 3,000 owners of these dogs filling out annual surveys that included information on their dogs’ behavior. Over 1,000 of those owners also had blood samples obtained from their dogs and shipped in; the researchers used these samples to scan the dogs’ genomes for variants. Those were then compared to ratings of the dogs’ behavior on a range of issues, like fear or aggression directed toward strangers or other dogs.Read full article Comments",
