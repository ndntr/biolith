          "standfirst": "It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO Bob Iger’s promise to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the Sora app and ChatGPT. With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. The agreement does not include voices or “talent likenesses,” meaning Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson in it. Instead, both Sora and ChatGPT will only have access to animated and illustrated versions of Marvel and Star Wars characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Han Solo, Darth Vader and others. Disney will stream “curated selections” of Sora-generated fan videos on Disney+. Sora and ChatGPT users will be able to start generating images and videos with Disney characters starting in early 2026. “Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”Disney has also agreed to become an OpenAI customer, promising to use the company’s APIs to build new products, tools and experiences. Additionally, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI, with the option to purchase additional equity down the road. OpenAI recently completed a restructuring to become more of traditional profit-seeking corporation, clearing the way for a potential IPO sometime in the next year or so. Still, the pact brings together two unlikely bedfellows who have been on opposite sides of the copyright debate. Reaction from the entertainment industry was mixed. In a statement released on Bluesky, The Writers Guild of America, which represents writers across film, television and other media, made it clear it is unhappy with the deal:“Disney’s deal with OpenAI appears to sanction its theft of our work and cedes the value of what we create to a tech company that has built its business off our backs. We will meet with Disney to probe the terms of this deal, including the extent to which user-generated videoes will use the work of WGA members. We will continue to fight to protect our members’ creative and economic interests in the context of AI technology.”SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors union which has around 160,000 members worldwide, was less incendiary. It posted a notice on its site saying that both Disney and OpenAI had reached out to the union to give “their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers.” The union noted it would “closely monitor the deal and its implementation to ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice, and likeness.”Update, December 11, 5:45PM ET: This story was updated after publish to include comment from the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html?src=rss",

The latest update to its text translation feature is rolling out first in the US and India, translating between English and just under 20 other languages, including German, Spanish, Chinese and Arabic. It works in the Translate app for iOS and Android and on the web. Gemini’s speech-to-speech translation feature has also been updated, so you can now hear real-time translations in your headphones, like with Apple’s AirPods Pro 3. Google says the new functionality, which is now in beta in the Translate app for Android (iOS is coming next year) in the US, tries to \"preserve the tone, emphasis and cadence of each speaker\" so you better understand the direction of the conversation and who said what. It works with any headphones and supports more than 70 languages. Finally, Google is adding more tools to its potentially Duolingo-rivaling AI-powered language learning tools, which it introduced to the Translate app in August. Like Duolingo, Translate can now track how many days in a row you’ve been attempting to learn a new language, so you can check your progress over time. Whether it will nag you as persistently as the Duolingo owl famously does for slacking off is not clear. The feedback feature has also been improved, so you should receive more useful tips on how you’re pronouncing words or phrases. Germany, India and Sweden are among the 20 new countries that can now use these educational tools. After not showing it much love for a while, Google has been busy adding new features to Translate recently.

          "standfirst": "We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but they usually don’t come cheap. To help those looking to grab one get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week. This week’s highlights include both versions of the latest iPad Air for $150 off at Amazon, matching the all-time lows we last saw around Black Friday. The iPad mini and iPad Pro are each $100 off as well. Beyond iPads, both the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 are even cheaper than they were last month, and there are still decent drops for the AirPods 4, Apple Watch SE 3 and MacBook Air. Here are the best Apple deals from this week that we can find. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $650 ($149 off MSRP): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as its smaller counterpart, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. We gave it a review score of 89 earlier this year. This is another all-time low, but again, make sure to clip the coupon on Amazon's product page to see the full discount. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration adds an improved A17 Pro chip, 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet that’s easier to use with one hand. This discount is $50 more than the all-time low we saw around Cyber Monday but still $100 less than buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $899 ($100 off): The latest iPad Pro is still more tablet than most people will ever need, but its class-leading OLED display, impressively thin design and super-powerful M5 chip make it a luxury experience for those who can afford it. The device was only released in October, so this deal ties its lowest price to date. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,199 ($100 off): It’s not a massive discount, but this matches the lowest price so far for the larger iPad Pro, which may be worthwhile if you’ve got cash to burn and want to use an iPad as your main computer. We gave it a score of 85 in our review. Also at B&H. Best Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $74 ($55 off): If you don't need active noise cancellation and hate the feeling of headphones that just into your ear canal, the standard AirPods 4 remain a good buy. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass as typical in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs along these lines and still offer the usual array of Apple-friendly features. This discount is only $5 more than the all-time low we saw around Black Friday. Also at Best Buy for $85 if that runs out of stock. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $99 ($80 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support on top of the many other iPhone-friendly features included with any set of Apple headphones. It still has an open-back design, so the ANC isn’t as effective as what you’d get with a pair that fully seals off your ear canal, but it’s useful all the same. We gave it a score of 86 in our review. This deal matches the pair’s all-time lowest price. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): This discount has been around for a few weeks, but it’s the lowest price to date for Apple’s newest entry-level smartwatch. We gave the SE 3 a score of 90 in our review last month: The big upgrade is an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or notifications. It still includes most of the essential health and fitness features beyond that, plus it now runs on the same chipset as the higher-end Apple Watch Series 11. Also at Walmart. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($34 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s most feature-rich stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard USB-C model (which isn’t significantly discounted). Just note that it’s not compatible with the entry-level iPad and other older models. While this discount is only $5 below the device’s usual street price, it’s still the largest discount we’ve seen this year. Also at Walmart. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off): The latest iteration of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end model with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal on the base model with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $10 more than the best deal we've seen but $20 less than the config's typical street price.

          "title": "In 2025, AI and EVs gave the US an insatiable hunger for power",
          "standfirst": "You may be surprised to learn electricity only accounts for 21 percent of the world’s energy consumption. Fossil fuels and the rest all play their part to make the world go around, but their role is likely to diminish no matter what happens. The International Energy Agency believes electricity’s share of global energy consumption is going to double in the next decade alone. You all know the causes: Electrification, EVs, data centers and AI mean the planet needs to dramatically increase its power generation, transmission and storage capacity. It’s a shame, then, that the world is nowhere near ready to satisfy such an outrageous surge in demand. Re-learning to love the atomThe US has certainly spent the year opening doors to dramatically increase domestic energy production. Part of that has to give the signal that the US will embrace nuclear power in ways it hasn’t for generations. This January, an executive order titled Unleashing American Energy included an instruction for the government to eliminate rules and regulations related to power generation. Its primary focus was to destroy environmental regulations limiting the extraction of oil, natural gas and coal, but also to remove roadblocks to the construction of new nuclear plants. Then, in May, a subsequent order declared a desire to ensure the deployment of “advanced nuclear technologies.” As the driving force behind the AI push, big tech has made some high profile moves to buy up extra generation capacity. Meta signed a 20-year deal with Constellation to own the output of the Clinton Power Station, preserving the 1.1GW facility once its state tax credit expires next year. Microsoft has its own 20-year deal with Constellation to own the power generated by reactor 1 at Three Mile Island, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. On November 18, that project was also given the backing of the Department of Energy which authorized a $1 billion loan. But even without the backing of big tech, other mothballed reactors are being restarted, like the Palisades plant in Michigan. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy handed out a $1.52 billion loan to get the facility, capable of generating 800MW, back up and running. Big tech is also betting on the future of nuclear power, signing deals with a number of startups looking to build out a new generation of reactors. Google, for instance, has backed Kairos Power and its plan to build a series of small, modular reactors. Amazon, meanwhile, invested in X-Energy and has published plans for its own buildout in Washington State. It’s not just the US that is learning to fall back in love with nuclear power, as the rest of the world is also building out new capacity. The World Nuclear Association says there are 70 reactors currently under construction across 15 countries. Russia, India, Argentina, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, to name just a few, are all working on new reactors. China on its own is presently building 33 reactors and, as Nuclear Business Platform reported earlier this year, greenlit a further 10 this April. That same report adds that China’s policy of producing multiple reactors at a time has seen costs crater. It says that while the UK’s two new reactors at Hinkley Point will cost in excess of $60 billion, each of these new reactors will cost $2.7 billion. Bridging the nuclear gapcoal handling in a portIndigo Division via Getty ImagesBuilding a nuclear reactor is not a swift process, and construction of a facility can take the better part of a decade. You can add on a few more years if you include the necessary procedural steps that need to be undertaken before a single piece of concrete is poured. Consequently, any major shift in the US’ power generation fleet will be measured in generations, rather than years. It’s a concern that, for all of the attention nuclear power is getting, it’s merely a smokescreen for a renewed push for fossil fuel extraction.After all, one major casualty from the Big, Beautiful Bill was the eradication of subsidies for the US’ solar industry. As we reported back in July, the act has kicked the legs out from domestic solar panel manufacturing, handing renewable energy dominance to China. This goes hand in hand with the US Department of Energy setting up a $625 million funding stream to revive America’s coal industry and recommission old power plants. Or that it is also awarding contracts to grow America’s strategic petroleum reserve. Back in September, Energy Secretary Chris Wright made the implausible claim to BBC News that fossil fuel extraction was nothing to worry about as fusion power would be on the grid in the next decade. Wright, himself the former CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, was taken to task by a number of climate experts for publishing a report riddled with “misleading or fundamentally incorrect” assertions. Similarly, on November 20, the Department of Energy reshuffled its org chart to eliminate several departments responsible for renewable energy and energy efficiency while forming the Office of Fusion.

In October, the International Energy Agency projected renewable energy will grow by 4.6 TW by 2030 — a figure equal to the combined generation capacity of China, the EU and Japan combined. 77 percent of that figure is expected to come from solar power alone, despite the loss of subsidies in the US and less favorable circumstances in China. The domestic US forecast has been revised downward significantly as a consequence of its policy choices. But despite this, the obvious benefits of solar power haven’t gone away even if the price may be higher than it was at the start of the year. It remains the fastest and cheapest way to add new power in many countries, and can be installed on a grid or individual basis. Not to mention its utility in remote areas with poor generation resources, where it can reduce dependency on fossil fuels. This year, clean energy think-tank Ember reported on the growth of solar power in the last decade, and how it went from adding just one percent of global power generation in 2015 to 8.8 percent in the first half of 2025.“AI demand for electricity is the macro driver of US made solar,” said Rob Gardner, VP at the Solar Manufacturers for America Coalition. “AI investments can’t deliver expected returns without quickly deployed power, and US solar is the fastest and cheapest to deploy,” he said. Gardner cited a recent FERC forecast which predicts that 92.6GW of solar will come online between now and July 2028. The dream of fusionConstruction inside the reactor of ITER.ITERThe US is pinning a lot of its hopes on fusion power to wipe away the debt of our fossil fuel past. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy released a roadmap to get fusion out of the lab and into the world. It wants to coordinate the remaining resources of the federal government to close the fusion world’s “critical science, materials and technology gaps.” In the next three years, officials have been tasked with designing facilities for reactors and developing sources of fuel. Within the next decade, it’s hoped the government will be able to offer large-scale fuel cycle plants to help private sector plants start operations.If fusion power can be harnessed, it has many of the same upsides as nuclear fission with a lot fewer downsides. If nuclear fission harnesses the energy released when an atom is broken apart, then fusion harnesses the energy released when two smaller atoms are smashed together to create a larger one. It harnesses the same principle as you’ll find inside our sun: Superheated hydrogen atoms fusing to create helium. And while nuclear fusion requires radioactive material, we can source deuterium and tritium from water and lithium. ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is a giant experimental fusion reactor under construction in France which, when operational, will be the world’s largest. It is backed by a coalition of nations, including the US, EU and China, and has the aim of both generating power and developing the technologies necessary to make Fusion a reality. The organization claims that there is enough of both materials available on the planet to run fusion plants for at least a thousand years, if not longer. There are also a raft of safety benefits, as there’s no creation of the sort of long-lived and dangerous waste associated with nuclear power, no risk of a meltdown, and its raw materials can’t be used to make weapons. But while fusion is entirely possible, and on paper could be the salve to all of the world’s energy ills, it’s not yet a reality. There are a large number of engineering challenges sitting between us and a viable commercial reactor. The shift that has happened this year is that fusion is now being treated as a “strategic national priority,” according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. More than 160 fusion facilities are operational worldwide, each one looking to explore ways of solving the hard problems standing between us and limitless power.But as well as ITER, there are other major nations working to build out their own fusion capacity. The biggest would likely be China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) which has already set a record for energy generation. At the start of this year, it was able to produce a steady state for 1,066 seconds. But what we are seeing now, which may offer some degree of hope, is the surge in interest from the private sector. Companies like Commonwealth Fusion, Type One Energy, Helion and Pacific Fusion are all working on their own fusion facilities. These projects have received billions in funding, but it’s likely all will need time to work out if their approaches are viable. Stuart White is a spokesperson for Tokamak Energy, a British-Japanese startup spun out from the UK’s Atomic Energy Authority which is developing its own fusion technologies. In 2022, the company’s own reactor was able to reach a plasma temperature of 100 million degrees celsius. “It’s an incredible achievement but that isn’t going to power homes around the UK or anywhere,” he said. White believes the fusion world will spend the next decade “scaling up,” projects to find the right pathway to building commercial reactors. He cited national programs, like the UK’s STEP which is targeted to begin working in 2040, while the US’ plan for the mid-2030s he feels is “aggressive.”White also explained that, as equally important as solving the key physics issues, is building out the supply chain to actually make the equipment. He cited the importance of manufacturing in Japan and China to produce the hardware necessary to build fusion reactors. And that this process, while time consuming now, will help accelerate the eventual development of the technology down the line. White added that another positive sign is that regulators aren’t likely to want to scrutinize fusion reactors with the same intensity as they do nuclear reactors. That will both speed up the construction of new facilities and reduce costs when they do eventually enter service. What’s clear, however, is that Fusion is not going to be able to swoop in and decarbonize the world’s energy needs in the sort of time scale it’s likely to be required. (White said it is likely to arrive in time to complement other clean sources of energy over the next half century, rather than so quickly that every other power station gets mothballed instantly.) Consequently, the government of the world must keep prioritizing the rollout of renewables rather than hoping that fusion will simply bail everyone out in the next decade.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/in-2025-ai-and-evs-gave-the-us-an-insatiable-hunger-for-power-133000673.html?src=rss",
          "content": "You may be surprised to learn electricity only accounts for 21 percent of the world’s energy consumption. Fossil fuels and the rest all play their part to make the world go around, but their role is likely to diminish no matter what happens. The International Energy Agency believes electricity’s share of global energy consumption is going to double in the next decade alone. You all know the causes: Electrification, EVs, data centers and AI mean the planet needs to dramatically increase its power generation, transmission and storage capacity. It’s a shame, then, that the world is nowhere near ready to satisfy such an outrageous surge in demand. Re-learning to love the atomThe US has certainly spent the year opening doors to dramatically increase domestic energy production. Part of that has to give the signal that the US will embrace nuclear power in ways it hasn’t for generations. This January, an executive order titled Unleashing American Energy included an instruction for the government to eliminate rules and regulations related to power generation. Its primary focus was to destroy environmental regulations limiting the extraction of oil, natural gas and coal, but also to remove roadblocks to the construction of new nuclear plants. Then, in May, a subsequent order declared a desire to ensure the deployment of “advanced nuclear technologies.” As the driving force behind the AI push, big tech has made some high profile moves to buy up extra generation capacity. Meta signed a 20-year deal with Constellation to own the output of the Clinton Power Station, preserving the 1.1GW facility once its state tax credit expires next year. Microsoft has its own 20-year deal with Constellation to own the power generated by reactor 1 at Three Mile Island, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. On November 18, that project was also given the backing of the Department of Energy which authorized a $1 billion loan. But even without the backing of big tech, other mothballed reactors are being restarted, like the Palisades plant in Michigan. Earlier this year, the Department of Energy handed out a $1.52 billion loan to get the facility, capable of generating 800MW, back up and running. Big tech is also betting on the future of nuclear power, signing deals with a number of startups looking to build out a new generation of reactors. Google, for instance, has backed Kairos Power and its plan to build a series of small, modular reactors. Amazon, meanwhile, invested in X-Energy and has published plans for its own buildout in Washington State. It’s not just the US that is learning to fall back in love with nuclear power, as the rest of the world is also building out new capacity. The World Nuclear Association says there are 70 reactors currently under construction across 15 countries. Russia, India, Argentina, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, to name just a few, are all working on new reactors. China on its own is presently building 33 reactors and, as Nuclear Business Platform reported earlier this year, greenlit a further 10 this April. That same report adds that China’s policy of producing multiple reactors at a time has seen costs crater. It says that while the UK’s two new reactors at Hinkley Point will cost in excess of $60 billion, each of these new reactors will cost $2.7 billion.

          "title": "The best E Ink tablets for 2025",
          "standfirst": "E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Table of contents Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? What to look for in an E Ink tablet Other E Ink tablets we've tested Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Onyx Boox Tab X C The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",
          "content": "E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Table of contents Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? What to look for in an E Ink tablet Other E Ink tablets we've tested Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.

          "standfirst": "The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) recently released what it calls its most powerful family of models yet, Olmo 3. But the company kept iterating on the models, expanding its reinforcement learning (RL) runs, to create Olmo 3.1.The new Olmo 3.1 models focus on efficiency, transparency, and control for enterprises. Ai2 updated two of the three versions of Olmo 2: Olmo 3.1 Think 32B, the flagship model optimized for advanced research, and Olmo 3.1 Instruct 32B, designed for instruction-following, multi-turn dialogue, and tool use. Olmo 3 has a third version, Olmo 3-Base for programming, comprehension, and math. It also works well for continue fine-tuning. Ai2 said that to upgrade Olmo 3 Think 32B to Olmo 3.1, its researchers extended its best RL run with a longer training schedule. “After the original Olmo 3 launch, we resumed our RL training run for Olmo 3 32B Think, training for an additional 21 days on 224 GPUs with extra epochs over our Dolci-Think-RL dataset,” Ai2 said in a blog post. “This yielded Olmo 3.1 32B Think, which brings substantial gains across math, reasoning, and instruction-following benchmarks: improvements of 5+ points on AIME, 4+ points on ZebraLogic, 4+ points on IFEval, and 20+ points on IFBench, alongside stronger performance on coding and complex multi-step tasks.”To get to Olmo 3.1 Instruct, Ai2 said its researchers applied the recipe behind the smaller Instruct size, 7B, to the larger model.Olmo 3.1 Instruct 32B is \"optimized for chat, tool use, & multi-turn dialogue—making it a much more performant sibling of Olmo 3 Instruct 7B and ready for real-world applications,” Ai2 said in a post on X. For now, the new checkpoints are available on the Ai2 Playground or Hugging Face, with API access coming soon. Better performance on benchmarksThe Olmo 3.1 models performed well on benchmark tests, predictably beating the Olmo 3 models. Olmo 3.1 Think outperformed Qwen 3 32B models in the AIME 2025 benchmark and performed close to Gemma 27B. Olmo 3.1 Instruct performed strongly against its open-source peers, even beating models like Gemma 3 on the Math benchmark.“As for Olmo 3.1 32B Instruct, it’s a larger-scale instruction-tuned model built for chat, tool use, and multi-turn dialogue. Olmo 3.1 32B Instruct is our most capable fully open chat model to date and — in our evaluations — the strongest fully open 32B-scale instruct model,” the company said. Ai2 also upgraded its RL-Zero 7B models for math and coding. The company said on X that both models benefited from longer and more stable training runs.Commitment to transparency and open source Ai2 previously told VentureBeat that it designed the Olmo 3 family of models to offer enterprises and research labs more control and understanding of the data and training that went into the model. Organizations could add to the model’s data mix and retrain it to also learn from what’s been added. This has long been a commitment for Ai2, which also offers a tool called OlmoTrace that tracks how LLM outputs match its training data. “Together, Olmo 3.1 Think 32B and Olmo 3.1 Instruct 32B show that openness and performance can advance together. By extending the same model flow, we continue to improve capabilities while retaining end-to-end transparency over data, code, and training decisions,” Ai2 said.",

          "title": "Trump orders creation of litigation task force to challenge state AI laws",
          "standfirst": "On Thursday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a single, nationwide regulatory framework governing artificial intelligence at the expense of the ability of different states to regulate the nascent technology. “To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,” the order states. “But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.” As was expected after a draft of the order leaked earlier this week, the centerpiece of the document is an “AI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge state AI laws inconsistent” with the president’s policy vision. US Attorney General Pam Bondi has 30 days to create the task force, which shall meet regularly with the White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks. As laid out in the president’s AI Action Plan from July, the administration will also limit states with “onerous” AI laws from accessing federal funding. Specifically, the secretary of commerce will target funding available under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed internet access in rural communities. Advocacy groups were quick to criticize the president’s order. “This executive order is designed to chill state-level action to provide oversight and accountability for the developers and deployers of AI systems, while doing nothing to address the real and documented harms these systems create,” Alexandra Givens, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in a statement provided to Engadget. “States that take steps to protect their residents from such harms should not be subject to threats of legal attacks; nor should the administration punish rural Americans by threatening to withhold funding for the broadband services that could connect them to AI in the first place.”It’s worth noting President Trump’s previous attempts to curb the ability of states to regulate AI as they see fit has proven unpopular across the political spectrum. As part of his One Big Beautiful Bill, the president attempted to impose a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. That clause was eventually removed from the legislation in a decisive 99-1 vote by the Senate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-creation-of-litigation-task-force-to-challenge-state-ai-laws-022657022.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Control Resonant steps into a larger world that's inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion",
          "standfirst": "Remedy Entertainment's Control is a bizarre yet totally captivating action game that feels like Die Hard by way of David Lynch. InControl: Resonant, players step into the role of the original game's most enigmatic and unsettling characters for their own jaunt through a 'new-weird' world outside The Oldest House.Just ahead of the reveal at The Game Awards, we got an early look at Control: Resonant, the next game in the Remedy Connected Universe. Along with learning why the developers wanted a new protagonist, they also explain why this Neon Genesis Evangelion-inspired sequel is the most expansive game they have made to date.Seven years after the events of Control, the hostile supernatural force that plagued The Oldest House has invaded Manhattan. As the massive urban landscape morphs into an otherworldly nightmare and the Federal Bureau of Control director, Jesse Faden, goes missing, the remaining FBC sends her brother, the notorious supernatural entity Dylan Faden, into the city to stop the invasion. To find his sister and stop the devastation from spreading beyond New York City, Dylan will have to embrace his powers, and some occasional guidance from The Board, to take on the malevolent forces looking to reshape the world.In the years since Control's release, developer Remedy has expanded the story into a larger, connected universe spanning multiple games, including the Alan Wake series and the co-op spin-off FBC: Firebreak. Control: Resonant picks up on many threads left by recent games including Alan Wake 2, which saw the FBC investigate the supernatural events following the titular character. However, the sequel is going with a bit of a different direction, this time embracing melee-driven combat and a more \"open-ended\" approach to exploration within the Inception-style landscape of Manhattan. Though the developers were clear that it is not an open-world game, they stated during the presentation that it is embracing a more action-RPG approach and that it's also the most expansive game they have ever made.It's an interesting premise for a sequel, especially considering the focus on the original game's most unnerving characters. But according to creative director Mikael Kasurinen, the concept ties into showing parallels between the Faden siblings and how they navigate this new-weird world.\"Each game represents one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world. Because of this, you can play these games in any order; they stand on their own feet like two independent siblings,\" Kasurinen said. \"When Dylan wakes up, he's the only one who can fight back against the Hiss and try to contain the disaster. He has lived his whole life inside The Oldest House, so the door leading outside to Manhattan might as well be a portal to an alien world. To him, this leads to a discovery of a new reality, just like what The Oldest House was to Jesse.\"Much like the original game, Control: Resonant maintains that balance of exploration, discovery, and over-the-top action beats to overcome. The sequel leans a bit further into the latter, with Dylan adopting a more aggressive, brawler combat style with his shapeshifting melee weapon. We got to see Dylan switch between short-bladed weapons and a massive hammer, which opened some cool looking combo attacks. It's very much in the vein of Jesse's Service Weapon, but now designed for getting up close to deal heavy melee damage.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentFrom what we saw in the footage, the core combat feels equal parts Nier: Automata and DmC: Devil May Cry, showing Dylan dodging attacks and slipping through blind spots to unleash ground and aerial combo strikes. It's a notable shift away from the third-person shooting gameplay from the original, but it still captures the same weird, otherworldly feel. According to the creative director, the core inspiration for making a sequel with a new character was to contrast storytelling perspectives and gameplay styles — as he puts it, both characters represent two sides of the same coin.\"When we looked at the siblings [as characters], it was almost like turning to the other side of a coin – Jesse uses a gun, but Dylan chooses a melee weapon. When we created the large environments, compared to the original, it was a challenge to incorporate shooting combat, as we didn't want people to have to keep finding cover to avoid fire. But with melee weapons, the combat instantly became more aggressive and intimate, where you're really going for the enemies. It really changed the dynamic of the Control combat experience. So it felt right, and it's also refreshing for us to create something a bit new for us.\"So far, Control: Resonant looks like a sequel that ups the weirdness of the series and takes it into the twisting, inverted streets of Manhattan. It's a stunning-looking game, and one particular source of inspiration for the creative direction was the seminal 1990s anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Having seen the game's corrupted world and enigmatic protagonist in motion, that totally tracks. I can't wait to see what other oddities are to come in Remedy's new-weird sequel.Control: Resonant will arrive in 2026 for PC/Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Ten years after The Witness, Jonathan Blow's next massive puzzle game is almost ready for primetime",
          "standfirst": "Many of the big announcements at The Game Awards are for completely new projects, some of which are total surprises (if you had an Okami sequel on your bingo card last year, you're either in the know or probably used up all your luck for the next few years). We'll often get updates on games that were previously announced too. The trailer for Order of the Sinking Star is something a little different, as it's a game that Braid designer Jonathan Blow has been working on fairly openly since releasing The Witness in 2016. The trailer revealed some new details, including confirmation of the expected title and a release window (2026 on Steam, with more platforms to be announced). Ahead of The Game Awards, Blow gave Engadget a preview of the game and explained some of its many complexities.Fundamentally, Order of the Sinking Star is a grid-based puzzle game in which you'll move blocks around to complete an objective. You might know of this as a Sokoban game, named after the series Hiroyuki Imabayashi created about pushing boxes around a warehouse.But this is a Jonathan Blow game, so nothing stays too simple for very long. Blow and his team took the core concept of pushing objects around and built on it in myriad ways, with a wide array of environments, mechanics and characters for you to get to grips with. Order of the Sinking Star starts with you playing as a deposed queen from another world who is transported to a strange place. This turns out to be the tutorial. Among other things, you'll find out about the undo button, a handy option you can use to revert your actions if you get stuck. It's probably worth being careful with this button, as Blow says it's possible to undo thousands of moves with it. There's a level reset option too.The first phase of the game has four distinct territories with their own characters, stories and gameplay mechanics. One of these realms has a fantasy theme with a warrior character who can push multiple objects that are in a row. His friend, the thief, can only pull objects. The wizard, meanwhile, can teleport and swap positions with objects or other characters. Sometimes, you'll use multiple characters in a level and swap between them to solve puzzles. There’s a talking boat somewhere, too.You'll take what you learn within individual levels into the overworld so you can make progress there. For one thing, the queen can wear a warrior, wizard or thief outfit to adopt their abilities and solve puzzles in the north section of this phase. Over in the east, there’s a world with mirror-based puzzles. By positioning the mirrors and where you stand, you'll use the mirror's reflection to teleport at a right angle. If your character (or an object) has a reflection in two mirrors, they can be duplicated, which is something you might have to do a few times if a level requires you activate multiple switches at the same time.Once you near the end of two of the phase one worlds, you can enter one of six gold rooms. In these rooms, which are the gateways to the second phase of Order of the Sinking Star, some of your characters meet each other for the first time. For instance, the guy from The Mirror Isles and the wizard might encounter each other in a gold room and then you can use their combined abilities to solve puzzles. Given that later-game levels combine mechanics from the early stages, they are naturally more complex. Shifting to 3D perspectives will ramp things up too.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesYou can tackle the four worlds that make up the first phase in any order. Collectively, they contain \"days worth of gameplay,\" Blow said. And yet he claimed this first phase accounts for about five percent of the entire game. All told, there are about 1,400 puzzles, many of which are optional. If you're a completionist, you'll need to be pretty dedicated to see this through. Blow estimates that it'll take around 500 hours for a player to do absolutely everything in the game. The overworld has more than 100 screens from which you can jump into individual levels. \"All the levels are about ideas. They're not just random puzzles,\" Blow said. \"We don't add puzzles to the game unless they show something cool about how the objects interact. Then, once you see the cool thing, you come back to the overworld, and you navigate from that screen using the cool mechanic that you learned.\"\"We\" is a key word there, because it's not as if Blow has been making Order of the Sinking Star by himself for the last decade. His studio, Thekla, has around 10 people working on the game full-time along with another 10 or so part-time contractors. Those who contributed include puzzle game designers Alan Hazelden and Marc ten Bosch. Some members of Blow's Twitch community who \"contributed some idea to one of the levels somewhere\" will receive design credits too.Blow and his team use custom game engines for their projects. Starting in around 2013, he started livestreaming his work on the programming language that Order of the Sinking Star is written in (Thekla will eventually make the engine available for free as an open-source project). \"Once I was working on the game, it was a good way to show people what the programming language was about and also how game programming works, and so I would frequently do just streams where we would sit down and implement something,\" Blow said. Some of the design work he did on stream ended up in the final game.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesAfter such a long time of working on Order of the Sinking Star, the end is in sight for Blow and his team. The main focus for the last year or so has been on making sure all of the puzzles align with the overworld. Making art for many hundreds of levels is a major undertaking too, while Blow is still refining the story. \"Because there's a lot of these levels and a lot of characters in the levels, it's just natural for them to talk to each other,\" Blow said. \"And so what is that dialog and what does it do? Is it just little jokes that don't add up to anything? Or do you get little peeks into a larger narrative? I think the latter is obviously better. And so that's my main task between now and release, is making sure that the story is really good.\"Blow had the core concept of having separate worlds with mechanics that work across them in place from the very beginning, though how that worked in practice evolved a lot over time. For instance, the overworld idea wasn't set in stone from the outset. There was an overworld in place by around 2021, \"but it wasn't organized in the way the current one was. It was just sort of areas smushed together,\" Blow said. \"At some point, I came up with this concept that it was spatially organized in an almost ritualistic manner or a mathematical manner, whichever way you want to think about it. And we redesigned the overworld from that point, and from then till now, it's been just sort of a continuous improvement.\"Order of the Sinking Star was originally supposed to be a much smaller game that took around 10 or 20 hours to play, but \"it just blew up,\" Blow said. \"Part of development has just been dealing with that fact. Like, oh, my God, this game took so long to make. It actually feels really good to be here toward the end. We still have a fair bit of work to do before it's done, but we can see the ending from where we are now, and that's great.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ten-years-after-the-witness-jonathan-blows-next-massive-puzzle-game-is-almost-ready-for-primetime-015727378.html?src=rss",

Some of the design work he did on stream ended up in the final game.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesAfter such a long time of working on Order of the Sinking Star, the end is in sight for Blow and his team. The main focus for the last year or so has been on making sure all of the puzzles align with the overworld. Making art for many hundreds of levels is a major undertaking too, while Blow is still refining the story. \"Because there's a lot of these levels and a lot of characters in the levels, it's just natural for them to talk to each other,\" Blow said. \"And so what is that dialog and what does it do? Is it just little jokes that don't add up to anything? Or do you get little peeks into a larger narrative? I think the latter is obviously better. And so that's my main task between now and release, is making sure that the story is really good.\"Blow had the core concept of having separate worlds with mechanics that work across them in place from the very beginning, though how that worked in practice evolved a lot over time. For instance, the overworld idea wasn't set in stone from the outset. There was an overworld in place by around 2021, \"but it wasn't organized in the way the current one was. It was just sort of areas smushed together,\" Blow said. \"At some point, I came up with this concept that it was spatially organized in an almost ritualistic manner or a mathematical manner, whichever way you want to think about it. And we redesigned the overworld from that point, and from then till now, it's been just sort of a continuous improvement.\"Order of the Sinking Star was originally supposed to be a much smaller game that took around 10 or 20 hours to play, but \"it just blew up,\" Blow said. \"Part of development has just been dealing with that fact. Like, oh, my God, this game took so long to make. It actually feels really good to be here toward the end. We still have a fair bit of work to do before it's done, but we can see the ending from where we are now, and that's great.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ten-years-after-the-witness-jonathan-blows-next-massive-puzzle-game-is-almost-ready-for-primetime-015727378.html?src=rss",

It stars a hero rarely seen in video games, an elderly woman, and it has gorgeous storybook-style art in a lush fantasy setting. It’s a single-player puzzle platformer, it relies on wordless storytelling and the woman, a witch named Gertie, travels with a creepy-cute companion. Plus, Gertie has chicken feet. I love her little chicken feet.Coven of the Chicken Foot is the first game from Wildflower Interactive, the independent studio founded by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley. The game is coming to Steam and it’s available to wishlist now, though there’s no firm release date. The first trailer for Coven of the Chicken Foot premiered at The Game Awards 2025, showing Gertie and her friend traveling together through caves, forests and temples. Gertie is on a quest to prove herself to the local coven by standing up to the self-appointed, prideful heroes of the land. She doesn’t have a sword or a dodgeroll, and instead has to figure out how to work with her strange friend to survive. Her companion develops unique behaviors based on individual play styles, shaping how Gertie gets around.Straley left Naughty Dog in 2017 after almost 20 years with the studio, where he directed The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. He announced Wildflower Interactive in July 2022 with a brief YouTube message, saying, “In 2017 I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore. But the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still. And this idea kept following me. So I grabbed some friends and we started prototyping.”This naturally led to the formation of a studio, Straley explained. “We have to do it the right way,” he said in the video. “It has to be inclusive, equitable and collaborative, full of big-hearted people that want to grow both professionally and personally. The culture needs to be as iterative as the way we make games.”Coven of the Chicken FootWildflower InteractiveToday Wildflower Interactive has 16 employees from AAA and smaller-scale backgrounds, according to its website. Its mission statement reads as follows:“We’re making ‘small-ish,’ creatively-charged, uniquely-stylized games that explore the possibilities of our medium. And we’re building a small, open-hearted team of creators that want to improve their skills and still lead a good life outside of work. People that want to hone their craft, have a say in the process, feel respected for their contributions, and be a part of the evolution of this awesome medium.”I’m not going to say the studio’s direct and repeated emphasis on work-life balance, diversity and compassion is a response to the soulless capitalistic grind built into the AAA development complex, but I’m not going to not say that, either.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/coven-of-the-chicken-foot-is-the-debut-game-from-naughty-dog-alum-bruce-straleys-indie-studio-014004553.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Google’s new framework helps AI agents spend their compute and tool budget more wisely",
          "standfirst": "In a new paper that studies tool-use in large language model (LLM) agents, researchers at Google and UC Santa Barbara have developed a framework that enables agents to make more efficient use of tool and compute budgets. The researchers introduce two new techniques: a simple \"Budget Tracker\" and a more comprehensive framework called \"Budget Aware Test-time Scaling.\" These techniques make agents explicitly aware of their remaining reasoning and tool-use allowance.As AI agents rely on tool calls to work in the real world, test-time scaling has become less about smarter models and more about controlling cost and latency.For enterprise leaders and developers, budget-aware scaling techniques offer a practical path to deploying effective AI agents without facing unpredictable costs or diminishing returns on compute spend.The challenge of scaling tool useTraditional test-time scaling focuses on letting models \"think\" longer. However, for agentic tasks like web browsing, the number of tool calls directly determines the depth and breadth of exploration.This introduces significant operational overhead for businesses. \"Tool calls such as webpage browsing results in more token consumption, increases the context length and introduces additional time latency,\" Zifeng Wang and Tengxiao Liu, co-authors of the paper, told VentureBeat. \"Tool calls themselves introduce additional API costs.\"The researchers found that simply granting agents more test-time resources does not guarantee better performance. \"In a deep research task, if the agent has no sense of budget, it often goes down blindly,\" Wang and Liu explained. \"It finds one somewhat related lead, then spends 10 or 20 tool calls digging into it, only to realize that the entire path was a dead end.\"Optimizing resources with Budget TrackerTo evaluate how they can optimize tool-use budgets, the researchers first tried a lightweight approach called \"Budget Tracker.\" This module acts as a plug-in that provides the agent with a continuous signal of resource availability, enabling budget-aware tool use.The team hypothesized that \"providing explicit budget signals enables the model to internalize resource constraints and adapt its strategy without requiring additional training.\"Budget Tracker operates purely at the prompt level, which makes it easy to implement. (The paper provides full details on the prompts used for Budget Tracker, which makes it easy to implement.)In Google&#x27;s implementation, the tracker provides a brief policy guideline describing the budget regimes and corresponding recommendations for using tools. At each step of the response process, Budget Tracker makes the agent explicitly aware of its resource consumption and remaining budget, enabling it to condition subsequent reasoning steps on the updated resource state.To test this, the researchers experimented with two paradigms: sequential scaling, where the model iteratively refines its output, and parallel scaling, where multiple independent runs are conducted and aggregated. They ran experiments on search agents equipped with search and browse tools following a ReAct-style loop. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is a popular method where the model alternates between internal thinking and external actions. To trace a true cost-performance scaling trend, they developed a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for the costs of both internal token consumption and external tool interactions.They tested Budget Tracker on three information-seeking QA datasets requiring external search, including BrowseComp and HLE-Search, using models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Claude Sonnet 4. The experiments show that this simple plug-in improves performance across various budget constraints.\"Adding Budget Tracker achieves comparable accuracy using 40.4% fewer search calls, 19.9% fewer browse calls, and reducing overall cost … by 31.3%,\" the authors told VentureBeat. Finally, Budget Tracker continued to scale as the budget increased, whereas plain ReAct plateaued after a certain threshold.BATS: A comprehensive framework for budget-aware scalingTo further improve tool-use resource optimization, the researchers introduced Budget Aware Test-time Scaling (BATS), a framework designed to maximize agent performance under any given budget. BATS maintains a continuous signal of remaining resources and uses this information to dynamically adapt the agent&#x27;s behavior as it formulates its response.BATS uses multiple modules to orchestrate the agent&#x27;s actions. A planning module adjusts stepwise effort to match the current budget, while a verification module decides whether to \"dig deeper\" into a promising lead or \"pivot\" to alternative paths based on resource availability.Given an information-seeking question and a tool-call budget, BATS begins by using the planning module to formulate a structured action plan and decide which tools to invoke. When tools are invoked, their responses are appended to the reasoning sequence to provide the context with new evidence. When the agent proposes a candidate answer, the verification module verifies it and decides whether to continue the current sequence or initiate a new attempt with the remaining budget.The iterative process ends when budgeted resources are exhausted, at which point an LLM-as-a-judge selects the best answer across all verified answers. Throughout the execution, the Budget Tracker continuously updates both resource usage and remaining budget at every iteration.The researchers tested BATS on the BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, and HLE-Search benchmarks against baselines including standard ReAct and various training-based agents. Their experiments show that BATS achieves higher performance while using fewer tool calls and incurring lower overall cost than competing methods. Using Gemini 2.5 Pro as the backbone, BATS achieved 24.6% accuracy on BrowseComp compared to 12.6% for standard ReAct, and 27.0% on HLE-Search compared to 20.5% for ReAct.BATS not only improves effectiveness under budget constraints but also yields better cost–performance trade-offs. For example, on the BrowseComp dataset, BATS achieved higher accuracy at a cost of approximately 23 cents compared to a parallel scaling baseline that required over 50 cents to achieve a similar result.According to the authors, this efficiency makes previously expensive workflows viable. \"This unlocks a range of long-horizon, data-intensive enterprise applications… such as complex codebase maintenance, due-diligence investigations, competitive landscape research, compliance audits, and multi-step document analysis,\" they said.As enterprises look to deploy agents that manage their own resources, the ability to balance accuracy with cost will become a critical design requirement.\"We believe the relationship between reasoning and economics will become inseparable,\" Wang and Liu said. \"In the future, [models] must reason about value.\"",

Besides being somewhat dry, the AI-generated recap incorrectly identifies the time period of the show's Los Angeles-set flashbacks as being the 1950s, when they're actually 2077 (the Fallout franchise is set in an alternate history that diverged from our real one after 1945). As Gizmodo notes, the recap also seems to misunderstand the ending of the first season, which sets up season two's partnership between vault dweller Lucy and The Ghoul, an irradiated wastelander with a personal connection to the mystery at the heart of the first season.While the recap suggests Amazon's AI system can successfully combine clips, music and dialogue into a coherent video, it apparently lacks an understanding of the details. The inaccuracies in this recap won't prevent anyone from enjoying the second season of the show, but they don't exactly inspire confidence in Amazon's tool either. It also seems like a problem that could have been easily solved by having a human employee who's watched the show review the video before it was uploaded.Unfortunately, Amazon's lack of AI quality control extends beyond recaps of its shows and into the dubs for the shows themselves.

          "standfirst": "This morning Disney and OpenAI announced a three-year licensing agreement: Starting in 2026, ChatGPT and Sora can generate images and videos incorporating Disney IP, including more than 200 characters from the company's stable of Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel brands. To say these companies make for strange bedfellows is an understatement. The agreement brings together two parties with very different public stances on copyright. Before OpenAI released Sora, the company reportedly notified studios and talent agencies they would need to opt out of having their work appear in the new app. The company later backtracked on this stance. Before that, OpenAI admitted, in a regulatory filing, it would be \"impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.\" By contrast, Disney takes copyright law very seriously. In fact, you could argue no other company has done more to shape US copyright law than Disney. For example, there's the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which is more derisively known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. The law effectively froze the advancement of the public domain in the United States, with Disney being the greatest beneficiary. It was only last year that the company's copyright for Steamboat Willie expired, 95 years after Walt Disney first created the iconic cartoon.On the face of it, it's unclear OpenAI is getting much value out of the deal. As part of the pact, Disney will host a \"curated\" selection of Sora-generated videos on its streaming platform Disney+, legitimizing the medium of AI-generated video in a way it hasn't been before, but it would appear Disney has the option to spotlight as much or little of it as it sees fit.Additionally, the $1 billion Disney agreed to invest in OpenAI is a drop in the ocean for a company that's expected to burn through more cash in five years than Uber, Tesla, Amazon and Spotify did combined before they became profitable. If anything, the addition of Disney characters is likely to make operating ChatGPT and Sora more expensive for OpenAI; the company will now need to pay a licensing fee on top of the cost of running its servers to generate images and videos. At this stage, it's also hard to put a value on Disney's pledge to use OpenAI's APIs. The company has said those tools will \"enable new products, tools and experiences,\" including some found inside of Disney+, but beyond that it hasn't shared specifics.Bob Iger might be feckless, but he's not stupid. Sometime this week or soon after, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that makes good on part of his AI Action Plan from July. Specifically, the president has promised to fight against \"burdensome\" state-level regulation of AI. According to CNN, a recent draft of Trump's order calls for the creation of an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge and preempt state AI laws in favor of the president's own more lax regulatory regime. It's unclear how successful the administration will be in that effort, but clearly Disney is thinking ahead. It's banking on the fact that this time it won't be able to count on the federal government to shape copyright law in its interest, so instead it's making a deal with an industry pushing the boundaries of intellectual property rights as we know them. More importantly, it has partnered with the one AI company it can actually leverage. As I argued in a recent piece, OpenAI is in a far different and more precarious position now than it was at the end of 2022 following the release of ChatGPT. The company is just one AI provider in a sea of competition, and you can't even argue its models are the best, based either on benchmarks or user feedback. Moreover, OpenAI has yet to turn a profit, and has adopted an extremely risky investment strategy. In recent months it has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, hoping to outmuscle the competition that's already beating it through scale. It's not an accident Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google a day before its agreement with OpenAI became public. OpenAI might be the most valuable private company in the world, but Alphabet, Google's parent company, is worth more than $3 trillion. In any negotiations between the two, at best Disney would be on equal footing, and certainly not in a position where it could demand some amount of control over Google's AI projects. And yet by accounts it won exactly that from OpenAI. According to Axios, the deal gives Disney a fair amount of control over how its intellectual property is used. The two will form a joint steering committee designed to monitor the content users create on ChatGPT and Sora. As you surf the web today, you'll likely see a lot of opinions on how this legitimizes AI video. And while that's true, far more important is the fact Disney has secured a seat at the table to decide how the technology evolves over the coming years. Much like with news publishers, OpenAI and other chatbots concerns took a stance of begging forgiveness rather than asking permission towards copyright. It seems to have paid off. Most of the highest-profile news organizations have signed licensing deals to at least be paid a little rather than be ripped off until reaching an uncertain verdict in court. Disney seems to be signalling that the same speculation rush is about to begin for audiovisual licensing, and it may have already secured the most favorable terms.

Per Hochul's announcement, the law \"requires persons who produce or create an advertisement to identify if it includes AI generated synthetic performers.\" S.8391, meanwhile, \"requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.\"“By signing these bills today, we are enacting common sense laws that will ensure we are fully transparent when using images generated by artificial intelligence and also prevent the unauthorized commercial use of a deceased individual’s name or likeness,\" Governor Hochul said in the announcement. \"In New York State, we are setting a clear standard that keeps pace with technology, while protecting artists and consumers long after the credits roll.\"The use of AI performers and deepfakes made using the likenesses of actors were major focuses of the contract SAG-AFTRA won during its strike in 2023. The union ultimately agreed to allow for the use of things like digital replicas and AI-generated performers, with some key carveouts. For example, actors have to give their explicit consent for a digital replica to be made in their image. They also have to give their consent each time the replica is used and are supposed to receive a pre-negotiated rate every time the replica appears in a production.New York's new regulations put further safeguards around both practices, and join a growing collection of state AI laws that have passed or are currently being considered this year. Because of the close relationship between tech companies and the Trump administration, though, multiple attempts have been made to prevent such laws from existing at all. A decade-long ban on state AI regulation was included in early drafts of the Big Beautiful Bill, and David Sacks, venture capitalist and White House Special Advisor, has reportedly gone to great lengths to try and get President Donald Trump to sign an executive order banning state AI regulation.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI's \"code red\" response to Google's Gemini 3 Pro has arrived. On the same day the company announced a Sora licensing pact with Disney, it took the wraps off GPT-5.2. OpenAI is touting the new model as its best yet for real-world, professional use. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects,” said OpenAI.In a series of 10 benchmarks highlighted by OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Thinking, the most advanced version of the model, outperformed its GPT-5.1 counterpart, sometimes by a significant margin. For example, in AIME 2025, a test that involves 30 challenging mathematics problems, the model earned a perfect 100 percent score, beating out GPT-5.1’s already state-of-the-art score of 94 perfect. It also achieved that feat without turning to tools like web search. Meanwhile, in ARC-AGI-1, a benchmark that tests an AI system’s ability to reason abstractly like a human being would, the new system beat GPT-5.1’s score by more than 10 percentage points. OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Thinking is better at answering questions factually, with the company finding it produces errors 30 percent less frequently. “For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support — making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work,” the company said. The new model should be better in conversation too. Of the version of the system most users are likely to encounter, OpenAI says “GPT‑5.2 Instant is a fast, capable workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-tos and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation, building on the warmer conversational tone introduced in GPT‑5.1 Instant.“While it's probably overstating things to suggest this is a make or break release for OpenAI, it is fair to say the company does have a lot riding on GPT 5.2. Its big release of 2025, GPT-5, didn't meet expectations. Users complained of a system that generated surprisingly dumb answers and had a boring personality. The disappointment with GPT-5 was such that people began demanding OpenAI bring back GPT-4o. Then came Gemini 3 Pro — which jumped to the top of LMArena, a website where humans rate outputs from AI systems to vote on the best one. Following Google's announcement, Sam Altman reportedly called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Before today, the company's previous model, GPT-5.1, was ranked sixth on LMArena, with systems from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI occupying the spots between OpenAI between Google. For a company that recently signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition, that was not a good position for OpenAI to be in. In his memo to staff, Altman said GPT-5.2 would be the equal of Gemini 3 Pro. With the new system rolling out now, we'll see whether that's true, and what it might mean for the company if it can't at least match Google's best. OpenAI is offering three different versions of GPT-5.2: Instant, Thinking and Pro. All three models will be first available to users on the company’s paid plans. Notably, the company plans to keep GPT-5.1 around, at least for a little while. Paid users can continue to use the older model for the next three months by selecting it from the legacy models section.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit after a man killed his mother and took his own life back in August, according to a report by The Verge. The suit names CEO Sam Altman and accuses ChatGPT of putting a \"target\" on the back of victim Suzanne Adams, an 83-year-old woman who was killed in her home. The victim's estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot \"validated and magnified\" certain \"paranoid beliefs.\" The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot \"eagerly accepted\" delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way. The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a \"universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.\" ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was \"100% being monitored and targeted\" and was \"100% right to be alarmed.\" The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim's printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for \"passive motion detection\" and \"behavior mapping.\" It went so far as to say that she was \"knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point\" and implied she was being controlled by an external force.

          "content": "OpenAI has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit after a man killed his mother and took his own life back in August, according to a report by The Verge. The suit names CEO Sam Altman and accuses ChatGPT of putting a \"target\" on the back of victim Suzanne Adams, an 83-year-old woman who was killed in her home. The victim's estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot \"validated and magnified\" certain \"paranoid beliefs.\" The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot \"eagerly accepted\" delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way. The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a \"universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.\" ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was \"100% being monitored and targeted\" and was \"100% right to be alarmed.\" The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim's printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for \"passive motion detection\" and \"behavior mapping.\" It went so far as to say that she was \"knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point\" and implied she was being controlled by an external force. The chatbot also allegedly \"identified other real people as enemies.\" These included an Uber Eats driver, an AT&T employee, police officers and a woman the perpetrator went on a date with.

During the briefing, OpenAI executives acknowledged the directive but pushed back on the narrative that the model was rushed solely to answer Google.\"It is important to note this has been in the works for many, many months,\" Simo told reporters.

Schwarzer noted that on SWE-bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering, GPT-5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score of 55.6%. He emphasized that this benchmark is \"more contamination resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant than previous benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified.\"Other key benchmark results include:GPQA Diamond (Science): GPT-5.2 Pro scored 93.2%, edging out GPT-5.2 Thinking (92.4%) and surpassing GPT-5.1 Thinking (88.1%).FrontierMath: On Tier 1-3 problems, GPT-5.2 Thinking solved 40.3%, a significant jump from the 31.0% achieved by its predecessor.ARC-AGI-1: GPT-5.2 Pro is reportedly the first model to cross the 90% threshold on this general reasoning benchmark, scoring 90.5%The Price of IntelligencePerformance comes at a premium. While ChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged for now, the API costs for the new flagship models are steep compared to previous generations, reflecting the high compute demands of \"thinking\" mode. They&#x27;re also on the upper-end of API costs for the industry. GPT-5.2 Thinking: Priced at $1.75 per 1 million input tokens and $14 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Pro: The costs jump significantly to $21 per 1 million input tokens and $168 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Thinking is priced 40% higher in the API than the standard GPT-5.1 ($1.25/$10), signaling that OpenAI views the new reasoning capabilities as a tangible value-add rather than a mere efficiency update.The high-end GPT-5.2 Pro follows the same pattern, costing 40% more than the previous GPT-5 Pro ($15/$120). While expensive, it still undercuts OpenAI’s most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which remains the most costly offering on the menu at a staggering $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.OpenAI argues that despite the higher per-token cost, the model’s \"greater token efficiency\" and ability to solve tasks in fewer turns make it economically viable for high-value enterprise workflows.Here&#x27;s how it compares to the current API costs for other competing models across the LLM field:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen-Max$1.60$6.40$8.00Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIImage Generation: Nothing New Yet...But &#x27;More to Come&#x27;During the briefing, VentureBeat asked the OpenAI participants if the new release included any boost to image generation capabilities, noting the excitement around similar features in recent competitor launches like Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Image aka Nano Banana Pro. Unfortunately for those seeking to recreate the kind of text-and-information heavy graphics and image editing capabilities, OpenAI executives clarified that GPT-5.2 comes with no current image improvements over the prior GPT-5.1 and OpenAI&#x27;s integrated DALL-E 3 and gpt-4o native image generation models.\"On image Gen, nothing to announce today, but more to come,\" Simo said.

When asked why legacy models like GPT-5.1 would remain available, Schwarzer admitted that \"models change a little bit every time.\"Some users may find that they prefer the vibes of the previous model, even though we think the latest one is across the board generally much better,\" Schwarzer said. He also noted that for some enterprise customers who have \"really fine-tuned a prompt for a specific model,\" there might be \"small regressions,\" necessitating access to the older versions.Safety, &#x27;Adult Mode,&#x27; and Future RoadmapAddressing safety concerns, Simo confirmed that the company is preparing to roll out an \"Adult Mode\" in the first quarter of next year, following the implementation of a new age prediction system.\"We&#x27;re in the process of improving that,\" Simo said regarding the age prediction technology. \"We want to do that ahead of launching adult mode.\"Looking further ahead, industry reports suggest OpenAI is working on a more fundamental architectural shift under the codename \"Project Garlic,\" targeting a flagship release in early 2026. While executives did not comment on specific future roadmaps during the briefing, Simo remained optimistic about the economics of their current trajectory.\"If you look at historical trends, compute has increased about 3x every year for the last three years,\" she explained. \"Revenue has also increased at the same pace... creating this virtuous cycle.\"Clark added that efficiency is improving rapidly: \"The model we&#x27;re releasing today achieves an even better score [on ARC-AGI] with almost 400 times less cost and less compute associated with it\" compared to models from a year ago.GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro begin rolling out in ChatGPT today to paid users (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise).

Variety reports that Disney attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday. “Google is infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale, by copying a large corpus of Disney’s copyrighted works without authorization to train and develop generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) models and services, and by using AI models and services to commercially exploit and distribute copies of its protected works to consumers in violation of Disney’s copyrights,” reads the letter, which Variety reviewed. The letter includes examples of images from several Disney properties including Deadpool, Moana, Star Wars and others, reproduced by Google's AI tools. Disney is demanding that Google implement guardrails within all its AI products to prevent further infringement. The media giant sent a similar letter to Character.AI in September, and is currently suing Hailuo and Midjourney over alleged copyright infringement. Copyright enforcement has become more challenging in the face of AI-created imagery, and companies are increasingly taking an \"if you can't beat them, join them\" approach. Today Disney announced a deal with OpenAI to license its characters for use in Sora, OpenAI's video generator. The deal will see Disney invest $1 billion in OpenAI (a paltry sum by some standards), with the option to purchase additional equity at a later date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html?src=rss",

          "title": "CES 2026 preview: What to expect from tech's biggest conference in January",
          "standfirst": "CES doesn't start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech's biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its \"Innovation in Tune with You\" presentation to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence\" at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Marble, a startup building artificial intelligence agents for tax professionals, has raised $9 million in seed funding as the accounting industry grapples with a deepening labor shortage and mounting regulatory complexity.The round, led by Susa Ventures with participation from MXV Capital and Konrad Capital, positions Marble to compete in a market where AI adoption has lagged significantly behind other knowledge industries like law and software development.\"When we looked at the economy and asked ourselves where AI is going to transform the way businesses operate, we focused on knowledge industries — specifically businesses with hourly fee-based service models,\" said Bhavin Shah, Marble&#x27;s chief executive officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Accounting generates $250 billion in fee-based billing in the US every year. There&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity to increase efficiency and improve margins for accounting firms.\"The company has launched a free AI-powered tax research tool on its website that converts complex government tax data into accessible, citation-backed answers for practitioners. Marble plans to expand into AI agents that can analyze compliance scenarios and eventually automate portions of tax preparation workflows.Marble&#x27;s backers share Shah&#x27;s conviction about the market. \"Marble is rethinking the accounting system from the ground up. Accounting is one of the biggest — and most overlooked — markets in professional services,\" Chad Byers, general partner at Susa Ventures, told VentureBeat. \"We&#x27;ve known Bhavin from his time as an executive in the Susa portfolio, and have seen firsthand how sharp and execution-driven he is. He and Geordie bring the perfect mix of operational depth and product instinct to a space long overdue for change — and they see the same massive opportunity we do.\"The accounting industry lost 340,000 workers in four years — and replacements aren&#x27;t comingMarble enters a market shaped by structural forces that have fundamentally altered the economics of professional accounting.The accounting profession has shed roughly 340,000 workers since 2019, a 17% decline that has left firms scrambling to meet client demands. First-time candidates for the Certified Public Accountant exam dropped 33% between 2016 and 2021, according to AICPA data, and 2022 saw the lowest number of exam takers in 17 years.The exodus comes as baby boomers exit en masse. The American Institute of CPAs estimates that approximately 75% of all licensed CPAs reached retirement age by 2019, creating a demographic cliff that the profession has struggled to address.“Fewer CPAs are getting certified year over year,\" Shah said. \"The industry is compressing at the same time that there&#x27;s more work to be done and the tax code is getting more complicated.\"The National Pipeline Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body formed by the AICPA in July 2023, released a report identifying the 150-hour education requirement for CPA licensure as a significant barrier to entry. A separate survey by the Center for Audit Quality found that 57% of business majors who chose not to pursue accounting cited the additional credit hours as a deterrent.Recent legislative changes reflect the urgency. Ohio now offers alternatives to the 150-hour requirement, signaling that states are willing to experiment with pathways that could reverse enrollment declines.Why AI transformed law and software development but left accounting behindDespite the profession&#x27;s challenges, AI adoption in accounting has moved more slowly than in adjacent knowledge industries. Harvey and Legora have raised hundreds of millions to bring AI to legal work. Cursor and other coding assistants have transformed software development. Accounting, by contrast, remains largely dependent on legacy research platforms and manual processes.Geordie Konrad, Marble&#x27;s executive chairman and a co-founder of restaurant software company TouchBistro, attributes the gap to how people conceptualize AI&#x27;s capabilities.“It was obvious to many people that LLMs could do meaningful work by manipulating code for software developers and manipulating words for lawyers. In the accounting industry, LLMs are going to be used as reasoning agents,\" Konrad said. \" That requires a bit more of a two-step analysis to see why it&#x27;s a big opportunity.\"The technical challenge is substantial. Tax regulations form one of the most complex, interconnected information systems that humans have created — tens of thousands of interlocking rules, guidance documents, and jurisdiction-specific requirements that frequently overlap or conflict.\"If you want to put AI through its paces and ask how far it&#x27;s come in replicating cognitive functions, this is an unbelievable playground to work in,\" Konrad said.A dramatic shift: AI adoption among tax and finance teams doubles in one yearRecent data suggests the accounting profession&#x27;s stance toward AI is shifting rapidly.A 2025 survey from Hanover Research and Avalara found that 84% of finance and tax teams now use AI heavily in their operations, up from 47% in 2024. The 2025 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from Thomson Reuters Institute found that 21% of tax firms already use generative AI technology, with 53% either planning to adopt it or actively considering it.Large accounting firms have invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Deloitte has developed generative AI capabilities within its audit platform. BDO announced a $1B investment in AI over the next five years. EY launched an AI platform combining technology with strategy, transactions, and tax services. PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven. According to Thomson Reuters research, 52% of tax firm respondents who use generative AI rely on open-source tools like ChatGPT rather than industry-specific solutions—a pattern that could shift as purpose-built alternatives emerge.Marble&#x27;s founders believe the hesitance stems not from technophobia but from a lack of compelling options.“Firms want to embrace AI,\" Shah said. “They just haven&#x27;t seen great software and tooling made for them. That&#x27;s part of the opportunity — to work with them and build something they&#x27;re excited to use on a day-to-day basis.”Can artificial intelligence rescue accounting&#x27;s billable-hour business model?AI&#x27;s arrival in accounting raises questions about the profession&#x27;s billing structure.Accounting firms have traditionally generated profits by billing clients for staff time, often at multiples of employee compensation costs. Junior associates performing compliance work represent a significant revenue stream. If AI can automate that work, does it undercut the business model firms depend on?Marble&#x27;s founders argue the opposite. The chronic staffing shortage has already constrained firms&#x27; ability to capture available revenue. Advisory and consulting work — higher-margin services that clients actively want — goes undone because practitioners are buried in compliance tasks.\"Everyone in the industry agrees that an enormous amount of advisory work simply isn&#x27;t getting done,\" Konrad said. \"Customers want it. Firms want to do it because it&#x27;s high-margin, great work. But nobody gets to it.\"The 2025 AICPA National Management of an Accounting Practice Survey supports this view. Firms reported a median 6.7% increase in net client fees over the prior year, with growth in audit, assurance, tax services, and client accounting advisory. Net remaining per partner climbed 11.9% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, reaching $252,663.The survey also found growing interest in AI adoption, though most firms have yet to allocate formal budgets or develop structured training programs. Continued adoption, the survey suggested, could help expand services and fuel continued growth.Accountants won&#x27;t adopt AI tools they can&#x27;t trust with sensitive client dataFor AI to succeed in accounting, it must clear a high bar for data security. Accounting firms handle some of the most sensitive financial information in the economy. Practitioners cannot adopt tools that create compliance or confidentiality risks.According to Avalara&#x27;s survey, 63% of respondents cited data security and privacy concerns as the top barriers to automating tax and finance functions. The concern persists throughout the adoption lifecycle, from initial selection through implementation and ongoing use.Marble has made security a foundational priority. The company obtained software compliance certification before releasing any product and maintains that data privacy is embedded in its operational culture from day one.\"Security is at the core of what we are building,\" Shah said. \"Every employee knows that security is critical. It&#x27;s a part of our onboarding and something that we consider in everything we do.\"From number crunchers to strategic advisors: How AI could reshape accounting careersMarble&#x27;s founders reject the narrative that AI will only take away from accounting jobs. They propose instead that AI will result in accounting jobs becoming more strategic and less characterized by repetitive execution. They draw an analogy to architecture, where computer-aided design replaced laborious manual drafting. Architects did not disappear — they gained tools that let them spend more time on creative design and less on mechanical reproduction.\"If you take some of the hours-intensive, less creative work out of what being a junior or intermediate accountant is, and you replace it with a role where you&#x27;re a professional who is being creative, synthesizing ideas, and able to delegate a lot of tasks to AI assistant platform solutions, you end up with an industry that&#x27;s just a lot more fun to operate in,\" Konrad said.The shift could also improve client outcomes. When accountants spend less time on compliance, they can invest more in the strategic advisory work that clients value.\"Not only does the work become more enjoyable because of what you can focus on, but that&#x27;s also what your clients are going to value more from you,\" Shah said.The competitive landscape: Marble faces well-funded rivals and legacy giantsMarble enters a market with formidable incumbents and well-funded competitors. BlueJ, a global tax research platform, has raised over $100 million. Thomson Reuters, CCH, and Intuit have deep customer relationships built over decades.But the founders see opportunity in the transition moment.\"AI has changed what’s possible in the industry,\" Shah said. \"We are going to work with and integrate with some technology players in the industry and also compete with other players with new products powered by AI. In some cases we are going to forget about the existing technology solution for doing things and go back to the task itself. We have totally new technological capabilities — how would you design something from a blank canvas that works with humans to accomplish that task?\"\"The decision to offer a free research tool reflects Marble&#x27;s go-to-market philosophy. By giving practitioners access without a paywall, the company aims to build trust and demonstrate capability.\"It allows us to expose a really compelling product that is purpose-built to those that are worried about how to use AI or question how to adopt it. Now they don’t have to think about purchasing something that is cost-prohibitive when they don&#x27;t know how to integrate it into their workflow,\" Shah said.The $250 billion question: Can a startup transform how America does its taxes?Marble&#x27;s roadmap extends beyond research. The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today&#x27;s tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble&#x27;s bet is that AI can flip that equation.\"Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning,\" Konrad said. \"How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?\"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry&#x27;s demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more.\"AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them. We believe AI is ultimately going to make accounting firms’ businesses better and more profitable and at the same time end clients will get better services at better prices,\" Shah said.The accounting profession, it seems, is about to find out which side of that equation it lands on.",

Now they don’t have to think about purchasing something that is cost-prohibitive when they don&#x27;t know how to integrate it into their workflow,\" Shah said.The $250 billion question: Can a startup transform how America does its taxes?Marble&#x27;s roadmap extends beyond research. The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today&#x27;s tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble&#x27;s bet is that AI can flip that equation.\"Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning,\" Konrad said. \"How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?\"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry&#x27;s demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more.\"AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them. We believe AI is ultimately going to make accounting firms’ businesses better and more profitable and at the same time end clients will get better services at better prices,\" Shah said.The accounting profession, it seems, is about to find out which side of that equation it lands on.",

          "standfirst": "Nous Research, the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, released on Tuesday an open-source mathematical reasoning system called Nomos 1 that achieved near-elite human performance on this year&#x27;s William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, one of the most prestigious and notoriously difficult undergraduate math contests in the world.The Putnam is known for its difficulty: While a perfect score is 120, this year&#x27;s top score was 90, and the median was just 2. Nomos 1, by contrast, scored 87 points — a result that would have ranked second out of 3,988 participants in the 2024 competition, according to the company.The release marks an inflection point in the rapidly accelerating race to build AI systems capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning. Unlike the massive, compute-intensive models deployed by major technology companies, Nomos 1 achieves its results with a relatively compact architecture: 30 billion parameters with roughly 3 billion active at any given time, using a mixture-of-experts design based on Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3 model.\"This score would rank #2/3988 in 2024 and marks our first step with Hillclimb AI towards creating a SOTA AI mathematician,\" Nous Research announced on social media Tuesday.The same base model scored 24 points without Nous Research&#x27;s specialized trainingPerhaps most striking is the gap between Nomos 1 and its base model. When Nous Research ran the same Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 model through an identical testing harness, it scored just 24 out of 120 — a result that underscores the critical importance of post-training optimization and specialized reasoning techniques over raw model scale.\"Nomos 1 achieved an 87/120 with 8 perfect scores,\" the company stated, noting that the performance difference \"is largely due to post-training and data quality rather than the harness.\"The results were verified through blind grading by a human expert who had previously finished in the top 200 on the Putnam. Nous Research provided the anonymized submissions to the grader, then published the full set of de-anonymized files and the runbooks used to generate them on GitHub.Why the Putnam competition is considered the ultimate test of mathematical reasoningThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada. It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the world.The notoriously brutal William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is more of a mathematical sporting event than an academic test. The exam consists of two 3-hour sessions separated by a 2-hour break. There are a total of 12 questions to be solved, 6 for each session. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 120 points.Putnam questions are not the type that come up in regular exams or textbooks. They are more like puzzles than calculations, often requiring students to find different ways to represent things before a solution might unfold.Last year, nearly 4,000 students across the continent wrote the Putnam. Sixty-one per cent scored three points or fewer, according to the Mathematical Association of America, which organizes the competition. The top score was 90 out of 120.Many Putnam Fellows have gone on to become distinguished researchers in mathematics and other fields, including three Fields Medalists — John Milnor, David Mumford, and Daniel Quillen — and two Nobel laureates in physics — Richard Feynman and Kenneth Wilson.Inside the two-phase reasoning system that powers Nomos 1&#x27;s mathematical breakthroughsNomos 1 is a specialization of Qwen&#x27;s Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking model, optimized for mathematical problem-solving and proof-writing in natural language. The system was developed in collaboration with Hillclimb AI.What distinguishes Nomos 1 from simple model inference is its sophisticated reasoning harness — an open-source framework that orchestrates how the model approaches and solves problems. The harness operates in two distinct phases within a three-hour time limit, mirroring the actual Putnam competition structure.In the solving phase, parallel workers simultaneously tackle problems using a priority-based system. Each worker picks a problem, generates a submission, then scores its own work on a scale of 1 to 7. Problems with the fewest perfect scores receive priority, ensuring the system focuses its compute on the hardest challenges. This process continues until either all problems have achieved a target number of self-critiqued perfect scores or time runs out.The finalization phase begins 15 minutes before the time limit (or at 50% for shorter runs) and employs a two-stage selection process. First, a consolidation step groups submissions by conclusion and attempts to identify the correct group — importantly, not necessarily the majority group. Then, a pairwise tournament using single elimination determines the final submission for each problem.\"Our open source reasoning system consists of a solving phase, where workers attempt a least-solved problem and self-assess, followed by a finalization phase, which consolidates submissions to choose a final submission for each problem,\" Nous Research explained.How Nomos 1 compares to mathematical AI systems from DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAIThe Nomos 1 results arrive amid a flurry of advances in mathematical reasoning AI. DeepSeek&#x27;s model, DeepSeekMath-V2, scored 118 out of 120 points on questions from the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, beating the top human score of 90. The model also performed at the level of gold-medal winners in the International Mathematical Olympiad.This year, Google&#x27;s advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit. They achieved this year&#x27;s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think.What makes Nomos 1&#x27;s achievement notable is not raw performance — it trails DeepSeek&#x27;s 118/120 — but rather its accessibility and efficiency. At 30 billion parameters with only 3 billion active, the model can run on consumer-grade hardware, a stark contrast to the massive compute clusters required by frontier models from OpenAI and Google.Hermes 4.3 arrived just six days earlier, trained on a decentralized blockchain networkThe Nomos 1 announcement follows closely on the heels of Nous Research&#x27;s December 3 release of Hermes 4.3, a general-purpose language model that marked another significant milestone for the company.Hermes 4.3, based on ByteDance&#x27;s Seed-OSS-36B-Base model, is the first production model that Nous Research trained entirely on its Psyche network — a distributed training infrastructure that uses a novel optimizer called DisTrO to coordinate training across nodes spread throughout data centers over the open internet, secured by consensus on the Solana blockchain.The company trained Hermes 4.3 both through traditional centralized methods and on the Psyche network, specifically to verify that distributed training could match or exceed centralized performance for production workloads. The Psyche-trained version outperformed the centralized version across a suite of downstream tasks, the company reported.\"The training run proved stable throughout, averaging 144k tokens/second spread across 24 Psyche nodes,\" Nous Research stated. \"Using DisTrO&#x27;s overlapped collective strategy, the entirety of the P2P communications were hidden by the training time, effectively achieving equivalent throughput to traditional, centralized training.\"Hermes 4.3 also achieved state-of-the-art results on RefusalBench, a new benchmark that measures a model&#x27;s willingness to be helpful across a variety of scenarios commonly restricted by other models. The model answered 74.60% of RefusalBench questions in non-reasoning mode, surpassing its predecessor Hermes 4 70B (59.50%) and outperforming closed models including Grok 4 (51.30%) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (24.23%).Small models with smart training are closing the gap with trillion-parameter giantsTogether, the two releases in a single week signal Nous Research&#x27;s strategic bet: that smaller, more efficient models with sophisticated post-training techniques and reasoning harnesses can compete with — and in some cases outperform — the massive models developed by better-funded competitors.For enterprise decision-makers, the implications are significant. Mathematical reasoning capabilities have applications far beyond academic competitions: they&#x27;re essential for formal verification, theorem proving, scientific modeling, cryptographic analysis, and any domain requiring rigorous logical deduction.The open-source nature of both releases — Nomos 1 is available under the Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face, with the full reasoning harness on GitHub — means that organizations can deploy these capabilities on their own infrastructure without relying on API calls to major cloud providers.\"For the first time, anyone can run or access a state-of-the-art AI mathematician,\" one observer noted on social media. \"This lowers the barrier to serious math research, proof verification, modeling complex systems, advanced reasoning work.\"The key contributors to Nomos 1 include Roger Jin, who led the training; Jeffrey Quesnelle and Dakota Mahan, who built the infrastructure; Chen Guang, who advised; and Ryan Teknium and Jeffrey Quesnelle, who provided leadership. The model was developed with contributions from Hillclimb AI and a team of math experts including Samuel Kim, Miron Yurkevich, and others.The race to build AI mathematicians is accelerating faster than anyone predictedThe 86th Putnam Competition took place on Saturday, December 6, 2025 — just three days before Nous Research released Nomos 1. The timing underscores how rapidly the field is moving: companies are now releasing mathematical AI systems capable of near-elite human performance within days of the competitions they&#x27;re designed to solve.Competition in mathematical AI has intensified dramatically in recent months. In July, an advanced version of Google DeepMind&#x27;s Gemini model and an experimental reasoning model from OpenAI both achieved gold status on the IMO 2025. DeepSeek&#x27;s new model matched their performance, solving 5 out of 6 problems.But the resource requirements for those frontier systems remain prohibitive for most organizations. OpenAI&#x27;s o1-pro is estimated at over 1.8 trillion parameters; Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro likely exceeds 400 billion. Nomos 1, by contrast, achieves competitive results with a fraction of that footprint.The gap between massive frontier models and efficient open-source alternatives is narrowing. And for organizations that need mathematical reasoning capabilities without the budget for hyperscale compute, that gap may have just closed enough to matter.As one observer put it on social media: \"This marks a significant jump for AI math models that are small enough to run on your laptop.\"A laptop that can now outperform nearly 4,000 of the continent&#x27;s best undergraduate mathematicians.",

          "standfirst": "Presented by Oracle NetSuiteWhen any company tells you it is their biggest product release in almost three decades, it’s worth listening. When the person saying it founded the world’s first cloud computing company, it’s time to take note. At SuiteWorld 2025, Evan Goldberg, founder and EVP of Oracle NetSuite, did just that when he called NetSuite Next the company’s biggest product evolution in nearly three decades. But behind that sweeping vision lies a quieter shift — one centered on how AI behaves, not just what it can do. “Every company is experimenting with AI,” says Brian Chess, SVP of Technology and AI at NetSuite. “Some ideas hit the mark, and some don’t, but each one teaches us something. That’s how innovation works.”For Chess and Gary Wiessinger, SVP of Application Development at NetSuite, the challenge lies in governing AI responsibly. Rather than reinventing its system, NetSuite is extending the same principles into the AI era that have guided its strategy for 27 years — security, control, and auditability. The goal is to make AI actions traceable, permissions enforceable, and outcomes auditable.The philosophy underpins what Chess calls a “glass-box” approach to enterprise AI, where decisions are visible and every agent operates within human-defined guardrails.Built on Oracle’s foundationNetSuite Next is the result of five years of development. It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer.“We are building a fantastic foundation on OCI,” Chess says. “That infrastructure provides more than compute power.” Built on the same OCI foundation that powers NetSuite today, NetSuite Next gives customers access to Oracle’s latest AI innovations along with the performance, scalability, and security of OCI’s enterprise-grade platform.Wiessinger emphasizes the team&#x27;s approach as “needs first, technology second.”“We don’t take a technology-first approach,” he says. “We take a customer-needs-first approach and then figure out how to use the latest technology to solve those needs better.”That philosophy extends across Oracle’s ecosystem. NetSuite’s collaboration with Oracle’s AI Database, Fusion Applications, Analytics, and Cloud Infrastructure teams helps NetSuite deliver capabilities that independent vendors can’t match, he says — an AI system that is both open to innovation and grounded in Oracle’s security and scale.The data structure advantageAt the heart of the platform is a structured data model that serves as a critical advantage.“One of the great things about NetSuite is, because the data comes in and it gets structured, the connections between the data are explicit,” Chess explains. “That means the AI can start exploring that knowledge graph that the company has been building up.”Where general LLMs sift through unstructured text, NetSuite’s AI works from structured data, identifying precise links between transactions, accounts, and workflows to deliver context-aware insights. Wiessinger adds, “The data we have spans financials, CRM, commerce, and HR. We can do more for customers because we see more of their business in one place.” Combined with built-in business logic and metadata, that scope allows NetSuite to generate recommendations and insights that are accurate and explainable.Oracle’s Redwood design system provides the visual layer for this data intelligence, creating what Goldberg described as a \"modern, clean and intuitive\" workspace where AI and humans collaborate naturally.Designing for accountabilityOne downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”That visibility turns AI into a learning engine. As Chess puts it, transparency becomes a “fantastic teacher,” helping organizations understand, improve, and trust automation over time.But Chess cautions against blind trust: “What’s disturbing is when someone presents something to me and says, ‘Look what AI gave me,’ as if that makes it authoritative. People need to ask, ‘What grounded this? Why is it correct?’” NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.Governance by designAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries.Wiessinger puts it plainly: “If AI generates a narrative summary of a report and it’s 80% of what the user would have written, that’s fine. We’ll learn from their feedback and make it even better. But booking to the general ledger is different. That has to be 100% correct and is where controls and human review really matter.”Auditing the algorithmAuditing has always been part of ERP’s DNA, and NetSuite now extends that discipline to AI. Every agent action, workflow adjustment, and model-generated code snippet is recorded within the system’s existing audit framework. As Chess explains, “It’s the same audit trail you might use to figure out what the humans did. Code is auditable. When the LLM creates code and something happens in the system, we can trace back.”That traceability transforms AI from a black box into a glass box. When an algorithm accelerates a payment or flags an anomaly, teams can see exactly which inputs and logic produced the decision — an essential safeguard for regulated industries and finance teams.Safe extensibilityThe other half of trust is freedom — the ability to extend AI without risking data exposure.The NetSuite AI Connector Service and SuiteCloud Platform make that possible. Through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), customers can connect external language models while keeping sensitive data secure inside Oracle’s environment.“Businesses are hungry for AI,” Chess says. “They want to start putting it to work. But they also want to know those experiments can’t go off the rails. The NetSuite AI Connector Service and governance model give partners the freedom to innovate while maintaining the same audit and permission logic that govern native features.”Culture, experimentation, and guardrailsGovernance frameworks only work if people use them wisely. Both executives see AI adoption as a top-down and bottom-up process.“The board is telling the CEO they need an AI strategy,” Chess says. “Meanwhile, employees are already using AI. If I were a CEO, I’d start by asking: what are you already doing, and what’s working?”Wiessinger agrees that balance is key: “Some companies go all-in on a centralized AI team while others let everyone experiment freely. Neither works by itself. You need structure for major initiatives and freedom for grassroots innovation.”He offers a simple example: “Write an email? Go crazy. Touch financials or employee data? Don’t go crazy with that.”Experimentation, both emphasize, is imperative. “No one should wait for us or anyone else,” Wiessinger says. “Start testing, learn quickly, and be intentional about making it work for your business.”Why transparent AI winsAs AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.In a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer.“We are building a fantastic foundation on OCI,” Chess says. “That infrastructure provides more than compute power.” Built on the same OCI foundation that powers NetSuite today, NetSuite Next gives customers access to Oracle’s latest AI innovations along with the performance, scalability, and security of OCI’s enterprise-grade platform.Wiessinger emphasizes the team&#x27;s approach as “needs first, technology second.”“We don’t take a technology-first approach,” he says. “We take a customer-needs-first approach and then figure out how to use the latest technology to solve those needs better.”That philosophy extends across Oracle’s ecosystem. NetSuite’s collaboration with Oracle’s AI Database, Fusion Applications, Analytics, and Cloud Infrastructure teams helps NetSuite deliver capabilities that independent vendors can’t match, he says — an AI system that is both open to innovation and grounded in Oracle’s security and scale.The data structure advantageAt the heart of the platform is a structured data model that serves as a critical advantage.“One of the great things about NetSuite is, because the data comes in and it gets structured, the connections between the data are explicit,” Chess explains. “That means the AI can start exploring that knowledge graph that the company has been building up.”Where general LLMs sift through unstructured text, NetSuite’s AI works from structured data, identifying precise links between transactions, accounts, and workflows to deliver context-aware insights. Wiessinger adds, “The data we have spans financials, CRM, commerce, and HR. We can do more for customers because we see more of their business in one place.” Combined with built-in business logic and metadata, that scope allows NetSuite to generate recommendations and insights that are accurate and explainable.Oracle’s Redwood design system provides the visual layer for this data intelligence, creating what Goldberg described as a \"modern, clean and intuitive\" workspace where AI and humans collaborate naturally.Designing for accountabilityOne downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”That visibility turns AI into a learning engine. As Chess puts it, transparency becomes a “fantastic teacher,” helping organizations understand, improve, and trust automation over time.But Chess cautions against blind trust: “What’s disturbing is when someone presents something to me and says, ‘Look what AI gave me,’ as if that makes it authoritative. People need to ask, ‘What grounded this? Why is it correct?’” NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.Governance by designAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries.Wiessinger puts it plainly: “If AI generates a narrative summary of a report and it’s 80% of what the user would have written, that’s fine. We’ll learn from their feedback and make it even better. But booking to the general ledger is different. That has to be 100% correct and is where controls and human review really matter.”Auditing the algorithmAuditing has always been part of ERP’s DNA, and NetSuite now extends that discipline to AI. Every agent action, workflow adjustment, and model-generated code snippet is recorded within the system’s existing audit framework. As Chess explains, “It’s the same audit trail you might use to figure out what the humans did. Code is auditable. When the LLM creates code and something happens in the system, we can trace back.”That traceability transforms AI from a black box into a glass box. When an algorithm accelerates a payment or flags an anomaly, teams can see exactly which inputs and logic produced the decision — an essential safeguard for regulated industries and finance teams.Safe extensibilityThe other half of trust is freedom — the ability to extend AI without risking data exposure.The NetSuite AI Connector Service and SuiteCloud Platform make that possible. Through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), customers can connect external language models while keeping sensitive data secure inside Oracle’s environment.“Businesses are hungry for AI,” Chess says. “They want to start putting it to work. But they also want to know those experiments can’t go off the rails. The NetSuite AI Connector Service and governance model give partners the freedom to innovate while maintaining the same audit and permission logic that govern native features.”Culture, experimentation, and guardrailsGovernance frameworks only work if people use them wisely. Both executives see AI adoption as a top-down and bottom-up process.“The board is telling the CEO they need an AI strategy,” Chess says. “Meanwhile, employees are already using AI. If I were a CEO, I’d start by asking: what are you already doing, and what’s working?”Wiessinger agrees that balance is key: “Some companies go all-in on a centralized AI team while others let everyone experiment freely. Neither works by itself. You need structure for major initiatives and freedom for grassroots innovation.”He offers a simple example: “Write an email? Go crazy. Touch financials or employee data? Don’t go crazy with that.”Experimentation, both emphasize, is imperative. “No one should wait for us or anyone else,” Wiessinger says. “Start testing, learn quickly, and be intentional about making it work for your business.”Why transparent AI winsAs AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.In a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "content": "Google has increasingly moved toward keeping features locked to its hardware products, but the Translate app is bucking that trend. The live translate feature is breaking out of the Google bubble with support for any earbuds you happen to have connected to your Android phone. The app is also getting improved translation quality across dozens of languages and some Duolingo-like learning features. The latest version of Google’s live translation is built on Gemini and initially rolled out earlier this year. It supports smooth back-and-forth translations as both on-screen text and audio. Beginning a live translate session in Google Translate used to require Pixel Buds, but that won’t be the case going forward. Google says a beta test of expanded headphone support is launching today in the US, Mexico, and India. The audio translation attempts to preserve the tone and cadence of the original speaker, but it’s not as capable as the full AI-reproduced voice translations you can do on the latest Pixel phones. Google says this feature should work on any earbuds or headphones, but it’s only for Android right now. The feature will expand to iOS in the coming months. Apple does have a similar live translation feature on the iPhone, but it requires AirPods.Read full article Comments",

And many amputees who tried advanced bionic hands apparently didn’t like them. “Up to 50 percent of people with upper limb amputation abandon these prostheses, never to use them again,” says Jake George, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of Utah. The main issue with bionic hands that drives users away from them, George explains, is that they’re difficult to control. “Our goal was making such bionic arms more intuitive, so that users could go about their tasks without having to think about it,” George says. To make this happen, his team came up with an AI bionic hand co-pilot. Micro-management issues Bionic hands’ control problems stem largely from their lack of autonomy. Grasping a paper cup without crushing it or catching a ball mid-flight appear so effortless because our natural movements rely on an elaborate system of reflexes and feedback loops. When an object you hold begins to slip, tiny mechanoreceptors in your fingertips send signals to the nervous system that make the hand tighten its grip. This all happens within 60 to 80 milliseconds—before you even consciously notice. This reflex is just one of many ways your brain automatically assists you in dexterity-based tasks.Read full article Comments",

Trump’s executive order tells the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and other federal agencies to take a variety of actions. “My Administration must act with the Congress to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard—not 50 discordant State ones. The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order… Until such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my Administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation,” Trump’s order said. The order claims that state laws, such as one passed in Colorado, “are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models.” Congressional Republicans recently decided not to include a Trump-backed plan to block state AI laws in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), although it could be included in other legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has also failed to get congressional backing for legislation that would punish states with AI laws.Read full article Comments",

That contempt of court finding has now been almost entirely upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a development that Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney tells Ars he hopes will “do a lot of good for developers and start to really change the App Store situation worldwide, I think.” The ruling, signed by a panel of three appellate court judges, affirmed that Apple’s initial attempts to charge a 27 percent fee to iOS developers using outside payment options “had a prohibitive effect, in violation of the injunction.” Similarly, Apple’s restrictions on how those outside links had to be designed were overly broad; the appeals court suggests that Apple can only ensure that internal and external payment options are presented in a similar fashion. The appeals court also agreed that Apple acted in “bad faith” by refusing to comply with the injunction, rejecting viable, compliant alternatives in internal discussions. And the appeals court was also not convinced by Apple’s process-focused arguments, saying the district court properly evaluated materials Apple argued were protected by attorney-client privilege.Read full article Comments",

That was the unfortunate and alarming case for a man in the UK several years ago, according to a case report this week in BMJ Case Reports. The man, who was in his 50s and otherwise healthy, showed up at a hospital after the entire left side of his body abruptly went numb and he was left with clumsy, uncoordinated muscle movements (ataxia). His blood pressure was astonishingly high, at 254/150 mm Hg. For context, a normal reading is under 120/80, while anything over 180/120 is considered a hypertensive crisis, which is a medical emergency. The man had suffered a mild stroke, and his extremely high blood pressure was an obvious factor. But why his blood pressure had reached stratospheric heights was far less obvious to his doctors, according to the retrospective case report written by Martha Coyle and Sunil Munshi of Nottingham University Hospital.Read full article Comments",

GWM-1 is a blanket term for a trio of autoregression models, each built on top of Runway’s Gen-4.5 text-to-video generation model and then post-trained with domain-specific data for different kinds of applications.

K2’s Series C fundraising round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with additional funding from investment firms in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. K2 has now raised more than $400 million since its founding in 2022 and is on track to launch its first major demonstration mission next year, officials said. K2 aims to take advantage of a coming abundance of heavy- and super-heavy-lift launch capacity, with SpaceX’s Starship expected to begin deploying satellites as soon as next year. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket launched twice this year and will fly more in 2026 while engineers develop an even larger New Glenn with additional engines and more lift capability.Read full article Comments",

A new report offers a glimpse into the problems associated with the new market, including the misuse of AI companies’ large language models (LLMs). In a blog post today, the US Public Interest Group Education Fund (PIRG) reported its findings after testing AI toys (PDF). It described AI toys as online devices with integrated microphones that let users talk to the toy, which uses a chatbot to respond. AI toys are currently a niche market, but they could be set to grow. More consumer companies have been eager to shoehorn AI technology into their products so they can do more, cost more, and potentially give companies user tracking and advertising data. A partnership between OpenAI and Mattel announced this year could also create a wave of AI-based toys from the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, as well as its competitors.Read full article Comments",

Hudson, who will serve as director on the new game, said in an interview with StarWars.com that he has remained in contact with Lucasfilm since the KOTOR days, in the hopes of being able to collaborate in the Star Wars universe again. “It took the right conditions to get everything to line up,” he told the site. Calling KOTOR “one of the defining experiences of my career,” Hudson said he wants to “explore a contemporary vision” of the Star Wars universe and “deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars” that defined the original games. As director on the upcoming game, Hudson said he sees his role as “to gather and shape a cohesive vision that the entire team contributes to. Ensuring that everyone shares that vision and understands their part in creating it is critical to the success of a project.”Read full article Comments",

Now, after nine years of development—and his fair share of outspoken, controversial statements—Blow is finally approaching the finish line on that “short game.” He said Order of the Sinking Star—which was announced Thursday via a Game Awards trailer ahead of a planned 2026 release—now encompasses around 1,400 individual puzzles that could take completionists 400 to 500 hours to fully conquer.

Shortly after that launch, though, players quickly discovered a way to make their houses float high above the ground by exploiting an unintended, invisible UI glitch. Now, Blizzard says that the overwhelming response to that accidental house hovering has been so strong that it’s pivoting to integrate it as an official part of the game. “We were going to fix flying houses to bring them back to terra firma, but you all made such awesome stuff, so we made it possible with the base UI instead,” WoW Principal Designer Jesse Kurlancheek posted on social media Tuesday. Lead Producer Kyle Hartline followed up on that announcement with some behind-the-scenes gossip: “Like no joke we had an ops channel about how to roll out the float fix but folks shared like 5 of the dopest houses and we all kinda immediately agreed this was way too cool to change,” he wrote.Read full article Comments",

Plans for a Supergirl movie date all the way back to 2018, but the merger that produced Warner Bros. Discovery scuttled the original concept. James Gunn and Peter Safran came in as co-CEOs of the new DC Studios and announced plans for a “soft reboot” of the DC universe, starting with this summer’s Superman. Sasha Calle played Supergirl for a brief appearance in 2023’s The Flash, but despite having signed a multi-year contract, Gunn and Safran decided to go in a different direction for their standalone film and cast Alcock (House of the Dragon) instead. Gunn particularly wanted to distance this new version of Supergirl from earlier incarnations, especially how the character was portrayed by Melissa Benoist in the Arrowverse series that ran from 2015–2021. He wanted someone less earnest, more of a contrast to David Corenswet’s wholesome Superman. “This is a story-based medium; we want stories to be in theaters that are cool and different from each other,” Gunn said at a media briefing. “And this movie is not exactly just a female clone of Superman. It’s its own thing entirely. And with a character who’s equally worthy of this treatment.”Read full article Comments",
