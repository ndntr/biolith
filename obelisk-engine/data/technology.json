          "standfirst": "To see a film the way the creators intended, you really need a projector. A good one can show a bright, sharp image up to 250 inches in size for an immersive experience that no TV can match — and usually at a much lower price. Plus, they’re great for immersive gaming with consoles and PCs.Thanks to companies like Anker and Valerion, projectors are starting to be seen as a must-have item for cinephiles and outdoor party screenings alike. That means there are a wide variety of choices, ranging from classic ceiling-mounted models to battery-powered projectors you can take on a camping trick. You can also choose from dozens of ultra short throw (UST) models for a more TV-like installation.But compared to TVs, projectors remain a bit more confusing for a majority of buyers. This guide will fill you in on important details to consider like brightness, type (classic, portable and ultra short throw) and other factors to help you choose the best model for your setup. Best projectors for 2026 Some projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one. What to consider when buying a projector For a deep dive on projector technology check my previous explainer, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean. Brightness and contrast Brightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important for detail, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections. Laser projectors offer the most brightness and they are entering the mainstream with models costing well under $2,000. Below that, you’re looking at projectors with bulbs. Aside from brightness, laser projectors have an advantage in that the light source lasts 10,000 hours or more, compared to 2,000 hours maximum for bulb projectors. DLP vs LCD Digital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time. Resolution If you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use 2K projectors for various reasons). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution. HDR and color accuracy Projectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called tone mapping to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors. UST vs. classic Classic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens. Elite Starling Mounting and fan noise Ceiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others. Optics For more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a \"keystone correction\" to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models. Gaming and streaming If you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and <20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle. Screens Should you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light. Best projector FAQs Are 4K projectors better? Yes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important. Is a projector better than a TV? Projectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use. Is 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector? Yes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day. Should I get a 4K or 1080p projector? That depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford. What are the best projectors in daylight? The best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000. Do you need a screen for a better projector experience? Technically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater. Should I buy a portable or home projector? It depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss",

Treating retrieval as a lightweight enhancement to inference logic obscures its growing role as a systemic risk surface.Retrieval freshness is a systems problem, not a tuning problemFreshness failures rarely originate in embedding models.

This includes measuring recall under policy constraints, monitoring freshness drift and detecting bias introduced by retrieval pathways.In production environments, evaluation tends to break once retrieval becomes autonomous rather than human-triggered. Teams continue to score answer quality on sampled prompts, but lack visibility into what was retrieved, what was missed or whether stale or unauthorized context influenced decisions.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s AirTag is designed to run quietly in the background, helping you keep track of everyday items like keys, bags and luggage. Unlike many small trackers, an AirTag doesn’t need to be charged. Instead, it uses a standard replaceable coin cell battery that typically lasts around a year, depending on usage.When the battery runs low, your iPhone will alert you. Replacing it is a simple process that takes just a few minutes and doesn’t require any tools. This guide explains how to tell when your AirTag battery needs replacing, which battery to use and how to swap it safely.How to replace the battery in your AirTagReplacing the battery only takes a few steps.Hold the AirTag with the polished stainless steel side facing up. Press down firmly on the metal battery cover and rotate it counterclockwise. Continue turning until the cover stops moving.Lift off the cover and remove the old battery.Insert a new CR2032 battery with the positive (+) side facing up. Once the battery is seated correctly, the AirTag will emit a brief chime, confirming that power has been restored.Place the battery cover back onto the AirTag. Align the three small tabs on the cover with the matching slots on the AirTag body.Press down gently and rotate the cover clockwise until it stops. The cover should sit flush with the AirTag and feel secure once locked into place.No pairing or setup steps are required after replacing the battery. Your AirTag will automatically reconnect to your Apple ID.When to replace your AirTag batteryYour iPhone will automatically notify you when an AirTag battery is running low. The alert appears as a notification and doesn’t interrupt tracking, but it’s a good idea to replace the battery quickly to avoid losing location updates.If you’re unsure whether your AirTag battery needs replacing, open the Find My app, tap the Items tab and select your AirTag. If a message appears under the AirTag name stating “Low Battery”, you’ll know it needs replacing. If no message appears, it’s safe to assume the battery level is fine for now. AirTags don’t have a screen or any other battery indicator, but Apple does show a battery percentage for AirTags in the FindMy app. The low battery warning is the only signal Apple provides before replacement becomes necessary.What to do if your AirTag doesn’t make a soundIf you don’t hear a sound after inserting the new battery, remove it and check that it’s oriented correctly with the positive side facing up. You should also secure the back cover onto the AirTag as well, to see if the chime sounds after that.If the battery is oriented properly and still doesn’t trigger a sound, try a different CR2032 battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 lithium 3V coin battery, a common type available at most electronics stores, supermarkets and pharmacies.

          "content": "Apple’s AirTag is designed to run quietly in the background, helping you keep track of everyday items like keys, bags and luggage. Unlike many small trackers, an AirTag doesn’t need to be charged. Instead, it uses a standard replaceable coin cell battery that typically lasts around a year, depending on usage.When the battery runs low, your iPhone will alert you. Replacing it is a simple process that takes just a few minutes and doesn’t require any tools. This guide explains how to tell when your AirTag battery needs replacing, which battery to use and how to swap it safely.How to replace the battery in your AirTagReplacing the battery only takes a few steps.Hold the AirTag with the polished stainless steel side facing up. Press down firmly on the metal battery cover and rotate it counterclockwise. Continue turning until the cover stops moving.Lift off the cover and remove the old battery.Insert a new CR2032 battery with the positive (+) side facing up. Once the battery is seated correctly, the AirTag will emit a brief chime, confirming that power has been restored.Place the battery cover back onto the AirTag. Align the three small tabs on the cover with the matching slots on the AirTag body.Press down gently and rotate the cover clockwise until it stops. The cover should sit flush with the AirTag and feel secure once locked into place.No pairing or setup steps are required after replacing the battery. Your AirTag will automatically reconnect to your Apple ID.When to replace your AirTag batteryYour iPhone will automatically notify you when an AirTag battery is running low. The alert appears as a notification and doesn’t interrupt tracking, but it’s a good idea to replace the battery quickly to avoid losing location updates.If you’re unsure whether your AirTag battery needs replacing, open the Find My app, tap the Items tab and select your AirTag. If a message appears under the AirTag name stating “Low Battery”, you’ll know it needs replacing. If no message appears, it’s safe to assume the battery level is fine for now. AirTags don’t have a screen or any other battery indicator, but Apple does show a battery percentage for AirTags in the FindMy app. The low battery warning is the only signal Apple provides before replacement becomes necessary.What to do if your AirTag doesn’t make a soundIf you don’t hear a sound after inserting the new battery, remove it and check that it’s oriented correctly with the positive side facing up. You should also secure the back cover onto the AirTag as well, to see if the chime sounds after that.If the battery is oriented properly and still doesn’t trigger a sound, try a different CR2032 battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 lithium 3V coin battery, a common type available at most electronics stores, supermarkets and pharmacies. Some batteries, particularly those with thick coatings, may not make consistent contact. Apple suggests looking for packaging that states “Compatible with AirTag.” Once a working battery is installed, the AirTag should resume normal operation immediately.How often should you replace your AirTag batteryMost AirTag batteries last about a year under typical use.

          "standfirst": "By now, many enterprises have deployed some form of RAG. The promise is seductive: index your PDFs, connect an LLM and instantly democratize your corporate knowledge.But for industries dependent on heavy engineering, the reality has been underwhelming. Engineers ask specific questions about infrastructure, and the bot hallucinates.The failure isn&#x27;t in the LLM. The failure is in the preprocessing.Standard RAG pipelines treat documents as flat strings of text. They use \"fixed-size chunking\" (cutting a document every 500 characters). This works for prose, but it destroys the logic of technical manuals. It slices tables in half, severs captions from images, and ignores the visual hierarchy of the page.Improving RAG reliability isn&#x27;t about buying a bigger model; it&#x27;s about fixing the \"dark data\" problem through semantic chunking and multimodal textualization.Here is the architectural framework for building a RAG system that can actually read a manual.The fallacy of fixed-size chunkingIn a standard Python RAG tutorial, you split text by character count. In an enterprise PDF, this is disastrous.If a safety specification table spans 1,000 tokens, and your chunk size is 500, you have just split the \"voltage limit\" header from the \"240V\" value. The vector database stores them separately. When a user asks, \"What is the voltage limit?\", the retrieval system finds the header but not the value. The LLM, forced to answer, often guesses.The solution: Semantic chunkingThe first step to fixing production RAG is abandoning arbitrary character counts in favor of document intelligence.Using layout-aware parsing tools (such as Azure Document Intelligence), we can segment data based on document structure such as chapters, sections and paragraphs, rather than token count.Logical cohesion: A section describing a specific machine part is kept as a single vector, even if it varies in length.Table preservation: The parser identifies a table boundary and forces the entire grid into a single chunk, preserving the row-column relationships that are vital for accurate retrieval.In our internal qualitative benchmarks, moving from fixed to semantic chunking significantly improved the retrieval accuracy of tabular data, effectively stopping the fragmentation of technical specs.Unlocking visual dark dataThe second failure mode of enterprise RAG is blindness. A massive amount of corporate IP exists not in text, but in flowcharts, schematics and system architecture diagrams. Standard embedding models (like text-embedding-3-small) cannot \"see\" these images. They are skipped during indexing.If your answer lies in a flowchart, your RAG system will say, \"I don&#x27;t know.\"The solution: Multimodal textualizationTo make diagrams searchable, we implemented a multimodal preprocessing step using vision-capable models (specifically GPT-4o) before the data ever hits the vector store.OCR extraction: High-precision optical character recognition pulls text labels from within the image.Generative captioning: The vision model analyzes the image and generates a detailed natural language description (\"A flowchart showing that process A leads to process B if the temperature exceeds 50 degrees\").Hybrid embedding: This generated description is embedded and stored as metadata linked to the original image.Now, when a user searches for \"temperature process flow,\" the vector search matches the description, even though the original source was a PNG file.The trust layer: Evidence-based UIFor enterprise adoption, accuracy is only half the battle. The other half is verifiability.In a standard RAG interface, the chatbot gives a text answer and cites a filename. This forces the user to download the PDF and hunt for the page to verify the claim. For high-stakes queries (\"Is this chemical flammable?\"), users simply won&#x27;t trust the bot.The architecture should implement visual citation. Because we preserved the link between the text chunk and its parent image during the preprocessing phase, the UI can display the exact chart or table used to generate the answer alongside the text response.This \"show your work\" mechanism allows humans to verify the AI&#x27;s reasoning instantly, bridging the trust gap that kills so many internal AI projects.Future-proofing: Native multimodal embeddingsWhile the \"textualization\" method (converting images to text descriptions) is the practical solution for today, the architecture is rapidly evolving.We are already seeing the emergence of native multimodal embeddings (such as Cohere’s Embed 4). These models can map text and images into the same vector space without the intermediate step of captioning. While we currently use a multi-stage pipeline for maximum control, the future of data infrastructure will likely involve \"end-to-end\" vectorization where the layout of a page is embedded directly.Furthermore, as long context LLMs become cost-effective, the need for chunking may diminish. We may soon pass entire manuals into the context window. However, until latency and cost for million-token calls drop significantly, semantic preprocessing remains the most economically viable strategy for real-time systems.ConclusionThe difference between a RAG demo and a production system is how it handles the messy reality of enterprise data.Stop treating your documents as simple strings of text. If you want your AI to understand your business, you must respect the structure of your documents.

          "standfirst": "Apple has steadily expanded the Apple Watch’s health monitoring features over the years, moving beyond fitness tracking into areas that can offer early insight into potential medical concerns. One of the most recent additions is hypertension alerts, which are designed to notify users when their blood pressure trends are elevated over time. While Apple Watches cannot directly measure blood pressure, this feature can still play a useful role in highlighting patterns that may be worth discussing with your doctor. Here, we’ll explain what hypertension alerts do, how they work and how to enable and manage them on the Apple Watch.What hypertension alerts doHypertension alerts are designed to identify long-term trends that may indicate elevated blood pressure. Instead of relying on a traditional cuff measurement, the Apple Watch analyzes a combination of health data collected over a 30-day period, including heart rate, movement patterns and other contextual information stored in the Health app. Using this data, the system looks for sustained changes that align with patterns commonly associated with hypertension.If your Apple Watch detects a trend suggesting elevated blood pressure over an extended period, it’ll send you a notification. These alerts are not intended to diagnose hypertension or replace medical testing. Instead, they serve as an early signal that something may have changed and that you may want to seek further monitoring or professional advice.Apple emphasizes that hypertension alerts are designed for users who have not already been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Instead, they are meant to raise awareness rather than confirm a condition.Who can use hypertension alertsHypertension alerts require a compatible Apple Watch model (Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later) paired with a supported iPhone (iPhone 11 or later). The feature also depends on recent versions of watchOS and iOS, as it relies on updated health algorithms and background data analysis. To use hypertension alerts you must be 22 years of age or older, not be pregnant and not have been diagnosed with hypertension. You also need to ensure that your Apple Watch’s Wrist Detection feature is turned on. To receive meaningful alerts, your Apple Watch needs sufficient data. This means wearing the watch regularly, including during sleep if sleep tracking is enabled, and keeping health details such as age, sex, height and weight up-to-date in the Health app. The system uses long-term trends, so alerts will not appear immediately after enabling the feature.How to turn on hypertension alertsHypertension alerts are managed through the Health app on the paired iPhone. The feature cannot be enabled directly from the watch itself. During setup, the Health app will ask for confirmation that the user has not been diagnosed with hypertension. It may also prompt a review of health details such as date of birth and biological sex, as this information helps improve the accuracy of trend analysis.To get started, open the Health app on the iPhone paired with the Apple Watch. From the main Health screen, tap your profile in the top corner. Select Health Checklist from the available Features. Next, you’ll need to tap Hypertension Notifications, confirm your age and whether or not you’ve ever been diagnosed with hypertension. Tap Continue and follow the on-screen prompts for information on how the notifications work. Once you have done this, tap Done and you’ll be all set. Once enabled, the feature runs automatically in the background. There is no need to manually start monitoring or interact with the feature daily.The new apple watch series 11 can help identify hypertensionAppleManaging notifications and alertsWhen hypertension alerts are turned on, notifications appear on both the Apple Watch and the paired iPhone. These alerts typically explain that a long-term trend suggesting elevated blood pressure has been detected, along with guidance on next steps.Users can manage how and when these notifications appear by adjusting notification settings for the Health app. This includes choosing whether alerts appear on the lock screen, in Notification Center or as time-sensitive notifications on Apple Watch.Health data related to hypertension alerts can be reviewed at any time in the Health app. While Apple Watch does not display a specific blood pressure number, users can view contextual information and educational material explaining what the alert means and what actions may be appropriate.How hypertension alerts can helpHypertension often develops gradually and may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Because of this, many people are unaware of elevated blood pressure until it is identified during a routine medical check.Hypertension alerts can let you know of subtle changes that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. For some users, an alert may prompt earlier conversations with a doctor, additional blood pressure monitoring at home or lifestyle changes such as adjustments to diet, activity or sleep habits.It is important to treat these notifications as informational rather than diagnostic. Apple Watch does not provide specific blood pressure readings and cannot confirm hypertension on its own.What to do if you receive an alertReceiving a hypertension alert does not mean that there is an immediate medical emergency. Apple recommends using the alert as a prompt to pay closer attention to your cardiovascular health.Many users choose to follow up by measuring blood pressure using a traditional cuff at home or by scheduling a check with a healthcare professional. A doctor can provide proper testing, diagnosis and guidance based on clinical measurements and individual risk factors.It is also worth reviewing lifestyle factors that can influence blood pressure, such as physical activity levels, sleep quality, stress and diet. Apple Watch can already help track many of these areas, which may provide useful context when discussing health concerns with a professional.Limitations to keep in mindHypertension alerts are not available in all regions and may be subject to regulatory approval. The feature also requires consistent Apple Watch use over time to generate reliable trend data.Most importantly, the Apple Watch does not measure blood pressure directly. The alerts are based on correlations and trends rather than direct readings, which means they should not be used as a substitute for medical equipment or professional care.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-turn-on-hypertension-alerts-on-apple-watch-130000090.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. There are tons of interesting games out this week. But first, there's been some discourse around the Nintendo Switch version of Dispatch, which arrived this week as well.On other platforms, there's an option to censor genitalia and other explicit content, but that's not present in the Switch version. Instead, such content is censored by default, with black rectangles covering up characters' bits and someone flipping the bird. Noises that suggest sexual pleasure are said to be toned down too.\"We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,\" developer AdHoc told EuroGamer. Nintendo later said in a statement to GoNintendo that it \"requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.\" There are other games available for the Switch and Switch 2 that feature nudity and explicit content. There have long been hentai games on the eShop, while mainstream games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 (we know all about the dongs in that one) still include explicit content on Nintendo platforms. So it's a bit of a strange one, and AdHoc and Nintendo didn't exactly clear things up with their statements. There's been speculation that AdHoc censored the game to comply with rules in Japan (Cyberpunk 2077 is censored there too) and that it opted to have just one version of the game available globally on Nintendo platforms. All the same, it's a curious situation that's resulted in a lot of discourse. But there's been another indie game that's been a source of even more chatter this week...New releasesHighguard is a 3v3 raid shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a team that includes a bunch of former Apex Legends and Titanfall developers. It broke cover at The Game Awards in December when it was the final reveal of the night but that first trailer wasn't great. As it turned out, TGA creator and host Geoff Keighley was a friend of the devs and after trying Highguard, he wanted to include it in the show. Wildlight cobbled together a trailer, but that disrupted the studio's long-standing plans to reveal and release the game simultaneously — a strategy that worked wonders for Apex Legends (though that game had the might of EA behind it).After revealing Highguard, Wildlight effectively went radio silent until a release day showcase on Monday to detail just what the game is and how it works. That seems to have been a mistake given the review bombing and strange vendetta some developed against it. Highguard went live on Monday and Wildlight published a whole bunch of YouTube videos revealing the game's features. Spreading those out between TGA and this week could have tempered expectations.In any case, I've played a few rounds of Highguard and mostly enjoyed my time with it so far. It's a blend of hero shooter and MOBA. As you might expect for a game from Apex and Titanfall veterans, the weapons feel well-tuned and the gunplay is snappy. There’s a lot going on and the maps are far too big for just six players. It's fun enough, but I don't think it's a game that's going to break my Overwatch obsession. Riding into battle on the back of a bear feels pretty great, though. You can play Highguard for free on Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.I really wanted to like Don’t Stop, Girlypop! more than I did. I'd been looking forward to it for a while, as the promise of a Doom Eternal-style arena shooter with chaotic hyperpop-inspired visuals seemed like a great blend. Don't get me wrong, I adore the aesthetic and the soundtrack is spot on thanks to some cracking songs from Sarah Wolfe, Xavier Dunn and Candice Susnjar. I just wish it was as fun to play as it is to look at and listen to.The visual clutter and fast pace sometimes makes it hard to spot enemies and the narrative doesn't really hang together, as much as the developers have salient points to make about the exploitation of finite resources. The core gameplay idea here is that the faster you move, the more damage you deal and more you heal. The game has its own take on a bunny hop called a wave hop that boosts your speed, but felt like it slowed me down because of the complex combination of inputs (jump, ground pound, jump, dash). That also caused my hand to cramp up very quickly. I do love the customization here. Slapping rhinestones and baby sharks onto my weapons was delightful. The game's take on a gravity gun is fun too. So while Don't Stop, Girlypop! — from Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee — didn't fully land for me, there are some aspects I like a whole lot. It's out now on Steam for $20 (there's a 10 percent launch discount until February 5).We're been looking forward to Cairn for a while around these parts, so it's heartening to see that it debuted to broadly positive reviews. This one from The Game Bakers is the latest in a string of climbing adventures, such as the lovely Jusant. So if Alex Honnold's recent free solo climb up a skyscraper has inspired you to ascend something very large without really posing a risk to your wellbeing, Cairn might be what you're looking for. Cairn is out now on PS5 and Steam for $30. There's a 10 percent launch discount on Steam until February 12, and until February 13 on PS5 if you're a PS Plus member.Every trailer I've seen for Steel Century Groove has made me smile, so you can bet I'll be jumping into this when I have a chance. It's a rhythm game with Pokémon-style RPG elements in which you take control of a robot in dance battles. There's some original and licensed music to boogie along to and you can load in your own MP3s (you can bank on me loading some Electric Callboy tracks into this game). Steel Century Groove will create procedurally-generated choreography and charts for your custom songs. You can manually adjust the BPM too.This debut title from solo developer Sloth Gloss Games is out now on Steam for $20. There's a 10 percent launch discount until February 11. There's a demo available, and progress from there carries over into the full game.Rosday's Wanderling is a roguelike platformer with no combat. You have eight attempts to acquire the gear and learn the knowledge you need to pass each dungeon. Scour for loot and buy upgrades from the shop before night falls to help you on your way. You can place markers to help you remember where you've been. Runs are said to be short at between 20 and 30 minutes. The visuals remind me a bit of Celeste too. You can check out Wanderling on Steam now for $8 (a 10 percent discount brings the price down to $7.20 until February 2).I can't help but admire Strange Scaffold (Clickolding, I Am Your Beast, Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking) and the rate at which it releases games. The latest one is Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator. It's a stock market sim in which you speculate on the future success or failures of the \"simulated lives of babies.\" You can \"short that baby\" if you choose as you try to make gains. In a timeline where prediction markets allow you to speculate on just about anything (listen to this week's episode of the Engadget Podcast to learn more about that), gambling on the future of babies doesn't seem that farfetched.Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator — which is set in the same world as Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator — is out now on Steam. It'll normally cost $20, but there's a 15 percent discount until February 12. Strange Scaffold is also bringing the game to Xbox Series X/S in the near future.I Hate This Place is an isometric survival game based on the eponymous comic book series by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin. The game retains a comic book aesthetic and it has '80s horror movie-style inflections. The way that noise is visualized is pretty interesting here. Onomatopoeic words will pop up and you'll see color-coded footsteps — useful when you're trying to be stealthy. Crafting is a key aspect of the game as well.I Hate This Place — from Rock Square Thunder, Broken Mirror Games and Skybound Entertainment — is out now on Steam, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S. The regular price is $30 and there's a 20 percent launch discount on some platforms. I can't find a trailer for this on YouTube, unfortunately, but Rebadge caught my eye this week as well. It's a puzzle platformer from Yuumayay, who appears to be a 17-year-old solo developer. Your character carries badges that allow them to carry out actions like moving and jumping. Other badges include \"affected by gravity\" and \"destroys on contact.\" Here's the trick: you can throw a badge and lose the associated ability, but then you can apply the trait to something else in the world.It's a neat idea that draws from the playbooks of games like Baba Is You. Rebadge typically costs $8, but there's a 15 percent launch discount.Upcoming Moon Beast Productions is a studio formed by several of the creators of Diablo and Diablo II. This week, it revealed gameplay for its first title, Darkhaven, which is a fantasy isometric action RPG in the vein of (you guessed it) Diablo. You'll be able to play this one solo or with friends, and there are PvP elements. Darkhaven has procedurally generated, destructible worlds along with \"massive events that threaten your entire world.\"The gameplay shown in the trailer looks a bit rough, but it's still early days. In fact, Moon Beast is planning a Kickstarter campaign for Darkhaven. There's no release window as yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam.Box or Void is a puzzle game that clearly takes some inspiration from Sokuban and Snake. Here, though, gameplay takes place across two planes. You'll switch between positive and negative space — obstacles on one side turn into pathways on the other. You'll alter the level layouts by pushing boxes. This one from Dumen Games has an intriguing premise. There's no release date as yet for Box or Void, but a demo with 32 levels (about a fifth of what will be in the full game) dropped this week on Steam.If there's a game that's billed as Dredge meets Wall-E, that's going to be enough to sell me. Describe it as a \"petroidvania\" and call it Good Boy, and I'm definitely in. This is a creature-collecting Metroidvania from Observer Interactive and publisher Team17 in which pups are reincarnated as space rovers. I could not dig that premise more. Good Boy is expected to hit Steam later this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/highguard-a-hyperpop-arena-shooter-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000874.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. There are tons of interesting games out this week. But first, there's been some discourse around the Nintendo Switch version of Dispatch, which arrived this week as well.On other platforms, there's an option to censor genitalia and other explicit content, but that's not present in the Switch version. Instead, such content is censored by default, with black rectangles covering up characters' bits and someone flipping the bird. Noises that suggest sexual pleasure are said to be toned down too.\"We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release,\" developer AdHoc told EuroGamer. Nintendo later said in a statement to GoNintendo that it \"requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations.\" There are other games available for the Switch and Switch 2 that feature nudity and explicit content. There have long been hentai games on the eShop, while mainstream games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 (we know all about the dongs in that one) still include explicit content on Nintendo platforms. So it's a bit of a strange one, and AdHoc and Nintendo didn't exactly clear things up with their statements. There's been speculation that AdHoc censored the game to comply with rules in Japan (Cyberpunk 2077 is censored there too) and that it opted to have just one version of the game available globally on Nintendo platforms. All the same, it's a curious situation that's resulted in a lot of discourse. But there's been another indie game that's been a source of even more chatter this week...New releasesHighguard is a 3v3 raid shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a team that includes a bunch of former Apex Legends and Titanfall developers. It broke cover at The Game Awards in December when it was the final reveal of the night but that first trailer wasn't great. As it turned out, TGA creator and host Geoff Keighley was a friend of the devs and after trying Highguard, he wanted to include it in the show. Wildlight cobbled together a trailer, but that disrupted the studio's long-standing plans to reveal and release the game simultaneously — a strategy that worked wonders for Apex Legends (though that game had the might of EA behind it).After revealing Highguard, Wildlight effectively went radio silent until a release day showcase on Monday to detail just what the game is and how it works. That seems to have been a mistake given the review bombing and strange vendetta some developed against it. Highguard went live on Monday and Wildlight published a whole bunch of YouTube videos revealing the game's features. Spreading those out between TGA and this week could have tempered expectations.In any case, I've played a few rounds of Highguard and mostly enjoyed my time with it so far. It's a blend of hero shooter and MOBA. As you might expect for a game from Apex and Titanfall veterans, the weapons feel well-tuned and the gunplay is snappy. There’s a lot going on and the maps are far too big for just six players. It's fun enough, but I don't think it's a game that's going to break my Overwatch obsession. Riding into battle on the back of a bear feels pretty great, though. You can play Highguard for free on Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.I really wanted to like Don’t Stop, Girlypop! more than I did. I'd been looking forward to it for a while, as the promise of a Doom Eternal-style arena shooter with chaotic hyperpop-inspired visuals seemed like a great blend. Don't get me wrong, I adore the aesthetic and the soundtrack is spot on thanks to some cracking songs from Sarah Wolfe, Xavier Dunn and Candice Susnjar. I just wish it was as fun to play as it is to look at and listen to.The visual clutter and fast pace sometimes makes it hard to spot enemies and the narrative doesn't really hang together, as much as the developers have salient points to make about the exploitation of finite resources. The core gameplay idea here is that the faster you move, the more damage you deal and more you heal. The game has its own take on a bunny hop called a wave hop that boosts your speed, but felt like it slowed me down because of the complex combination of inputs (jump, ground pound, jump, dash). That also caused my hand to cramp up very quickly. I do love the customization here. Slapping rhinestones and baby sharks onto my weapons was delightful. The game's take on a gravity gun is fun too. So while Don't Stop, Girlypop! — from Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee — didn't fully land for me, there are some aspects I like a whole lot.

While the FCC is unlikely to approve a network that expansive, SpaceX's strategy has been to request approval for unrealistically large numbers of satellites as a starting point for negotiations. The filing proposes establishing a network of solar-powered data centers in low Earth orbit that communicate with one another via lasers.

          "content": "When a new presidential administration comes in, it is responsible for filling around 4,000 jobs sprinkled across the federal government’s vast bureaucracy. These political appointees help carry out the president’s agenda, and, at least in theory, make government agencies responsive to elected officials. Some of these roles—the secretary of state, for example—are well-known. Others, such as the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals & metals industry & analysis, are more obscure. Historically, science agencies like NASA or the National Institutes of Health tend to have fewer political appointees than many other parts of the federal government. Sometimes, very senior roles—with authority over billions of dollars of spending, and the power to shape entire fields of research—are filled without any direct input from the White House or Congress. The arrangement reflects a long-running argument that scientists should oversee the work of funding and conducting research with very little interference from political leaders.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Exterminators keep getting calls for a reason. Wood-devouring insects, such as beetles, termites, and carpenter ants, are constantly chewing through walls or infecting trees and breaking them down. The fight against these insects usually involved noxious insecticides; but now, at least some of them can be eliminated using a certain species of fungus. Infestations of bark beetles are the bane of spruce trees. Eurasian spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) ingest bark high in phenolic compounds, organic molecules that often act as antioxidants and antimicrobials. They protect spruce bark from pathogenic fungi—and the beetles take advantage. Their bodies boost the antimicrobial power of these compounds by turning them into substances that are even more toxic to fungi. This would seem to make the beetles invulnerable to fungi. There is a way to get past the beetles’ borrowed defenses, though. Led by biochemist Ruo Sun, a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, found that some strains of the fungus Beauveria bassiana are capable of infecting and killing the pests.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "About a decade ago, many media outlets—including WIRED—zeroed in on a weird trend at the intersection of mental health, drug science, and Silicon Valley biohacking: microdosing, or the practice of taking a small amount of a psychedelic drug seeking not full-blown hallucinatory revels but gentler, more stable effects. Typically using psilocybin mushrooms or LSD, the archetypal microdoser sought less melting walls and open-eye kaleidoscopic visuals than boosts in mood and energy, like a gentle spring breeze blowing through the mind. Anecdotal reports pitched microdosing as a kind of psychedelic Swiss Army knife, providing everything from increased focus to a spiked libido and (perhaps most promisingly) lowered reported levels of depression. It was a miracle for many. Others remained wary. Could 5 percent of a dose of acid really do all that? A new, wide-ranging study by an Australian biopharma company suggests that microdosing’s benefits may indeed be drastically overstated—at least when it comes to addressing symptoms of clinical depression. A Phase 2B trial of 89 adult patients conducted by Melbourne-based MindBio Therapeutics, investigating the effects of microdosing LSD in the treatment of major depressive disorder, found that the psychedelic was actually outperformed by a placebo. Across an eight-week period, symptoms were gauged using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a widely recognized tool for the clinical evaluation of depression.Read full article Comments",
