          "standfirst": "Mark Zuckerberg says there's an end in sight to Reality Labs' years of multibillion-dollar losses following the company's layoffs to the metaverse division earlier this year. The CEO said he expects to \"gradually reduce\" how much money the company is losing as it doubles down on AI glasses and shifts away from virtual reality.Speaking during Meta's fourth-quarter earnings call, Zuckerberg was clear that the changes won't happen soon, but sounded optimistic about the division that lost more than $19 billion in 2025 alone. \"For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,\" he said. \"I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.\"The company cut more than 1,000 employees from Reality Labs earlier this month, shut down three VR studios and announced plans to retire its app for VR meetings. Meta has also paused plans for third-party Horizon OS headsets. Instead, Meta is doubling down on its smart glasses and and wearables business, which tie in more neatly to Zuckerberg's vision for creating AI \"superintelligence.\" During the call, Zuckerberg noted that sales of Meta's smart glasses \"more than tripled\" in 2025, and hinted at bigger plans for AR glasses. \"They [AI glasses] are going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you and help you as you go about your day and even show you information or generate custom UI right there in your vision,\" he said. Zuckerberg has spent the last few years laying the groundwork for pivoting Meta's metaverse work into AI. He offered one example if what the means for Meta’s Horizon app. \"You can imagine … people being able to easily, through a prompt, create a world or create a game, and be able to share that with people who they care about. And you see it in your feed, and you can jump right into it, and you can engage in it. And there are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that. And Horizon, I think fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that. “But there's definitely a version of the future where, you know, any video that you see, you can, like, tap on and jump into it and, like, engage and kind of like, experience it in a more meaningful way. And I think that the investments that we've done in both a lot of the virtual reality software and Horizon … are actually going to pair well with these AI advances to be able to bring some of those experiences to hundreds of millions and billions of people through mobile.\"One thing Zuckerberg didn’t mention, though: the word “metaverse.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html?src=rss",

When the issue first surfaced, TechCrunch described it as stemming from how paid content was accessed (only some creators offered content that could be consumed in-app). On Wednesday, a Patreon representative described the gray area as being “because Apple’s In-App Purchase system doesn’t support some of Patreon’s longstanding billing models.”But now Apple has reimposed its subscription mandate, eliminating the gray area. \"We know that Apple is serious about enforcing this mandate,\" Patreon wrote. \"Late last year, they blocked a Patreon app update and made it clear that in order to remain in the App Store, we have to comply with their billing requirement. Because millions of fans use iOS as their primary way to access Patreon and connect with creators, having our app blocked — or not available in the App Store at all — isn't an option.\"Patreon’s \"whiplash\" description isn't hyperbole. Apple first announced the mandate in 2024. At that time, the deadline for all Patreon creators to make the switch was set to November 2025 — one that Patreon grudgingly accepted. But according to the company, Apple told it last May that the original 2025 deadline was no longer in effect. Now, it appears to have reversed that again.If there's a silver lining, TechCrunch notes that only 4 percent of Patreon creators are using the affected (legacy) billing models.

          "standfirst": "Following its recent AI makeover of Gmail, Google is bringing more Gemini-powered tools to Chrome. Starting today, a host of new features are rolling out for the browser, with more to come over the next few months. The first of the new features is a sidebar. Available to all Gemini in Chrome users, the interface allows you to chat with Gemini and keep a conversation going across multiple tabs. Google suggests the sidebar is useful for multitaskers. \"Our testers have been using it for all sorts of things: comparing options across too-many-tabs, summarizing product reviews across different sites, and helping find time for events in even the most chaotic of calendars,\" the company writes. Now you can access Nano Banana, Google's in-house image generator, directly from Chrome. No need to go to the Gemini app.GoogleThe sidebar is also where you access the second new feature Google is adding to Chrome. Following its successful rollout within the Gemini app, Nano Banana, Google's in-house image generator, is available directly inside of the browser. With the addition, you won't need to open a new tab when you want Gemini to make you an AI image. You also won't need to download and upload a file when you want Gemini to edit an existing image for you. Instead, you can complete both of those tasks from any of your open tabs, thanks to the new sidebar. Looking forward, Google plans to bring Personal Intelligence, which debuted inside of the Gemini app at the start of January, to Chrome in the coming months. Once the feature arrives, it will allow the browser to remember past conversations you've had with Gemini. In turn, Google says this will lead to a more personalized Chrome. \"Personal Intelligence in Chrome transforms the browsing experience from a general purpose tool into a trusted partner that understands you and provides relevant, proactive, and context-aware assistance,\" the company said. In the meantime, Gemini in Chrome already supports Google's Connected Apps feature, which allows the assistant to pull information from the company's other services, including Gmail and Calendar. During a press briefing, a Google employee demoed this feature by asking Gemini to pull up the dates of when their children would be on March break. Without telling the assistant where to look, Gemini sourced the correct time frame from the employee's email inbox. A new sidebar interface allows Chrome users to access Gemini from any of their open tabs.GoogleLast but not least, Google is previewing a new auto browse feature inside of Chrome. In the demo the company showed, an employee asked Gemini to find and buy them the same winter jacket they bought a few seasons ago. The assistant first drafted a plan outlining how best to tackle the request. It reasoned the best place to start was with a search of the employee's email inbox to determine the correct model and size of jacket. It then went shopping. While Gemini was working on this task, the employee was free to continue browsing in Chrome. At several points in the process, the assistant would stop before continuing to obtain the employee's permission to move forward. For instance, it paused when it needed login credentials, and again when it needed a credit card number to complete the purchase. Judging from the demo, it will probably take you less time to do your online shopping and other browser tasks on your own. Google suggests the feature will appeal to those who are creatures of habit. Say you often order the same produce from a grocery delivery service every week, Gemini can automate the ordering. Plus, the feature is in preview, so early testers probably won't be too put off by Gemini's slow pace. In any case, Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US can try auto browse starting today.

          "standfirst": "Tel Aviv-based startup Factify emerged from stealth today with a $73 million seed round for an ambitious, yet quixotic mission: to bring digital documents beyond the standard formats most businesses use — .PDF, .docx, collaborative cloud files like Google Docs — and into the intelligence era.For Matan Gavish, Factify’s Founder and CEO, this isn&#x27;t just a software upgrade—it is an inevitability he has been obsessed with for years.\"The PDF was developed when I was in elementary school,\" Gavish told VentureBeat. \"The bedrock of the software ecosystem hasn&#x27;t really evolved... someone has to redesign the digital document itself.\"Gavish, a tenured professor of computer science and Stanford PhD, admits that his fixation on administrative file formats is an anomaly for someone with his credentials. \"It&#x27;s a very uncool problem to be obsessed with,\" he says. \"Given the fact that my academic background is AI and machine learning, my mom wanted me to start an AI company because it&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m obsessed and then possessed by documents.\"But that obsession has now attracted a sizeable seed round led by Valley Capital Partners and backed by AI heavyweights like former Google AI chief John Giannandrea.The bet is simple the static rigidity of most digital files has limited their utility, and a better, more intelligent document that actually shares its edit history and ownership with users as intended, is not only possible — it&#x27;s a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. The history of digital documentsTo understand why a seed round would balloon to $73 million, you have to understand the scale of the trap businesses are in. There are currently an estimated three trillion PDFs in circulation. \"Some people see the PDF more than they see their kids,\" Gavish jokes.The history of the digital document is not a linear progression where one format replaces another. Instead, it is a story of \"speciation,\" where different formats evolved to fill distinct ecological niches: creation, distribution, and collaboration.The era of files: Microsoft Word (1980s–1990s)Digital documents began as isolated artifacts. In the 1980s, the \"document\" was inextricably linked to the hardware that created it. A file created in WordPerfect on a DOS machine was effectively gibberish to a Macintosh user.Microsoft Word, which traces its lineage to the pioneering WYSIWYG editors at Xerox PARC, changed this by leveraging the dominance of the Windows operating system. By the 1990s, the binary .doc format became the default container for editable professional documents. However, these files were structurally complex \"memory dumps\" designed for the limited hardware of the time, often leading to corruption or privacy leaks where deleted text remained hidden in the file&#x27;s binary data.The era of digital &#x27;stone&#x27;: the PDF (1990s-2006)The PDF did not originate as a tool for writing; it was a tool for viewing. In 1991, Adobe co-founder John Warnock penned the \"Camelot Project\" white paper, envisioning a \"digital envelope\" that would look identical on any display or printer.Unlike Word files, which were malleable, PDFs were designed to be immutable. They used the PostScript imaging model to place characters at precise coordinates, ensuring visual fidelity. While adoption was initially slow, Adobe’s 1994 decision to release the Acrobat Reader for free established PDF as the global standard for \"digital concrete\"—the format of finality used for contracts, government forms, and archives.The collaborative cloud docs era (2006-present)In 2006, Google disrupted the model again by moving the document from the hard drive to the browser. Using \"Operational Transformation\" algorithms, Google Docs allowed multiple users to edit the same stream of text simultaneously.This shifted the paradigm from \"sending a file\" to \"sharing a link.\" While Google Workspace now claims over 3 billion users (mostly consumers and education), it fundamentally changed how we work—turning documents into living, collaborative processes rather than static artifacts.The status quo: fragmentationDespite these advances, the business world remains fragmented. We draft in Google Docs (the \"Digital Stream\"), format in Word (the \"Digital Clay\"), and sign in PDF (the \"Digital Stone\").But this fragmentation has a cost. \"The problem is not the document. It is everything around it,\" the company notes. \"Once a PDF leaves your system, control is gone. Versions drift. Access is unclear. Nothing is visible.\"Turning digital documents into intelligent infrastructureFactify’s wager is that in the age of AI, this fragmentation is no longer just annoying—it is a critical failure. AI models need structured, verifiable data to function. When an AI \"reads\" a PDF, it is essentially guessing, using optical character recognition to scrape text from what is effectively a digital photo.\"What we&#x27;re dealing with here is a megalomaniac vision, but it&#x27;s at the same time probably something that is inevitable,\" Gavish says.Factify’s solution is to treat documents not as static files, but as intelligent infrastructure. In the \"Factified\" standard, a document carries its own brain. It possesses a unique identity, a live permission system, and an immutable audit log that travels with it.\"We wrote a new document format that supplants the PostScript,\" Gavish explains. \"We created a new data layer that supports the document as a first class citizen... and it&#x27;s always available inside the organization and potentially outside.\"This distinction—between a File and an API—is the core of the company&#x27;s pitch\"Files are liabilities: They accumulate, get lost, and can be stolen. \"It goes back to a brick status,\" Gavish says. \"Files are liabilities, if anything, because they just accumulate there, you have to guard them.\"APIs are assets: A Factify document is an active object. You can ask it questions: \"Who has seen you? When do you expire? Are you the most up-to-date version?\"&#x27;People don&#x27;t change&#x27;, but formats doHistory is littered with formats that tried to replace the PDF (like Microsoft’s XPS). They failed because they demanded too much behavioral change from users. Gavish is keenly aware of this trap.\"When I talk to enterprise software entrepreneurs, I tell them the two laws to know about starting a company in enterprise software is that people don&#x27;t care, and no one changes,\" he says.To skirt this, Factify has built deep backwards compatibility. A Factified document can look exactly like a PDF, complete with page breaks and margins. Users don&#x27;t need to learn a new interface to get value; they just need to solve a specific pain point—like an executive who wants to ensure an investment memo can’t be forwarded.\"All they have to tell their team is, &#x27;Dear Chief of Staff, employment agreements and investment memoranda... are going to be Factified. The rest carry on,&#x27;\" Gavish says. \"They see immediate benefit... but then they discover that they&#x27;ve crossed the Rubicon.\"What&#x27;s next for Factify?The capital from this round will be used to deepen the platform&#x27;s core engineering—which Gavish describes as a \"heavy engineering lift\" requiring them to rebuild the document format, data layer, and application layer from scratch. The company is also establishing a major operational hub in Pittsburgh to support its U.S. expansion.Ultimately, Factify isn&#x27;t trying to build another collaboration tool like Google Docs. They are trying to build the immutable record of the future—the standard for \"truth\" in a digital world.\"The PDF... became a standard meaning I cannot file my taxes using any other format.

I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m obsessed and then possessed by documents.\"But that obsession has now attracted a sizeable seed round led by Valley Capital Partners and backed by AI heavyweights like former Google AI chief John Giannandrea.The bet is simple the static rigidity of most digital files has limited their utility, and a better, more intelligent document that actually shares its edit history and ownership with users as intended, is not only possible — it&#x27;s a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. The history of digital documentsTo understand why a seed round would balloon to $73 million, you have to understand the scale of the trap businesses are in. There are currently an estimated three trillion PDFs in circulation. \"Some people see the PDF more than they see their kids,\" Gavish jokes.The history of the digital document is not a linear progression where one format replaces another. Instead, it is a story of \"speciation,\" where different formats evolved to fill distinct ecological niches: creation, distribution, and collaboration.The era of files: Microsoft Word (1980s–1990s)Digital documents began as isolated artifacts. In the 1980s, the \"document\" was inextricably linked to the hardware that created it. A file created in WordPerfect on a DOS machine was effectively gibberish to a Macintosh user.Microsoft Word, which traces its lineage to the pioneering WYSIWYG editors at Xerox PARC, changed this by leveraging the dominance of the Windows operating system. By the 1990s, the binary .doc format became the default container for editable professional documents. However, these files were structurally complex \"memory dumps\" designed for the limited hardware of the time, often leading to corruption or privacy leaks where deleted text remained hidden in the file&#x27;s binary data.The era of digital &#x27;stone&#x27;: the PDF (1990s-2006)The PDF did not originate as a tool for writing; it was a tool for viewing. In 1991, Adobe co-founder John Warnock penned the \"Camelot Project\" white paper, envisioning a \"digital envelope\" that would look identical on any display or printer.Unlike Word files, which were malleable, PDFs were designed to be immutable. They used the PostScript imaging model to place characters at precise coordinates, ensuring visual fidelity. While adoption was initially slow, Adobe’s 1994 decision to release the Acrobat Reader for free established PDF as the global standard for \"digital concrete\"—the format of finality used for contracts, government forms, and archives.The collaborative cloud docs era (2006-present)In 2006, Google disrupted the model again by moving the document from the hard drive to the browser. Using \"Operational Transformation\" algorithms, Google Docs allowed multiple users to edit the same stream of text simultaneously.This shifted the paradigm from \"sending a file\" to \"sharing a link.\" While Google Workspace now claims over 3 billion users (mostly consumers and education), it fundamentally changed how we work—turning documents into living, collaborative processes rather than static artifacts.The status quo: fragmentationDespite these advances, the business world remains fragmented. We draft in Google Docs (the \"Digital Stream\"), format in Word (the \"Digital Clay\"), and sign in PDF (the \"Digital Stone\").But this fragmentation has a cost. \"The problem is not the document. It is everything around it,\" the company notes. \"Once a PDF leaves your system, control is gone. Versions drift. Access is unclear. Nothing is visible.\"Turning digital documents into intelligent infrastructureFactify’s wager is that in the age of AI, this fragmentation is no longer just annoying—it is a critical failure. AI models need structured, verifiable data to function. When an AI \"reads\" a PDF, it is essentially guessing, using optical character recognition to scrape text from what is effectively a digital photo.\"What we&#x27;re dealing with here is a megalomaniac vision, but it&#x27;s at the same time probably something that is inevitable,\" Gavish says.Factify’s solution is to treat documents not as static files, but as intelligent infrastructure. In the \"Factified\" standard, a document carries its own brain. It possesses a unique identity, a live permission system, and an immutable audit log that travels with it.\"We wrote a new document format that supplants the PostScript,\" Gavish explains. \"We created a new data layer that supports the document as a first class citizen... and it&#x27;s always available inside the organization and potentially outside.\"This distinction—between a File and an API—is the core of the company&#x27;s pitch\"Files are liabilities: They accumulate, get lost, and can be stolen. \"It goes back to a brick status,\" Gavish says. \"Files are liabilities, if anything, because they just accumulate there, you have to guard them.\"APIs are assets: A Factify document is an active object. You can ask it questions: \"Who has seen you? When do you expire? Are you the most up-to-date version?\"&#x27;People don&#x27;t change&#x27;, but formats doHistory is littered with formats that tried to replace the PDF (like Microsoft’s XPS). They failed because they demanded too much behavioral change from users. Gavish is keenly aware of this trap.\"When I talk to enterprise software entrepreneurs, I tell them the two laws to know about starting a company in enterprise software is that people don&#x27;t care, and no one changes,\" he says.To skirt this, Factify has built deep backwards compatibility. A Factified document can look exactly like a PDF, complete with page breaks and margins. Users don&#x27;t need to learn a new interface to get value; they just need to solve a specific pain point—like an executive who wants to ensure an investment memo can’t be forwarded.\"All they have to tell their team is, &#x27;Dear Chief of Staff, employment agreements and investment memoranda... are going to be Factified. The rest carry on,&#x27;\" Gavish says. \"They see immediate benefit... but then they discover that they&#x27;ve crossed the Rubicon.\"What&#x27;s next for Factify?The capital from this round will be used to deepen the platform&#x27;s core engineering—which Gavish describes as a \"heavy engineering lift\" requiring them to rebuild the document format, data layer, and application layer from scratch. The company is also establishing a major operational hub in Pittsburgh to support its U.S. expansion.Ultimately, Factify isn&#x27;t trying to build another collaboration tool like Google Docs. They are trying to build the immutable record of the future—the standard for \"truth\" in a digital world.\"The PDF... became a standard meaning I cannot file my taxes using any other format. This is how victory looks like,\" Gavish says. \"We are creating a document standard that is not specific for health care or for insurance, but is just document as such.\"For the three trillion static files currently sitting in cloud storage, the writing may finally be on the wall.",

          "standfirst": "As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood. I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong. If you're interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of the best free VPNs — and if you're willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the best VPN deals updated weekly. For each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs. Editor's note: This list is up-to-date as of January 2026.

Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We've just published a full Windscribe review that can tell you more. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",
          "content": "As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood. I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong. If you're interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of the best free VPNs — and if you're willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the best VPN deals updated weekly. For each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs. Editor's note: This list is up-to-date as of January 2026. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors. Table of contents Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested What to look for in a VPN VPN FAQs Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We've just published a full Windscribe review that can tell you more. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works.

You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.

          "standfirst": "If one of your New Year's resolutions was to improve your cybersecurity, it's not too late. Most of the holiday deals are over by now, but plenty of services are still offering excellent prices. With access to a virtual private network (VPN), you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and any advertisers it may sell that data to — all while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from all across the globe. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but if you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to mistakenly end up paying more than you want to, as otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even with all those caveats, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $78.18 for a two-year subscription with four months free (78 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $100.58 for a two-year subscription with four months free (74 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan. NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Windscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap). Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to Monarch Money, one of Engadget's favorite budgeting apps, for just $50 if you use code NEWYEAR2026 at checkout and you're a new subscriber. That's a 50 percent discount on the service's normal $100 price. Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you're tracking that month. How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you've labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together. The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app's learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch's web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you're trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.

          "standfirst": "Services have been a huge part of Apple’s business for the past several years — to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in revenue last year alone. Now, with the new Apple Creator Studio bundle, the company is leaning harder into the professional creative software space. Apple Creator Studio packages a bunch of the company’s pro apps into a single subscription service that you can pay monthly or yearly for. It’s officially available starting January 28, and includes a one-month free trial. The key shift is that some of these apps are now subscription-only on iPad, even as Apple continues to offer one-time purchases on the Mac – albeit with slightly different feature offerings. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple Creator Studio and the programs it includes. What Apple Creator Studio includes At its core, Apple Creator Studio gives subscribers access to Apple’s professional video, music and imaging apps. The bundle includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage. Pixelmator Pro (which Apple acquired in late 2024) is also coming to iPad for the first time, with a touch-optimized interface and Apple Pencil support. A Creator Studio subscription also unlocks premium content and features inside Apple’s productivity apps. Keynote, Pages and Numbers remain free, but subscribers get access to premium templates and themes, plus a new Content Hub with Apple-curated photos, graphics and illustrations. Similar paid features are coming to Freeform later this year, the company says. Apple is also using the bundle to introduce new “intelligence” features across several apps. In Final Cut Pro, the new Beat Detection feature can analyze a music track and show a beat grid so you can line edits up to the rhythm. The app is also getting tools like transcript search and visual search designed to make it easier to find moments across footage. Logic Pro is gaining new AI-assisted Session Players and workflow features on Mac and iPad. Pixelmator Pro continues to rely heavily on machine learning for tasks like background removal, image repair and image upscaling. Note that some of these features require an Apple Intelligence-capable device. Which devices are supported Apple Creator Studio works across multiple Apple platforms, though not every app is available everywhere. On the Mac, subscribers get access to all six apps: Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage. On the iPad, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro are included. Motion, Compressor and MainStage remain Mac-only. On the iPhone, Creator Studio does not include full versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro or Pixelmator Pro. Instead, it unlocks premium features and content inside Keynote, Pages and Numbers, and eventually Freeform. Apple says the best experience is on macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and iOS 26 or later, with individual app requirements varying by device and chip. Apple Creator Studio apps Apple Pricing and subscription options Apple Creator Studio costs $12.99 per month or $129 per year, and new subscribers can try the service free for one month. College students and educators get a steep discount: the education plan costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and it also comes with a one-month free trial. A standard subscription can be shared with up to five other people using Family Sharing, allowing six users total. Education subscriptions are limited to individual use and cannot be shared. Apple is also offering three free months of Creator Studio to customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or iPad around launch. But Creator Studio isn’t the only way you can access most of these apps. Apple says all of the major apps included in Creator Studio will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store. Final Cut Pro remains priced at $299.99, Logic Pro at $199.99, Pixelmator Pro at $49.99, Motion at $49.99, Compressor at $49.99 and MainStage at $29.99. Users who already own these apps can keep using them and re-download them from the App Store as usual. On the iPad, however, things are different. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro for iPad are only available through the Creator Studio subscription. There is no standalone purchase option for those apps on iPadOS. Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform remain free for everyone to download and use. Apple says those apps will continue receiving updates, including the upcoming visual design changes tied to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. Without a Creator Studio subscription, you can still create, edit and collaborate in those apps. What you will not get are the paid templates, Content Hub assets and certain intelligence features. What happens to your projects if you cancel Apple says projects and content you create with an active subscription remain licensed as part of your original work. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro projects remain on your devices and can be copied or shared elsewhere. But you will need an active subscription to open or edit projects in those paid apps. Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform documents remain editable without a subscription. However, you will not be able to make new edits that rely on paid features once your subscription ends. Other information about the Apple Creator Studio app bundle Apple Creator Studio also comes with some immediate trade-offs. Alongside the bundle, Apple confirmed that the older Pixelmator app for iPhone and iPad, now described as Pixelmator Classic, will no longer receive updates. Apple says it will remain functional, but development is shifting to Pixelmator Pro, including the new iPad version included with Creator Studio. But don't expect the standalone versions of the apps to maintain feature parity with their Creator Studio counterparts. Per Apple's FAQ, \"The Apple Creator Studio version of Pixelmator Pro includes access to the Warp Tool feature,\" which implies that feature isn't present on the standalone version. More broadly, the bundle puts Apple more directly in competition with Adobe and other subscription-focused creative platforms, especially for people who are looking for a lower monthly entry point. At the same time, Apple is keeping one-time purchases on the table for Mac users, even as iPad access moves behind a subscription. Apple Creator Studio will be available January 28. Whether it makes sense will likely come down to which device you work on and whether you would otherwise pay upfront for one or more of Apple’s pro apps.

          "standfirst": "The generative AI era has sped everything up for most enterprises we talk to, especially development cycles (thanks to \"vibe coding\" and \"agentic swarming\").But even as they seek to leverage the power of new AI-assisted programming tools and coding agents like Claude Code to generate code, enterprises must contend with a looming concern — no, not safety (although that&#x27;s another one!): cloud spend. According to Gartner, public cloud spend will rise 21.3% in 2026 and yet, according to Flexera&#x27;s last State of the Cloud report, up to 32% of enterprise cloud spend is actually just wasted resources — duplicated code, non-functional code, outdated code, needless scaffolding, inefficient processes, etc.Today, a new firm, Adaptive6 emerged from stealth to reduce this cloud waste in realtime — automatically. The company, which also announced $44 million in total funding including a $28 million Series A led by U.S. Venture Partners (USVP), aims to treat cloud waste not as a financial discrepancy, but as a code vulnerability that must be detected and patched.Co-founded by CEO Aviv Revach, an experienced founder, former Head of Strategy at Taboola, and a former security research team leader for the Israeli Military Intelligence Unit 8200, the idea behind the venture came directly from his experience working in cybersecurity.“We realized this is not a financial problem; it’s an engineering problem,\" Revach told VentureBeat in an exclusive video call interview conducted recently. \"We drew on our background in cybersecurity, where to find vulnerabilities, you scan the cloud, identify the issues, map them back to the relevant code, find the responsible developer or engineer, and remediate—or, in some cases, shift left and prevent them altogether... it was obvious that this is exactly what we need to do.”Adaptive6’s platform introduces a radical shift in how enterprises govern infrastructure: instead of asking finance teams to spot inefficiencies they can’t fix, it empowers engineers to resolve waste directly in their workflow. By applying the rigor of cybersecurity—scanning, tracing, and remediation—Adaptive6 automates the cleanup of \"Shadow Waste\" across complex multi-cloud environments.The shift: from billing to engineeringFor years, the industry standard for managing cloud costs has been \"visibility\"—dashboards that tell you yesterday’s news. Revach argues that visibility without action is just noise.\"The first generation of tools are sort of trying to help on the financial side of the cloud,\" Revach told VentureBeat. \"They typically deal with the financial aspects of cloud cost... showing you costs going up, costs going down, forecasting, budgeting. But what they don&#x27;t really focus on is one of the biggest problems, which is the waste problem.\" According to Revach, the disconnect lies in ownership.\"Just like you have the CISO in cybersecurity trying to get everybody to be thinking about security, you now have the FinOps person trying to get everybody to be thinking about cloud cost.\" Technology: hunting \"shadow waste\"The core of Adaptive6’s offering is its \"Cloud Cost Governance and Optimization\" (CCGO) platform. It doesn&#x27;t just look for idle servers; it hunts for what the company calls Shadow Waste—hidden inefficiencies in architecture and application workloads that traditional cost tools often miss.The system operates without agents, using standard cloud APIs to gain read-only access to environments. Revach explained to VentureBeat that the platform scans across AWS, GCP, and Azure, as well as PaaS layers like Databricks and Snowflake, and even deep into Kubernetes clusters. \"We have unique technology that basically allows us to match each resource in the cloud [where] we found a problem to the relevant line of code that actually created that problem,\" Revach explained. This \"Cloud to Code\" technology allows the system to identify the specific engineer who made the change and serve them a fix directly in their workflow (Jira, Slack, or ServiceNow). Beyond basic resource sizing, the platform analyzes complex configurations, including those for emerging AI workloads. Revach highlighted a specific technical nuance regarding \"provisioned throughput\" for Large Language Models (LLMs) on AWS. He noted that engineers often struggle to balance commitment levels—committing too little risks performance, while committing too much wastes capital. Adaptive6’s engine analyzes these specific usage patterns to recommend the precise throughput commitment needed, a level of granularity that general finance tools lack. Revach also provided a specific example of \"Shadow Waste\" involving application-level inefficiencies:\"If you&#x27;re using Python... and you&#x27;re not using the latest version—right now, version 3.12 made a major change that made it far more efficient,\" he said. \"Most folks, when they think about cloud cost, they don&#x27;t necessarily think of the Python version, so they only think about the size of the machine. By moving to that version, you gain the efficiency so your code just runs faster, and you reduce the cost.\" The AI paradox: both problem and solutionWhile Adaptive6 uses AI to generate remediation scripts and \"1-Click Fixes,\" Revach was careful to distinguish their deep-tech approach from generic AI coding agents. In fact, he noted that AI-generated code is often a source of waste itself.\"The code that is produced by AI is many times not that efficient because it was trained on a lot of code that other people wrote that didn&#x27;t necessarily take cloud cost optimization and governance into account,\" Revach warned.This is why Adaptive6 relies on a research team of experts rather than just generative models to identify inefficiencies. \"Just like with vulnerability research, you see cyber companies getting the best of the best security researchers to find things... we are doing the exact same thing for cost inefficiencies,\" Revach said. Impact and adoptionThe platform is already in use by major enterprises, including Ticketmaster, Bayer, and Norstella, with customers reporting 15–35% reductions in total cloud spend.For global organizations, the ability to decentralized cost management is critical. \"As complex as it gets with a big organization, that&#x27;s exactly our sweet spot,\" Revach noted. He cited one dramatic instance of the tool&#x27;s efficacy: \"We&#x27;ve had a case where one misconfiguration that basically an organization solved actually resulted in more than a million dollars of savings.\"Looking aheadThe system also includes \"shift left\" prevention capabilities, integrating directly into CI/CD pipelines. This allows the platform to scan code for cost inefficiencies before it ever goes live, effectively blocking expensive architectural mistakes before they are deployed—much like a security scanner blocks vulnerable code. \"We detect what&#x27;s already wasting money, prevent new inefficiencies before they deploy, and remediate at scale,\" Revach said. By shifting the responsibility left to developers, Adaptive6 suggests the future of cloud cost management won&#x27;t be found in a spreadsheet, but in a pull request.",

Impact and adoptionThe platform is already in use by major enterprises, including Ticketmaster, Bayer, and Norstella, with customers reporting 15–35% reductions in total cloud spend.For global organizations, the ability to decentralized cost management is critical. \"As complex as it gets with a big organization, that&#x27;s exactly our sweet spot,\" Revach noted. He cited one dramatic instance of the tool&#x27;s efficacy: \"We&#x27;ve had a case where one misconfiguration that basically an organization solved actually resulted in more than a million dollars of savings.\"Looking aheadThe system also includes \"shift left\" prevention capabilities, integrating directly into CI/CD pipelines. This allows the platform to scan code for cost inefficiencies before it ever goes live, effectively blocking expensive architectural mistakes before they are deployed—much like a security scanner blocks vulnerable code. \"We detect what&#x27;s already wasting money, prevent new inefficiencies before they deploy, and remediate at scale,\" Revach said. By shifting the responsibility left to developers, Adaptive6 suggests the future of cloud cost management won&#x27;t be found in a spreadsheet, but in a pull request.",

          "standfirst": "Tax season is fast approaching, and unfortunately for 2026, Direct File isn't an option anymore. The free, government-provided service was shut down, so you'll need to look to other federal programs, including IRS Free File, to file your paperwork. If you don't qualify for Free File, TurboTax might be your best bet for a relatively cheap, efficient way to file your taxes. While it pains us to suggest you give money to a company that has spent decades lobbying to ensure America's tax system remains a nightmare, we can at least help you save a bit of cash if you've determined TurboTax is a necessary expense for you this year. Right now, Amazon has discounted the deluxe desktop edition of TurboTax by 44 percent. That gets you $35 off software that normally costs $80, which you can use to file both your individual state and federal taxes. For most Americans, that should cover their needs. However, if you're self-employed, you'll need to pony up for the more expensive Business version of TurboTax, which is currently 42 percent off, or $54 off. One last thing to note: you'll need a PC with either Windows 11 or macOS Sonoma to run the software, so an older machine won't do, unfortunately. An alternative that's also on sale is from H&R Block. Amazon has H&R Block's Deluxe + State tax software for 50 percent off, bringing it down to only $30. It works on Windows and Mac devices and lets you import your previous year's personal tax return, even from competing software like TurboTax and Quicken.

It&#x27;s a standalone research agent that deploys teams of specialized AI agents working in parallel to complete research tasks.The technical innovation lies in how Superagent&#x27;s orchestrator maintains context. Earlier agent systems used simple model routing where an intermediary filtered information between models. Airtable&#x27;s orchestrator maintains full visibility over the entire execution journey: the initial plan, execution steps and sub-agent results. This creates what co-founder Howie Liu calls \"a coherent journey\" where the orchestrator made all decisions along the way. \"It ultimately comes down to how you leverage the model&#x27;s self-reflective capability,\" Liu told VentureBeat. Liu co-founded Airtable more than a dozen years ago with a cloud-based relational database at its core.Airtable built its business on a singular bet: Software should adapt to how people work, not the other way around. That philosophy powered growth to over 500,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, using its platform to build custom applications fitted to their workflows.The Superagent technology is an evolution of capabilities originally developed by DeepSky (formerly known as Gradient), which Airtable acquired in October 2025.From structured data to free-form agentsLiu frames Airtable and Superagent as complementary form factors that together address different enterprise needs. Airtable provides the structured foundation, and Superagent handles unstructured research tasks.\"We obviously started with a data layer. It&#x27;s in the name Airtable: It&#x27;s a table of data,\" Liu said.The platform evolved as scaffolding around that core database with workflow capabilities, automations, and interfaces that scale to thousands of users. \"I think Superagent is a very complementary form factor, which is very unstructured,\" Liu said. \"These agents are, by nature, very free form.\"The decision to build free-form capabilities reflects industry learnings about using increasingly capable models. Liu said that as the models have gotten smarter, the best way to use them is to have fewer restrictions on how they run.How Superagent&#x27;s multi-agent system worksWhen a user submits a query, the orchestrator creates a visible plan that breaks complex research into parallel workstreams. So, for example if you&#x27;re researching a company for investment, it&#x27;ll break that up into different parts of that task, like research the team, research the funding history, research the competitive landscape. Each workstream gets delegated to a specialized agent that executes independently. These agents work in parallel, their work coordinated by the system, each contributing its piece to the whole.While Airtable describes Superagent as a multi-agent system, it relies on a central orchestrator that plans, dispatches, and monitors subtasks — a more controlled model than fully autonomous agents.Airtable&#x27;s orchestrator maintains full visibility over the entire execution journey: the initial plan, execution steps and sub-agent results. This creates what Liu calls \"a coherent journey\" where the orchestrator made all decisions along the way. The sub-agent approach aggregates cleaned results without polluting the main orchestrator&#x27;s context. Superagent uses multiple frontier models for different sub-tasks, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.This solves two problems: It manages context windows by aggregating cleaned results without pollution, and it enables adaptation during execution.\"Maybe it tried doing a research task in a certain way that didn&#x27;t work out, couldn&#x27;t find the right information, and then it decided to try something else,\" Liu said. \"It knows that it tried the first thing and it didn&#x27;t work. So it won&#x27;t make the same mistake again.\"Why data semantics determine agent performanceFrom a builder perspective, Liu argues that agent performance depends more on data structure quality than model selection or prompt engineering. He based this on Airtable&#x27;s experience building an internal data analysis tool to figure out what works.The internal tool experiment revealed that data preparation consumed more effort than agent configuration.\"We found that the hardest part to get right was not actually the agent harness, but most of the special sauce had more to do with massaging the data semantics,\" Liu said. \"Agents really benefit from good data semantics.\"The data preparation work focused on three areas: restructuring data so agents could find the right tables and fields, clarifying what those fields represent, and ensuring agents could use them reliably in queries and analysis. What enterprises need to knowFor organizations evaluating multi-agent systems or building custom implementations, Liu&#x27;s experience points to several technical priorities.Data architecture precedes agent deployment. The internal experiment demonstrated that enterprises should expect data preparation to consume more resources than agent configuration. Organizations with unstructured data or poor schema documentation will struggle with agent reliability and accuracy regardless of model sophistication.Context management is critical. Simply stitching different LLMs together to create an agentic workflow isn&#x27;t enough. There needs to be a proper context orchestrator that can maintain state and information with a view of the whole workflow.Relational databases matter. Relational database architecture provides cleaner semantics for agent navigation than document stores or unstructured repositories. Organizations standardizing on NoSQL for performance reasons should consider maintaining relational views or schemas for agent consumption.Orchestration requires planning capabilities. Just like a relational database has a query planner to optimize results, agentic workflows need an orchestration layer that plans and manages outcomes.\"So the punchline and the short version is that a lot of it comes down to having a really good planning and execution orchestration layer for the agent, and being able to fully leverage the models for what they&#x27;re good at,\" Liu said.",

          "standfirst": "The peak time for deals on streaming services — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported Disney+ Hulu bundle for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately.

The aim is to “provide a fairer deal for content publishers, particularly news organizations,” the CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell said in a press release. With Google accounting for more than 90 percent of search inquiries in the UK, the CMA recently designated the company with “strategic market status” for search under the Digital Market Act. That allows the regulator to apply “conduct requirements” on Google to promote competition and avoid antitrust issues.With those new powers, the CMA proposed a number of measures today. The first is a set of controls that would allow publishers to opt out of their content being used for features like AI Overviews or to train AI models. Google would also need to properly attribute publisher content. Another measure would require Google to apply fair search result rankings for businesses, with an “effective process for raising and investigating issues.” Google would also need to provide a “choice screen” for alternative search options on Android mobile and Chrome browsers. “These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services — as well as unlocking greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy,” Cardell said in a statement.In response, Google wrote that it’s “exploring updates to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features.” The aim, it said, is to keep search helpful for people who want information quickly while allowing publishers to better manage content. “Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,” the company wrote, adding that it’s “optimistic” it can meet the CMA’s requirements.When its new designation was announced in October 2025, Google complained that some of the proposed interventions would inhibit UK innovation and growth. Citing a study, the company said that similar measures imposed by the European Union produced “negative results” that “have cost businesses $114 billion.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/uk-wants-to-give-web-publishers-a-fairer-deal-with-googles-ai-overviews-132742850.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Shokz OpenFit Pro review: Reducing distractions while keeping your ears open",
          "standfirst": "Rarely does a set of open-fit earbuds actually impress me. I tend to find them underwhelming because overall sound quality is subpar compared to the more “traditional” in-ear models. Any promise of noise reduction, or a far-fetched claim of noise cancellation, usually doesn’t hold true. The first time I used the Shokz OpenFit Pro ($249.95) I was immediately met with better audio performance than I’d just experienced on Sony’s new LinkBuds Clip and noise reduction technology that actually lessened some distractions. These aren’t the perfect set of open earbuds, but they have a lot more to offer than most of the competition. Design Shokz has a number of over-the-ear hook earbud designs under its belt, and they all carry the OpenFit name. That is also an apt description of these products since they all sit outside of your ear canal, which inherently allows you to remain aware of your surroundings. The company currently offers the OpenFit 2 and 2+ in addition to the OpenFit Air, at prices ranging from $120 to $200. The OpenFit Pro looks similar to its predecessors, albeit with a slightly smaller main housing and more pops of silver. Those ear hooks have a titanium wire inside and are wrapped in “ultra-soft” silicone. They’re plenty flexible and provide a secure yet comfortable fit for daily wear and workouts. Both earbuds of the OpenFit Pro have tiny physical controls for media playback, volume adjustments, calls and noise settings. The various actions are customizable through the Shokz app. During several weeks of testing, these buttons responded quickly to my clicks and using them didn’t cause the OpenFit Pro to shift out of place. The OpenFit Pro comes with a charging case that's larger than most other earbuds, which is understandable since Shokz had to accommodate that ear hook. However, the case is quite flat, so it doesn’t take up too much room and easily fits in a small pocket. There’s a USB-C port around back for charging and a Bluetooth pairing button inside. The case also supports wireless charging, if your charging pad is large enough. Noise reduction vs. noise cancellation The OpenFit Pro is the first set of Shokz earbuds with what the company calls Open-Ear Noise Reduction. This is essentially the company’s take on active noise cancellation (ANC), but it’s designed to be effective with earbuds that don’t enter your ear canals. Since your ears aren't completely sealed off from the noise of the outside world, Shokz is limited in just how much sound it can reduce. But I’m happy to report the company’s microphone and algorithm combo is actually quite effective. Shokz says its noise reduction works best in moderately loud environments, like offices and cafes. I’ve found the OpenFit Pro does well to reduce the distraction of constant noise sources like HVAC systems, fans and white noise machines. The earbuds completely silenced a particularly raucous HVAC fan in my hotel room during CES. It's not the most effective at cutting down environmental noise, but in exchange you get a more comfortable set of earbuds while also remaining somewhat alert and aware of your surroundings Other OpenFit Pro features The rectangular housings of the OpenFit Pro hold larger drivers Billy Steele for Engadget The OpenFit Pro is Shokz’ most premium set of earbuds, so the features don’t end at noise reduction. Head tracking, customizable EQ, multipoint pairing, find my earbuds and wear detection are also available here. The company’s app displays battery percentages for each earbud and the case right at the top of the main screen with access to the rest of its tools just below. You don’t have to go searching and tapping through menus until you’ve found what you’re looking for. As someone who has to contend with a lot of headphone apps, I appreciate when all of the options are quickly available from the home screen. Like other companies offer on their open-type earbuds, Shokz has given the EQ settings a few presets specifically designed for the open nature of the product. Those include a Vocal option that boosts mids for audiobooks or calls and a Private mode that reduces high frequency sounds to prevent leakage. I usually kept the OpenFit Pro around 70 percent volume, which is loud enough that a nearby neighbor in a quiet room could hear the muffled rage of Incendiary’s “Echo of Nothing.” Another audio feature that’s worth mentioning is Dolby Atmos support. More specifically, the OpenFit Pro is “optimized for Dolby Atmos,” thanks in part to the aforementioned Dolby Head Tracking. You can disable the enhanced audio and head tracking individually in the Shokz app, but I found leaving Atmos on all the time, even when I wasn’t listening to Dolby Atmos music, gave the earbuds a more immersive, more detailed sound profile. Sound quality and calls Overall sound quality is another area where the OpenFit Pro shines. Many open-design earbuds struggle to manage much bass or detailed highs, both of which Shokz has addressed with its driver design. Dual 11x20mm diaphragms power a larger, rectangular driver that’s the equivalent of a 16.7mm round driver in a “normal” set of earbuds. For comparison, most in-ear models typically use 10-12mm drivers, with smaller designs housing 6-8mm units. Shokz says it tuned the OpenFit Pro with what it calls OpenBass 2.0 and DirectPitch 3.0, features that provide better bass performance and audio that’s beamed more directly into your ears. All of that combines for some truly impressive audio performance in a set of open earbuds. The OpenFit Pro still doesn’t muster the bombastic bass that earbuds like the WF-1000XM5 offer, but the low-end performance here is greatly improved over other open models like the LinkBuds Clip. While Thrice’s “Silhouette” still has enough driving kick drum, bass guitar and riffs to do the track justice, there isn’t as deep of a growl as the song has on flagship options from Bose, Sony and Sennheiser. The OpenFit Pro case is large, but it's not overly bulky Billy Steele for Engadget There’s also more clarity and detail in the tuning here than on other open models, which is on full display when listening to albums like Wet Leg’s alternative masterpiece moisturizer. I love how I can hear the texture of the guitars and drums, and even the vocals, which are the kind of subtle details open earbuds typically lack. I should also mention that overall sound quality will depend on how the OpenFit Pro sits on your ears. I can easily improve the bass tone if I slightly push the earbuds in closer to my ear canals, but all of the observations I just made were with the earbuds in their natural resting position. Shokz says the three-microphone setup that assists with its noise reduction tech also helps with calls. That configuration, combined with AI-powered voice recognition, should be able to block over 99 percent of background noise and deliver sharper vocal clarity overall. While that first part holds true — the OpenFit Pro does a great job canceling any ambient roar — the overall voice quality here is below average. It will certainly work for casual chats, but I wouldn’t recommend it for regular work calls or any scenario where you might need to record what you’re saying. My voice sounded muffled during calls and voice memos, more like I would over speakerphone than a set of carefully tuned earbuds. OpenFit Pro battery life Shokz promises up to 12 hours of battery life on the OpenFit Pro with up to 50 hours of total use when you factor in the charging case. That’s with noise reduction disabled though; you can expect up to six hours with that turned on (24 hours total with the case). During weeks of testing, I never encountered any issues hitting those figures and the OpenFit Pro never struggled to get through a full work day of music, podcasts and calls using a combination of the default Open Mode and Noise Reduction mode. As I mentioned, the charging case can be topped up wirelessly if you have a compatible accessory that’s large enough. And if you find yourself with a pair of completely dead earbuds, Shokz includes a quick-charge feature that gives you up to four hours of use in 10 minutes. The competition The OpenFit Pro earbuds sitting in their charging case Billy Steele for Engadget If you’re looking for something that closely resembles the design of the OpenFit Pro, Shokz’ other OpenFit models are likely your best alternatives. The $200 OpenFit 2+ offers 11 hours of battery life and Dolby Audio with both physical buttons and touch controls. The most affordable option, the OpenFit Air ($120), lasts up to six hours on a charge but doesn’t have enhanced audio or wireless charging. As you step down from the OpenFit Pro, you’re missing out on noise reduction, Dolby Atmos and longer battery life. JBL will soon have three models of its own to rival the Shokz OpenFit line. The Soundgear Sense is currently available for $165 and the Sense Pro and Sense Lite are coming in March for $200 and $150, respectively. These all have a variety of seemingly handy features, but none of them offer any kind of noise reduction and they all have shorter battery life than the OpenFit Pro and OpenFit 2+. I also cannot vouch for them as I haven’t tested any of JBL’s open designs yet. Wrap-up Shokz has achieved a rare feat. The company managed to build a set of open-fit earbuds that retain all of those inherent benefits while also providing some relief from distractions with noise reduction. No, the over-the-ear hook design isn’t for everyone — especially if you wear glasses — but the comfy, secure fit and IP55 rating make these a great choice for workouts. The OpenFit Pro is also good enough to be your all-around set of earbuds, and that noise reduction can be beneficial in the office or your favorite work from home space. Sound quality is better than you’ll find on most open earbuds as well, but you’ll probably enjoy not having anything crammed into your ears most. And you don’t have to make too many sacrifices here for that satisfaction.

          "standfirst": "Amazon has confirmed that it’s letting go of 16,000 workers and employees across its organization. In an announcement by company SVP Beth Galetti, she explained that Amazon was going through organizational changes to reduce layers and remove bureaucracy. Affected employees in the US will be given 90 days to look for another internal role and will receive severance pay if they do not find any. Galetti also said that Amazon doesn’t have plans to announce “broad reductions every few months” but admitted that the company could “make adjustments as appropriate.”News about the layoffs was leaked in an email mistakenly sent out early to workers, along with a calendar invitation for a meeting dubbed internally as “Project Dawn.” In the email seen by Bloomberg and the BBC, Amazon Web Services Senior Vice President Colleen Aubrey told workers that their “impacted colleagues” from the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been notified. “Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,” Aubrey reportedly wrote in the email. Amazon eliminated 14,000 roles back in October 2025 across its games, logistics, payment and cloud computing divisions, with the availability of AI technologies being one of the main reasons for the layoffs. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,” Amazon said in its announcement back then. This new round of layoffs is just a continuation of the previous one, as Amazon was reportedly looking to let 30,000 people go from the start. The announcement comes shortly after Amazon revealed that it was shutting down its remaining Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh physical stores and will focus on grocery deliveries instead. To note, Amazon’s year-over-year net sales grew by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2025 alone. Its net income increased to $21.2 billion compared to the $15.3 billion it posted in the third quarter of 2024.

          "title": "Windscribe review: Despite the annoyances, it has the right idea",
          "standfirst": "Windscribe is a virtual private network (VPN) with intense \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" energy. It has servers in 69 countries and an annual plan that costs $69, an obsession with the sex number that rivals Elon Musk's. I'm shocked that it doesn't have a subscription costing $4.20 per month. But there's another side to Windscribe's cringe: an obsession with independence and a Bernie Sanders-like anger on behalf of an exploited public. In a market where the best VPNs aim for professionalism, Windscribe aspires to be punk. Its iconoclasm may have led it to develop an app that looks like ExpressVPN in a trash compactor, but it also spurred Windscribe to offer a strong free plan and forgo financial relationships with VPN reviewers. That attitude earned it a spot on my list of the best free VPNs. Although Windscribe's heart is in the right place, my job is to figure out whether that translates into a good product. I used our rigorous VPN testing procedure to rate Windscribe in 11 categories. You can find my results in the table below and a final verdict at the end of the review. Editor's note (1/27/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Findings at a glance Category Notes Installation and UI Installation and setup are always straightforwardApps look very similar on Windows, macOS, iOS and AndroidApp design is overly compact and often impenetrable, but hides a solid programBrowser extensions allow one-click bypassing of security features on the current page, much like common ad blockers Speed Average latency below 300 worldwideSome slowdown in download and upload speeds, but not severeSpeeds were highly consistent everywhere except some African servers Security Six solid protocols — WireGuard, IKEv2, and four based on OpenVPNMost protocols available on all platforms, except IKEv2 on AndroidNo leaks detected, even while switching serversPackets are encrypted as expected Pricing $9 per month, $69 for one year ($5.75 per month)Custom plans cost $1 per country plus $1 for unlimited data; must spend at least $3Static IPs available for $2 per month or $8 per month for a residential addressFree plan gives you 10 locations and 10GB per month with a confirmed email Bundles Shares coupon codes for various discounts on five \"partners in privacy\" Privacy policy Retains very little information, none of it personally identifiableCan make an account without an email addressAll apps have been audited by independent overseersFought Greek court case in 2025 because it had no logs to turn over Virtual location change 15 different servers in five locations unblocked NetflixContent changed each time, suggesting the destination site was completely fooled Server network 193 server locations in 122 cities across 71 countriesOnly two virtual server locations in the entire networkReal servers in Russia and India risk abrupt shutdowns Features Standout extras include the customizable R.O.B.E.R.T blocker and split tunneling on Windows, Mac and AndroidNetwork Options offers lots of automation choices, but terminology makes it needlessly confusingIncludes obfuscation to get online in restrictive regionsFirewall is a stronger version of a kill switch, preventing any access unless the VPN is connected Customer support Knowledgebase search bar is good at finding articles, and articles themselves are usefulGarry AI chatbot is helpful, but pushed way too hard at the expense of access to human agentsActive Reddit and Discord communities for peer-to-peer help Background check Founded in Canada in 2016No significant controversies in 10 yearsCanada is a Five Eyes nation, but this shouldn't matter if Windscribe is keeping to its no logs policy Installing, configuring and using Windscribe The first step is always to figure out how easy or hard the VPN is to use. Windscribe and other VPNs are important tools, but you'll never use them if the UI gets in the way. I tested Windscribe's desktop apps on Windows and Mac, its mobile apps on iOS and Android and its Chrome and Firefox browser extensions. To start with, let me say that installing Windscribe is a breeze no matter where you do it. The downloaders and installers handle their own business, only requiring you to grant a few permissions. The apps arrive on your system ready to use out of the box. Windows The first thing you'll notice about Windscribe is that it's not even slightly interested in looking like any other VPN. It crams everything into an extremely compact window, which has some advantages — mainly that it's easy to operate it while looking at another app. On the downside, well, it looks like this. Windscribe's UI on a Windows laptop. Sam Chapman for Engadget The Windscribe team will probably just say that I'm brainwashed by the establishment, but there's a good reason that most VPNs choose designs with a little more space. This fiddly console, most of which is taken up by information you can't interact with, is likely to confirm all a newcomer's worst fears about using a VPN. Private Internet Access had a similar problem of tightening its app design to the point of being incomprehensible. The problems persist when you get to the settings page. It's easy to make sense of a VPN without technical knowledge, but Windscribe's preferences menu does everything it can to obscure that truth. Highly technical features are mixed in with options for casual users, and the explanatory blurbs usually cloud the issue even further. Even the \"Look & Feel\" settings somehow manage to be confusing. What is the difference between the Stretch, Fill and Tile modes for aspect ratio? What the heck is a Bundled background, and what does it matter whether it's Square, Palm, Ripple, Drip or Snow? The answers to all these can be found by playing around or looking in the knowledgebase, but a VPN really shouldn't require that for its most basic toggles. Once you get used to Windscribe and learn where to find the features that actually matter, it runs quite smoothly. Connections are never delayed and there are none of the random error messages that have dogged me on other VPNs. In a world of VPNs that look great but run clunkily, Windscribe has built one that looks terrible but runs great. I can't complain about how well it works, but is it too much to ask for a provider that does both? (Oh, wait, that's Proton VPN.) Mac Windscribe's macOS app is almost identical to its Windows app. That deserves praise in itself — you'll get much the same experience no matter which type of computer you use. But it also means the Mac app shares the same problems. Windscribe's app for Mac desktops and laptops. Sam Chapman for Engadget There's the same overly compact design cluttered with too much information. The same technobabble-filled options menu. And the same fundamental solidity underlying it all: a VPN that does the job beautifully but has no interest in being accessible. It would be a mistake to write Windscribe off because of its app design, but it's important to know what you'll have to work through. Android One thing I can't fault Windscribe for is a lack of consistency. The Android app looks a lot like the Windows and Mac apps, only lightly adapted for the mobile format. On these devices, the design decisions make more sense — the UI writing is still impenetrable for casual users, but the compact pages look a lot more normal on a phone screen. A comparison of Windscribe's extremely similar apps on Android and Mac. Sam Chapman for Engadget iOS There's not a lot to say about Windscribe on iOS that I haven't already said about the other three main platforms. Looking over all my screenshots, it seems fairly clear that Windscribe's problems — much like PIA's — come from starting on mobile and trying to make that same design work on desktop. It's still not great to look at, but I can at least see where they're coming from. Windscribe's iOS app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Browser extensions Windscribe's extensions for Chrome and Firefox look a little like its desktop and mobile VPN apps, but they act a little differently. They serve the same basic purpose as the standalone apps — changing your IP address and location — but they're also customizable ad blockers for the web page you're currently on. Windscribe's Google Chrome extension. Sam Chapman for Engadget For example, in the image above, I can control what location Google perceives me to be in. But I can also control what gets blocked by choosing to let Google bypass certain features. Clicking the leftmost button makes the current website skip the VPN tunnel. The central button shuts off the ad blocker and the right-hand button shuts off the features on the Privacy section of the preferences menu. Like everything else about Windscribe, it's unintuitive but works great once you figure it out. Windscribe speed test I used speedtest.net to test Windscribe's speeds. In case you aren't familiar with the jargon, Ping measures a server's latency, which is how long it takes a single packet of data to reach it from your device. Download speed measures how much data can be downloaded at a time, while upload speed shows how quickly you can send data to the network. Think of ping as your car's speed in miles per hour and download and upload speed as the amount of traffic on the road. As usual, I used the WireGuard protocol to run these tests, since it's almost always the fastest. Starting with my unprotected speeds at home in Portland, I moved gradually farther away until I was connecting to the other side of the world. Ideally, ping should increase linearly (not exponentially), while download and upload speeds don't dip much at all. I've recorded Windscribe's performance in the table below. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 22 — 59.35 — 5.92 — Vancouver, Canada (fastest location) 27 1.2x 55.89 5.83 5.56 6.08 Boston, USA 161 7.3x 48.49 18.30 5.66 4.39 Quito, Ecuador 283 12.9x 46.46 21.72 4.68 20.95 London, UK 287 13.0x 43.70 26.37 4.51 23.82 Nairobi, Kenya 595 27.0x 32.63 45.02 3.57 39.70 Seoul, South Korea 258 11.7x 43.27 27.09 4.48 24.32 Average 269 12.2x 45.07 24.06 4.74 19.93 Windscribe gave me some of the shortest latencies I've ever seen — comparable to CyberGhost, whose ping lengths I was also very impressed by. Its download and upload speeds also look a lot like CyberGhost's, with both firmly in good-but-not-amazing territory. However, Windscribe's speeds were a lot more consistent. Throughout the tests, I hardly ever saw major fluctuations in the same location, on any metric. The Nairobi server seemed to be under some strain, but that's not unusual for a VPN in Africa. Every location except for that one followed a smooth downward curve. I'm happy with that; speed is one of the areas where you want your VPN to be reliably boring, not flashy. Practically, a speed test like this suggests that Windscribe is best for gaming, livestreaming and video chatting, and that it's perfectly serviceable for any other task you could do online. You may not get the best speeds you've ever seen, but unless your internet is bad to begin with, Windscribe should not slow it down enough to be noticeable. Windscribe security test I can say up top that Windscribe doesn't seem to have any dangerous security flaws, but I'll take this section to explain why I think that. To start with, it uses only the three VPN protocols currently known to be secure: WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2, plus a few other options all based on OpenVPN. With those options, you can be sure you're getting encryption that's currently uncrackable. It also passed two batteries of tests I ran on its security. The first set of tests looks for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and other slip-ups that might reveal your real IP address. The second checks whether data packets sent through the VPN tunnel are actually getting encrypted. Check each section below for details on how Windscribe did. VPN protocols A VPN protocol determines how exactly a VPN makes contact between its own servers, your device and your ISP. Certain protocols can make your VPN run faster, stabilize a shaky connection or get into websites other protocols fail to unlock. If you're having a problem with your VPN, changing the protocol is one of the first troubleshooting steps. Windscribe makes a total of six protocols available, though it's really just three, since four of the six are variations on OpenVPN. WireGuard works on every platform, and is currently the fastest and most stable — its drawback used to be that it was new, but with the passage of time, it's no longer new enough to make it suspect. IKEv2 is a connection protocol that uses the separate IPSec protocol for its security. This double team's main strength is reconnecting to the VPN when a device switches networks; it's also good at not draining phone batteries. Windscribe supports IKEv2 on Mac, iOS and Windows. OpenVPN is the oldest open-source VPN protocol, refined by over a decade of repeated probing by volunteers. It's not only relatively fast and highly secure, but comes in two flavors: TCP, which makes connections more stable, and UDP, which is usually faster and should be your first resort with OpenVPN. Windscribe supports OpenVPN on all platforms. Windscribe rounds out the selection with two unique protocols, both focused on hiding your VPN traffic from firewalls and censors. Stealth uses the same connection ports as HTTPS, so it can't be blocked by shutting certain ports down entirely. WStunnel obfuscates connections even further by using the extremely common WebSocket technology to establish VPN connections. Both these proprietary protocols are much slower than the other options, but can save you if you find yourself repeatedly blocked while using Windscribe. Leak test I started my leak tests by using ipleak.net to check several Windscribe servers for IP leaks of all sorts. Each time I connected and checked my location, I only saw the VPN server's IP address, never my real one. I tried to trip Windscribe up by switching servers while remaining connected, even changing continents, but my true location never once slipped out. This puts its security solidly above CyberGhost, Norton VPN and many others. I couldn't find any holes in Windscribe's armor. Sam Chapman for Engadget Windscribe automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while connected, so IPv6 leaks weren't going to be a thing. I finished the test by checking five servers using browserleaks.com/webrtc, finding no issues each time. Encryption test The final step is to make sure Windscribe is applying encryption properly through its VPN protocols. For this test, I used a free packet sniffer app called Wireshark to look directly at what my computer was sending out. Windscribe's encryption looks solid. Sam Chapman for Engadget It's a bit hard to tell what's going on, but to summarize, I've loaded a website without HTTPS protection and checked whether Windscribe managed to apply that protection. The lack of readable information in the data stream proves that its encryption is indeed working as expected. How much does Windscribe cost? Windscribe has three subscription options (not counting its free plan, which I'll discuss in a moment). One month of Pro service costs $9.00 — after Mullvad, the second-cheapest monthly subscription to a top-tier VPN. You can also pay $69 for a 12-month Pro subscription, working out to $5.75 per month. Both of these tiers give you the exact same set of Pro features and can be used on unlimited simultaneous devices. The cost of Windscribe Pro at publication time. Sam Chapman for Engadget The third option is to build your own plan. Build-A-Plan is an interesting beast that's unique to Windscribe. When you choose a custom plan, you must spend at least $3 per month. Gaining access to all the Pro servers in a country costs $1. For each country you add, you get an additional 10GB of data per month on top of the 10GB already included for free. If you'd rather not budget your data at all, you can pay another $1 for unlimited data, plus 10 custom rules for the R.O.B.E.R.T. content blocker (I'll untangle the tortured acronym soon). It's a little convoluted, but wonderfully flexible. You can even change your Build-A-Plan in the middle of the subscription period. Windscribe also offers shared static IPs for an extra fee. You can add a datacenter IP to any plan for $2 per month or a residential IP (usually better at getting around restrictions) for $8 per month. Team billing is also available through ScribeForce at $3 per seat per month, including a centralized management panel. The Windscribe free plan Windscribe isn't the overall best free VPN — hide.me wins that honor with its more flexible data limit — but it's close. Free users get access to servers in 10 countries: the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Germany, Switzerland, Romania and Hong Kong. If you plot that on a map, you'll see that the Windscribe free plan is most useful in North America and Europe. Free users start with a data allotment of 2GB per month. The monthly limit rises to 10GB if you sign up with a confirmed email address and 15GB if you post about Windscribe on Twitter/X. That's enough for casual browsing, but streaming in standard definition takes about 1GB per hour, so you won't be doing much binge-watching. On the upside, a free plan gives you access to all Windscribe's features except for dynamic port forwarding. You can set three R.O.B.E.R.T. rules and use your free account on an infinite number of devices (subject to the usual restrictions about exploiting that for commercial purposes — as Windscribe itself states, no one person has 30 devices that need a VPN). Windscribe side apps and bundles Windscribe doesn't have any add-ons of its own except for static IP addresses. However, it does offer discount codes for a group of \"partners in privacy\" that share its business ethics. The coupon codes are available here and don't require a Windscribe subscription to use. The five members of Windscribe's gang. Sam Chapman for Engadget There are currently five allies in the gang. Control D offers DNS filtering for organizations to block unwanted websites; the Windscribe coupon gives you 50 percent off. You can get 25 percent off a one-year subscription to addy.io, an open-source email anonymizer, and Ente, an encrypted storage space for photos and videos. Rounding out the team are Kagi, a private search engine which you can use for three months free with the Windscribe coupon, and Notesnook, an encrypted notes app. Windscribe's coupon gives you a 10% discount on Notesnook's yearly plans in perpetuity. Close-reading Windscribe's privacy policy Windscribe's marketing positions it as serious about user independence, so I came into this section hoping for a privacy policy that backs those words up. An early green flag is that the policy is short, succinct and obviously written to be read by the users themselves. It's also fantastic that you can sign up without an email address (though you will need one to get the full data allotment on the free plan). Windscribe gathers information on its website using Piwik, an open-source analytics tool that it manages itself; no third parties are involved. The Windscribe app itself collects no information except for the amount of data used in a month, the time of your last connection and the number of devices you have online at once. When actively connected, it also gives you an anonymized username necessary for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols. My only quibble is that Windscribe is oddly reluctant to identify which third-party payment processors it uses. The information does exist elsewhere — an article in the knowledgebase states that payments are handled by \"trusted third party processors such as PayPal and Stripe,\" and another page says that CoinPayments handles cryptocurrency transactions. It's a small thing, but the rest of the policy is so airtight that it stands out. Independent privacy audits Windscribe's apps are fully open-source (you can find them on Github here). In addition to this general exposure, it's also undergone three intensive audits from security firms. Leviathan Security looked into its desktop apps in 2021 and its mobile apps in 2022. The auditors made a total of five high-severity recommendations, all of which Windscribe claims to have addressed. More recently, Windscribe had its entire codebase audited by PacketLabs. The auditors' June 2024 report found that some of Windscribe's code was storing more user information than it strictly needed to. Windscribe also claims to have handled this risk. More importantly, PacketLabs found no intentional subversions of Windscribe's no-logs policy, so its privacy statements can likely be trusted. Further corroboration of the latter came from a 2025 court case in which Windscribe founder and CEO Yegor Sak was indicted in Greece and charged with a crime committed by a Windscribe user through an IP address in Finland. This case is obviously absurd — like charging the head of GM with a single instance of vehicular manslaughter committed by someone driving a Buick — but Sak was obliged to appear in court anyway. As Sak writes in the linked post, he could have turned over the logs and shown who actually committed the crime, but he couldn't since Windscribe doesn't keep that information. Had there been an alternative to waging an expensive and inconvenient legal campaign in another country, Sak would surely have taken it. The fact that he didn't is strong proof of Windscribe's no-logging policy. Can Windscribe change your virtual location? Changing your IP address with a VPN can do more than just anonymize your internet activity. A service like Windscribe can give you an IP address associated with a certain country or region, letting you use the internet like you were there. This has applications ranging from the serious (break out of a nationwide firewall to document human rights issues) to the fun (get new titles on streaming platforms without paying for a new subscription). Netflix is a great tool for testing whether a VPN can change your virtual location. Like most streamers, it tries to block all VPN access to protect the copyrights it holds. Consequently, if a VPN can crack Netflix, it must be serious about keeping its server network fresh to foil any potential blockers. A successful location change on Netflix using Windscribe. Sam Chapman for Engadget For this test, I tried to access Netflix three times each through five different Windscribe server locations, refreshing the connection to use different servers each time. I looked for successful Netflix access, plus different content to prove my location had actually changed. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? Vancouver, Canada 3/3 3/3 Queretaro, Mexico 3/3 3/3 Tokyo, Japan 3/3 3/3 London, UK 3/3 3/3 Auckland, NZ 3/3 3/3 Windscribe got a perfect score. Netflix loaded easily every time, and the content was always localized to the country I chose. With this performance combined with its fairly consistent speeds over long distances, Windscribe makes a nearly perfect streaming VPN. The only downside is that the data limits on the free plan mean you'll probably have to pay for serious streaming time. Investigating Windscribe's server network Windscribe has 193 server locations in 71 countries, which it insists on listing as \"69+\" (again, hilarious). Although 193 sounds like a lot, many of them are duplicate locations in the same city. This isn't necessarily a problem, but for accuracy's sake, the total number of cities with Windscribe servers is 122. Region Countries with servers Cities with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 6 40 61 0 South America 7 7 9 0 Europe 38 47 75 0 Africa 3 3 5 0 Middle East 2 2 2 0 Asia 12 16 28 1 Oceania 2 6 12 0 Antarctica 1 1 1 1 Total 71 122 193 2 (1 percent) The bigger story here is Windscribe's spurning of virtual servers. A virtual server location is physically located in a different region than the one it outwardly displays. For example, a server with an Indian IP address might really be in Singapore. Throughout the entire Windscribe network, only two servers are virtual: one in India and one in Antarctica. This is both good and bad. On the positive side, the near-total lack of virtual servers means you can be sure of how any server will perform. If it says it's in Buenos Aires, it'll run like it's in Buenos Aires — you won't be surprised with lagging speeds because it's really in Miami. This also makes it clear that Windscribe isn't interested in pumping up its network size for marketing purposes. Windscribe's server selection list on the Mac app. Sam Chapman for Engadget On the other hand, virtual locations aren't an inherently bad thing. Windscribe acts as though advertising hype is the only reason any VPN would employ them, but there are real use cases. Virtual servers can be used to place locations inside countries where real servers would risk confiscation by the government, like Russia, India and China. Windscribe chooses instead to place real servers in Russia and India, both of which have data retention laws that directly conflict with its own privacy policy. Does this mean that using Windscribe's Russian servers will earn you a midnight visit from the FSB? Probably not. Assuming Windscribe is following its no-logs policy (which appears to be the case), there won't be any user data on those servers if the government seizes them. But it does mean they're effectively running illegal data centers which could be raided and shut down at any time. Be aware of this if you depend on Windscribe's locations in Russia or India. Extra features of Windscribe As covered in the UI section, Windscribe has a lot going on in its apps. The Connection tab alone has 13 different features, including two submenus with several options of their own. With this many options, and so many of them highly situational, I won't be able to cover every nook and cranny without this review getting seriously bloated. I've instead chosen some of the most important and illustrative features to give you a clear sense of the whole picture. Network Options You'll find this feature at the top of the Connection tab. When you click Network Options, you should see the name of your current Wi-Fi network and all the others your Windscribe account has discovered. This feature lets you control how the VPN reacts to each network it encounters, not unlike CyberGhost's Smart Rules. Just switching around a few terms would make this a lot less confusing. Sam Chapman for Engadget The app does a remarkably poor job of explaining how this works, so I'll break it down for you here. When the Auto-Secure Networks switch is turned on, Windscribe will automatically mark each new network as Secured — a word which here means \"Windscribe turns on when it encounters the network.\" So far, so good. But if you turn Auto-Secure Networks off, things get weird. Without it, Windscribe tags every network you encounter as Unsecured. Whenever you connect to an Unsecured network, Windscribe immediately disconnects itself. This means it secures all Secured networks and does not secure any Unsecured networks. It feels backwards until you realize that Windscribe is referring entirely to itself here. \"Secured\" doesn't mean that the Wi-Fi network is password-protected or otherwise considered safe, and \"Unsecured\" doesn't mean that it's open to the public without a password. All that matters is whether or not you want Windscribe to activate or deactivate on that network. It's a useful feature that even lets you choose a VPN protocol for each network, but it would help to bring it more in line with mainstream terminology. R.O.B.E.R.T. This mouthful of a feature name allegedly stands for Remote Omnidirectional Badware Eliminating Robotic Tool. This is perhaps the apex of the VPN industry's unfortunate habit of saddling perfectly good features with word-salad names (yes, I'm aware it's supposed to be funny). R.O.B.E.R.T. is perhaps the most customizable content blocker on any VPN right now. To start with, it includes eight lists of sites it blocks at the DNS level: Malware, Ad + Trackers, Social Networks, Porn, Gambling, Clickbait, Other VPNs and Crypto. These vary in usefulness, and you can't determine the contents of each list, but it's nice to have such a range of choices. It eliminates all the badware, remotely AND omnidirectionally! Sam Chapman for Engadget Where R.O.B.E.R.T really shines, though, is in its browser-based customization dashboard. Each Free user can make three custom rules, and Pro upgrades that to 10. Each custom rule can be used to block a specific website or network or allowlist it from one of the other general blocklists. You can also set it to spoof a domain, though there's no practical reason to do this (Windscribe's idea of a \"useful\" application is making your friends think your post made the front page of Reddit). Split tunneling Split tunneling sends some of your internet requests through the VPN tunnel while others go unencrypted as normal. This can be useful if you get worse-than-usual speeds and want to minimize the amount of traffic going through the VPN, or for certain websites that refuse to work with any VPN server. You can split tunnel on Windscribe's apps for Windows, Mac and Android. Windows and Android users can split by app or website, while Mac users can only split by website. Windscribe lets you choose whether your split tunnel will be inclusive (only apps and IPs on the list will go through the VPN) or exclusive (the apps and IPs on the list will not go through the VPN). Note that R.O.B.E.R.T. rules apply to the entire system, even excluded apps and domains. Firewall and Always On VPN Instead of a kill switch, which it derides as an incomplete solution, Windscribe includes a Firewall feature on desktop and an Always On VPN feature on mobile. The Firewall can be considered a strong kill switch that prevents any internet traffic from going outside the VPN tunnel — something doesn't have to go wrong for the blocks to activate. Always On VPN on iOS and Android is functionally the same. A more proactive defense has its advantages, but it would be nice if Windscribe included the weak kill switch option. Kill switches and firewalls can be overactive, and sometimes, you don't want the strongest level of security. Circumvent Censorship This feature is designed to let you access Windscribe on networks that don't want you to use a VPN, from school and work systems to entire censorious countries like China. Windscribe isn't forthcoming about how it works, but it's probably a deep-packet obfuscation that makes VPN traffic look like regular traffic. I didn't have time to pop over to China and test Circumvent Censorship, but I'm glad it exists. Windscribe customer support options Clicking the question mark tab on the Windscribe app shows you the full list of support options. You can peruse the knowledgebase, ask their chatbot Garry, talk directly to a human or check out their user communities on Reddit and Discord. Most of these lead back to Garry. Sam Chapman for Engadget I started with the written FAQs. At the top of the knowledgebase, there's a row of buttons you can click to see only articles relating to a particular operating system. This is a good idea in theory, but it's not implemented very well — there's no visible tagging system, so we can't see how it's deciding which articles to filter. The search bar is much more likely to get you where you need to go. It works instantaneously and always turns up relevant articles, though it's weirdly insistent on showing exactly 10 results. I have few complaints about articles themselves, which are written in a way any user should find useful (give or take yet more attempted humor). I tested the chatbot, Garry, by asking it about the mysterious Advanced Parameters tab of the Windscribe app. It explained each feature on that tab (none of which should be touched except by users with technical knowledge) in a spiel that was clearly pre-written but nonetheless useful. Garry was launched in 2018, when IBM Watson was the biggest thing in AI, and recently revamped into \"Garry 2.0\" — whether this is based on OpenAI or another platform is anyone's guess at the moment. Live support Windscribe appears to handle all of its own support, without outsourcing to Zendesk or a similar third party. If you decide not to go through Garry, Windscribe does have the option of connecting directly to a human. However, the Contact Humans option on the app sends you directly back to Garry. It's eventually possible to get Garry to connect you to a real person, but that doesn't excuse Windscribe building an outright lie into its app. The Contact Support button on the knowledgebase, which I expected to lead to a ticket submission, also sends you straight to Garry. Windscribe really, really wants you to use Garry, in case that wasn't clear. You might have a better time going straight to the Windscribe Discord server or the r/Windscribe subreddit, both of which are linked to in the app. Windscribe background check Windscribe eschews a lot of the things we've come to expect from a VPN provider. It doesn't pay for ads anywhere. It has no affiliate relationships with news sites. The only thing resembling a Windscribe ad campaign is the free-plan data reward for Xeeting about it. It doesn't even have any venture capital investors — it's completely self-funded and self-hosted. As a jaded and cynical reviewer who was already annoyed by Windscribe's memelord attitude, I was prepared to sniff out any hypocrisy in its background, which makes it all the more impressive that I didn't find any. Since its founding in Canada in 2016, Windscribe has never once been involved in any public doings that contradict its statements of ethics. It's even given free unlimited VPN access to every journalist working in Ukraine. The only thing I could find resembling a controversy was an incident in July 2021 when Ukrainian police confiscated two servers that weren't fully encrypted. Although this would only have posed a risk to users running a customized connection profile under very specific conditions, it was still a lapse. Windscribe responded appropriately in my view, ending the legacy OpenVPN implementation that caused the problem. Canadian headquarters Windscribe is based in Canada, which is one of the Five Eyes nations (along with the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand). This sounds scary, but it's not actually an issue, as Yegor Sak himself points out in a blog post I reference frequently. Five Eyes is not an organization, but an agreement between five allied countries to share necessary intelligence with each other. This can absolutely be misused. If the U.S. government wants to spy on someone without running into the 4th Amendment, it can ask the Brits to spy on that person instead and tell them what they find, knowing the Constitution can't determine what other countries do to our citizens. As bad as that is for our civil liberties, it doesn't actually change anything where VPNs are concerned. If a VPN isn't logging user data, there shouldn't be anything for any of the Five Eyes (or Nine Eyes or Fourteen Eyes) nations to find. And if it is keeping logs, you shouldn't be using it no matter where its headquarters are. Final verdict You might wonder, at this point, why my distaste for Windscribe's tryhard sense of humor has featured so prominently in this review. One reason is that I had to read a lot of it this week, and you must suffer as I have suffered. But it also makes Windscribe look very good by implication. Having no patience for the discount-4chan act that pervades Windscribe's brand, I was primed to dislike the VPN itself — and I simply couldn't. This is not to say I had no problems at all with Windscribe. Its physical servers in Russia are difficult to trust. Its help options lean way too heavily on Garry the chatbot. Its app design and UI writing are significant faults. The free plan doesn't give you enough data for streaming. Having said all that, though, Windscribe does everything else right. It changes virtual locations and unblocks Netflix without breaking a sweat. Its servers keep latencies low, and download speeds remain solid across the world. The apps may look bad, but they never break down. Some features, like R.O.B.E.R.T. and Auto-Secure, are both useful to everybody and deeply customizable for power users. Windscribe may be best for privacy nerds who know how all its doohickeys work, but it's a VPN I recommend for everybody. In a world of predatory software, it's a relief to use an app that's unabashedly on the customer's side.

          "content": "Windscribe is a virtual private network (VPN) with intense \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" energy. It has servers in 69 countries and an annual plan that costs $69, an obsession with the sex number that rivals Elon Musk's. I'm shocked that it doesn't have a subscription costing $4.20 per month. But there's another side to Windscribe's cringe: an obsession with independence and a Bernie Sanders-like anger on behalf of an exploited public. In a market where the best VPNs aim for professionalism, Windscribe aspires to be punk. Its iconoclasm may have led it to develop an app that looks like ExpressVPN in a trash compactor, but it also spurred Windscribe to offer a strong free plan and forgo financial relationships with VPN reviewers. That attitude earned it a spot on my list of the best free VPNs. Although Windscribe's heart is in the right place, my job is to figure out whether that translates into a good product. I used our rigorous VPN testing procedure to rate Windscribe in 11 categories. You can find my results in the table below and a final verdict at the end of the review. Editor's note (1/27/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.

Windscribe and other VPNs are important tools, but you'll never use them if the UI gets in the way. I tested Windscribe's desktop apps on Windows and Mac, its mobile apps on iOS and Android and its Chrome and Firefox browser extensions. To start with, let me say that installing Windscribe is a breeze no matter where you do it. The downloaders and installers handle their own business, only requiring you to grant a few permissions. The apps arrive on your system ready to use out of the box. Windows The first thing you'll notice about Windscribe is that it's not even slightly interested in looking like any other VPN. It crams everything into an extremely compact window, which has some advantages — mainly that it's easy to operate it while looking at another app. On the downside, well, it looks like this. Windscribe's UI on a Windows laptop. Sam Chapman for Engadget The Windscribe team will probably just say that I'm brainwashed by the establishment, but there's a good reason that most VPNs choose designs with a little more space. This fiddly console, most of which is taken up by information you can't interact with, is likely to confirm all a newcomer's worst fears about using a VPN. Private Internet Access had a similar problem of tightening its app design to the point of being incomprehensible. The problems persist when you get to the settings page. It's easy to make sense of a VPN without technical knowledge, but Windscribe's preferences menu does everything it can to obscure that truth. Highly technical features are mixed in with options for casual users, and the explanatory blurbs usually cloud the issue even further. Even the \"Look & Feel\" settings somehow manage to be confusing. What is the difference between the Stretch, Fill and Tile modes for aspect ratio? What the heck is a Bundled background, and what does it matter whether it's Square, Palm, Ripple, Drip or Snow? The answers to all these can be found by playing around or looking in the knowledgebase, but a VPN really shouldn't require that for its most basic toggles. Once you get used to Windscribe and learn where to find the features that actually matter, it runs quite smoothly. Connections are never delayed and there are none of the random error messages that have dogged me on other VPNs. In a world of VPNs that look great but run clunkily, Windscribe has built one that looks terrible but runs great. I can't complain about how well it works, but is it too much to ask for a provider that does both? (Oh, wait, that's Proton VPN.) Mac Windscribe's macOS app is almost identical to its Windows app. That deserves praise in itself — you'll get much the same experience no matter which type of computer you use. But it also means the Mac app shares the same problems. Windscribe's app for Mac desktops and laptops. Sam Chapman for Engadget There's the same overly compact design cluttered with too much information. The same technobabble-filled options menu. And the same fundamental solidity underlying it all: a VPN that does the job beautifully but has no interest in being accessible. It would be a mistake to write Windscribe off because of its app design, but it's important to know what you'll have to work through. Android One thing I can't fault Windscribe for is a lack of consistency. The Android app looks a lot like the Windows and Mac apps, only lightly adapted for the mobile format. On these devices, the design decisions make more sense — the UI writing is still impenetrable for casual users, but the compact pages look a lot more normal on a phone screen. A comparison of Windscribe's extremely similar apps on Android and Mac. Sam Chapman for Engadget iOS There's not a lot to say about Windscribe on iOS that I haven't already said about the other three main platforms. Looking over all my screenshots, it seems fairly clear that Windscribe's problems — much like PIA's — come from starting on mobile and trying to make that same design work on desktop. It's still not great to look at, but I can at least see where they're coming from. Windscribe's iOS app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Browser extensions Windscribe's extensions for Chrome and Firefox look a little like its desktop and mobile VPN apps, but they act a little differently. They serve the same basic purpose as the standalone apps — changing your IP address and location — but they're also customizable ad blockers for the web page you're currently on. Windscribe's Google Chrome extension. Sam Chapman for Engadget For example, in the image above, I can control what location Google perceives me to be in. But I can also control what gets blocked by choosing to let Google bypass certain features. Clicking the leftmost button makes the current website skip the VPN tunnel. The central button shuts off the ad blocker and the right-hand button shuts off the features on the Privacy section of the preferences menu. Like everything else about Windscribe, it's unintuitive but works great once you figure it out. Windscribe speed test I used speedtest.net to test Windscribe's speeds. In case you aren't familiar with the jargon, Ping measures a server's latency, which is how long it takes a single packet of data to reach it from your device. Download speed measures how much data can be downloaded at a time, while upload speed shows how quickly you can send data to the network. Think of ping as your car's speed in miles per hour and download and upload speed as the amount of traffic on the road. As usual, I used the WireGuard protocol to run these tests, since it's almost always the fastest. Starting with my unprotected speeds at home in Portland, I moved gradually farther away until I was connecting to the other side of the world. Ideally, ping should increase linearly (not exponentially), while download and upload speeds don't dip much at all. I've recorded Windscribe's performance in the table below. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 22 — 59.35 — 5.92 — Vancouver, Canada (fastest location) 27 1.2x 55.89 5.83 5.56 6.08 Boston, USA 161 7.3x 48.49 18.30 5.66 4.39 Quito, Ecuador 283 12.9x 46.46 21.72 4.68 20.95 London, UK 287 13.0x 43.70 26.37 4.51 23.82 Nairobi, Kenya 595 27.0x 32.63 45.02 3.57 39.70 Seoul, South Korea 258 11.7x 43.27 27.09 4.48 24.32 Average 269 12.2x 45.07 24.06 4.74 19.93 Windscribe gave me some of the shortest latencies I've ever seen — comparable to CyberGhost, whose ping lengths I was also very impressed by. Its download and upload speeds also look a lot like CyberGhost's, with both firmly in good-but-not-amazing territory. However, Windscribe's speeds were a lot more consistent. Throughout the tests, I hardly ever saw major fluctuations in the same location, on any metric. The Nairobi server seemed to be under some strain, but that's not unusual for a VPN in Africa. Every location except for that one followed a smooth downward curve. I'm happy with that; speed is one of the areas where you want your VPN to be reliably boring, not flashy. Practically, a speed test like this suggests that Windscribe is best for gaming, livestreaming and video chatting, and that it's perfectly serviceable for any other task you could do online. You may not get the best speeds you've ever seen, but unless your internet is bad to begin with, Windscribe should not slow it down enough to be noticeable. Windscribe security test I can say up top that Windscribe doesn't seem to have any dangerous security flaws, but I'll take this section to explain why I think that. To start with, it uses only the three VPN protocols currently known to be secure: WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2, plus a few other options all based on OpenVPN. With those options, you can be sure you're getting encryption that's currently uncrackable. It also passed two batteries of tests I ran on its security. The first set of tests looks for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and other slip-ups that might reveal your real IP address. The second checks whether data packets sent through the VPN tunnel are actually getting encrypted. Check each section below for details on how Windscribe did. VPN protocols A VPN protocol determines how exactly a VPN makes contact between its own servers, your device and your ISP. Certain protocols can make your VPN run faster, stabilize a shaky connection or get into websites other protocols fail to unlock. If you're having a problem with your VPN, changing the protocol is one of the first troubleshooting steps. Windscribe makes a total of six protocols available, though it's really just three, since four of the six are variations on OpenVPN. WireGuard works on every platform, and is currently the fastest and most stable — its drawback used to be that it was new, but with the passage of time, it's no longer new enough to make it suspect. IKEv2 is a connection protocol that uses the separate IPSec protocol for its security. This double team's main strength is reconnecting to the VPN when a device switches networks; it's also good at not draining phone batteries. Windscribe supports IKEv2 on Mac, iOS and Windows. OpenVPN is the oldest open-source VPN protocol, refined by over a decade of repeated probing by volunteers. It's not only relatively fast and highly secure, but comes in two flavors: TCP, which makes connections more stable, and UDP, which is usually faster and should be your first resort with OpenVPN. Windscribe supports OpenVPN on all platforms. Windscribe rounds out the selection with two unique protocols, both focused on hiding your VPN traffic from firewalls and censors. Stealth uses the same connection ports as HTTPS, so it can't be blocked by shutting certain ports down entirely. WStunnel obfuscates connections even further by using the extremely common WebSocket technology to establish VPN connections. Both these proprietary protocols are much slower than the other options, but can save you if you find yourself repeatedly blocked while using Windscribe. Leak test I started my leak tests by using ipleak.net to check several Windscribe servers for IP leaks of all sorts. Each time I connected and checked my location, I only saw the VPN server's IP address, never my real one. I tried to trip Windscribe up by switching servers while remaining connected, even changing continents, but my true location never once slipped out. This puts its security solidly above CyberGhost, Norton VPN and many others. I couldn't find any holes in Windscribe's armor. Sam Chapman for Engadget Windscribe automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while connected, so IPv6 leaks weren't going to be a thing. I finished the test by checking five servers using browserleaks.com/webrtc, finding no issues each time. Encryption test The final step is to make sure Windscribe is applying encryption properly through its VPN protocols. For this test, I used a free packet sniffer app called Wireshark to look directly at what my computer was sending out. Windscribe's encryption looks solid. Sam Chapman for Engadget It's a bit hard to tell what's going on, but to summarize, I've loaded a website without HTTPS protection and checked whether Windscribe managed to apply that protection. The lack of readable information in the data stream proves that its encryption is indeed working as expected. How much does Windscribe cost? Windscribe has three subscription options (not counting its free plan, which I'll discuss in a moment). One month of Pro service costs $9.00 — after Mullvad, the second-cheapest monthly subscription to a top-tier VPN. You can also pay $69 for a 12-month Pro subscription, working out to $5.75 per month. Both of these tiers give you the exact same set of Pro features and can be used on unlimited simultaneous devices. The cost of Windscribe Pro at publication time. Sam Chapman for Engadget The third option is to build your own plan. Build-A-Plan is an interesting beast that's unique to Windscribe. When you choose a custom plan, you must spend at least $3 per month. Gaining access to all the Pro servers in a country costs $1. For each country you add, you get an additional 10GB of data per month on top of the 10GB already included for free. If you'd rather not budget your data at all, you can pay another $1 for unlimited data, plus 10 custom rules for the R.O.B.E.R.T. content blocker (I'll untangle the tortured acronym soon). It's a little convoluted, but wonderfully flexible. You can even change your Build-A-Plan in the middle of the subscription period. Windscribe also offers shared static IPs for an extra fee. You can add a datacenter IP to any plan for $2 per month or a residential IP (usually better at getting around restrictions) for $8 per month. Team billing is also available through ScribeForce at $3 per seat per month, including a centralized management panel. The Windscribe free plan Windscribe isn't the overall best free VPN — hide.me wins that honor with its more flexible data limit — but it's close. Free users get access to servers in 10 countries: the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Germany, Switzerland, Romania and Hong Kong. If you plot that on a map, you'll see that the Windscribe free plan is most useful in North America and Europe. Free users start with a data allotment of 2GB per month. The monthly limit rises to 10GB if you sign up with a confirmed email address and 15GB if you post about Windscribe on Twitter/X. That's enough for casual browsing, but streaming in standard definition takes about 1GB per hour, so you won't be doing much binge-watching. On the upside, a free plan gives you access to all Windscribe's features except for dynamic port forwarding. You can set three R.O.B.E.R.T. rules and use your free account on an infinite number of devices (subject to the usual restrictions about exploiting that for commercial purposes — as Windscribe itself states, no one person has 30 devices that need a VPN). Windscribe side apps and bundles Windscribe doesn't have any add-ons of its own except for static IP addresses. However, it does offer discount codes for a group of \"partners in privacy\" that share its business ethics. The coupon codes are available here and don't require a Windscribe subscription to use. The five members of Windscribe's gang. Sam Chapman for Engadget There are currently five allies in the gang. Control D offers DNS filtering for organizations to block unwanted websites; the Windscribe coupon gives you 50 percent off. You can get 25 percent off a one-year subscription to addy.io, an open-source email anonymizer, and Ente, an encrypted storage space for photos and videos. Rounding out the team are Kagi, a private search engine which you can use for three months free with the Windscribe coupon, and Notesnook, an encrypted notes app. Windscribe's coupon gives you a 10% discount on Notesnook's yearly plans in perpetuity. Close-reading Windscribe's privacy policy Windscribe's marketing positions it as serious about user independence, so I came into this section hoping for a privacy policy that backs those words up. An early green flag is that the policy is short, succinct and obviously written to be read by the users themselves. It's also fantastic that you can sign up without an email address (though you will need one to get the full data allotment on the free plan). Windscribe gathers information on its website using Piwik, an open-source analytics tool that it manages itself; no third parties are involved. The Windscribe app itself collects no information except for the amount of data used in a month, the time of your last connection and the number of devices you have online at once. When actively connected, it also gives you an anonymized username necessary for the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols. My only quibble is that Windscribe is oddly reluctant to identify which third-party payment processors it uses. The information does exist elsewhere — an article in the knowledgebase states that payments are handled by \"trusted third party processors such as PayPal and Stripe,\" and another page says that CoinPayments handles cryptocurrency transactions. It's a small thing, but the rest of the policy is so airtight that it stands out. Independent privacy audits Windscribe's apps are fully open-source (you can find them on Github here). In addition to this general exposure, it's also undergone three intensive audits from security firms. Leviathan Security looked into its desktop apps in 2021 and its mobile apps in 2022. The auditors made a total of five high-severity recommendations, all of which Windscribe claims to have addressed. More recently, Windscribe had its entire codebase audited by PacketLabs. The auditors' June 2024 report found that some of Windscribe's code was storing more user information than it strictly needed to. Windscribe also claims to have handled this risk. More importantly, PacketLabs found no intentional subversions of Windscribe's no-logs policy, so its privacy statements can likely be trusted. Further corroboration of the latter came from a 2025 court case in which Windscribe founder and CEO Yegor Sak was indicted in Greece and charged with a crime committed by a Windscribe user through an IP address in Finland. This case is obviously absurd — like charging the head of GM with a single instance of vehicular manslaughter committed by someone driving a Buick — but Sak was obliged to appear in court anyway. As Sak writes in the linked post, he could have turned over the logs and shown who actually committed the crime, but he couldn't since Windscribe doesn't keep that information. Had there been an alternative to waging an expensive and inconvenient legal campaign in another country, Sak would surely have taken it. The fact that he didn't is strong proof of Windscribe's no-logging policy. Can Windscribe change your virtual location? Changing your IP address with a VPN can do more than just anonymize your internet activity. A service like Windscribe can give you an IP address associated with a certain country or region, letting you use the internet like you were there. This has applications ranging from the serious (break out of a nationwide firewall to document human rights issues) to the fun (get new titles on streaming platforms without paying for a new subscription). Netflix is a great tool for testing whether a VPN can change your virtual location. Like most streamers, it tries to block all VPN access to protect the copyrights it holds. Consequently, if a VPN can crack Netflix, it must be serious about keeping its server network fresh to foil any potential blockers. A successful location change on Netflix using Windscribe. Sam Chapman for Engadget For this test, I tried to access Netflix three times each through five different Windscribe server locations, refreshing the connection to use different servers each time. I looked for successful Netflix access, plus different content to prove my location had actually changed. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? Vancouver, Canada 3/3 3/3 Queretaro, Mexico 3/3 3/3 Tokyo, Japan 3/3 3/3 London, UK 3/3 3/3 Auckland, NZ 3/3 3/3 Windscribe got a perfect score. Netflix loaded easily every time, and the content was always localized to the country I chose. With this performance combined with its fairly consistent speeds over long distances, Windscribe makes a nearly perfect streaming VPN. The only downside is that the data limits on the free plan mean you'll probably have to pay for serious streaming time. Investigating Windscribe's server network Windscribe has 193 server locations in 71 countries, which it insists on listing as \"69+\" (again, hilarious). Although 193 sounds like a lot, many of them are duplicate locations in the same city. This isn't necessarily a problem, but for accuracy's sake, the total number of cities with Windscribe servers is 122. Region Countries with servers Cities with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 6 40 61 0 South America 7 7 9 0 Europe 38 47 75 0 Africa 3 3 5 0 Middle East 2 2 2 0 Asia 12 16 28 1 Oceania 2 6 12 0 Antarctica 1 1 1 1 Total 71 122 193 2 (1 percent) The bigger story here is Windscribe's spurning of virtual servers. A virtual server location is physically located in a different region than the one it outwardly displays. For example, a server with an Indian IP address might really be in Singapore. Throughout the entire Windscribe network, only two servers are virtual: one in India and one in Antarctica. This is both good and bad. On the positive side, the near-total lack of virtual servers means you can be sure of how any server will perform. If it says it's in Buenos Aires, it'll run like it's in Buenos Aires — you won't be surprised with lagging speeds because it's really in Miami. This also makes it clear that Windscribe isn't interested in pumping up its network size for marketing purposes. Windscribe's server selection list on the Mac app. Sam Chapman for Engadget On the other hand, virtual locations aren't an inherently bad thing. Windscribe acts as though advertising hype is the only reason any VPN would employ them, but there are real use cases. Virtual servers can be used to place locations inside countries where real servers would risk confiscation by the government, like Russia, India and China. Windscribe chooses instead to place real servers in Russia and India, both of which have data retention laws that directly conflict with its own privacy policy. Does this mean that using Windscribe's Russian servers will earn you a midnight visit from the FSB? Probably not. Assuming Windscribe is following its no-logs policy (which appears to be the case), there won't be any user data on those servers if the government seizes them. But it does mean they're effectively running illegal data centers which could be raided and shut down at any time. Be aware of this if you depend on Windscribe's locations in Russia or India. Extra features of Windscribe As covered in the UI section, Windscribe has a lot going on in its apps. The Connection tab alone has 13 different features, including two submenus with several options of their own. With this many options, and so many of them highly situational, I won't be able to cover every nook and cranny without this review getting seriously bloated. I've instead chosen some of the most important and illustrative features to give you a clear sense of the whole picture. Network Options You'll find this feature at the top of the Connection tab. When you click Network Options, you should see the name of your current Wi-Fi network and all the others your Windscribe account has discovered. This feature lets you control how the VPN reacts to each network it encounters, not unlike CyberGhost's Smart Rules. Just switching around a few terms would make this a lot less confusing. Sam Chapman for Engadget The app does a remarkably poor job of explaining how this works, so I'll break it down for you here. When the Auto-Secure Networks switch is turned on, Windscribe will automatically mark each new network as Secured — a word which here means \"Windscribe turns on when it encounters the network.\" So far, so good. But if you turn Auto-Secure Networks off, things get weird. Without it, Windscribe tags every network you encounter as Unsecured. Whenever you connect to an Unsecured network, Windscribe immediately disconnects itself. This means it secures all Secured networks and does not secure any Unsecured networks. It feels backwards until you realize that Windscribe is referring entirely to itself here. \"Secured\" doesn't mean that the Wi-Fi network is password-protected or otherwise considered safe, and \"Unsecured\" doesn't mean that it's open to the public without a password. All that matters is whether or not you want Windscribe to activate or deactivate on that network. It's a useful feature that even lets you choose a VPN protocol for each network, but it would help to bring it more in line with mainstream terminology. R.O.B.E.R.T. This mouthful of a feature name allegedly stands for Remote Omnidirectional Badware Eliminating Robotic Tool. This is perhaps the apex of the VPN industry's unfortunate habit of saddling perfectly good features with word-salad names (yes, I'm aware it's supposed to be funny). R.O.B.E.R.T. is perhaps the most customizable content blocker on any VPN right now. To start with, it includes eight lists of sites it blocks at the DNS level: Malware, Ad + Trackers, Social Networks, Porn, Gambling, Clickbait, Other VPNs and Crypto. These vary in usefulness, and you can't determine the contents of each list, but it's nice to have such a range of choices. It eliminates all the badware, remotely AND omnidirectionally! Sam Chapman for Engadget Where R.O.B.E.R.T really shines, though, is in its browser-based customization dashboard. Each Free user can make three custom rules, and Pro upgrades that to 10. Each custom rule can be used to block a specific website or network or allowlist it from one of the other general blocklists. You can also set it to spoof a domain, though there's no practical reason to do this (Windscribe's idea of a \"useful\" application is making your friends think your post made the front page of Reddit). Split tunneling Split tunneling sends some of your internet requests through the VPN tunnel while others go unencrypted as normal. This can be useful if you get worse-than-usual speeds and want to minimize the amount of traffic going through the VPN, or for certain websites that refuse to work with any VPN server. You can split tunnel on Windscribe's apps for Windows, Mac and Android. Windows and Android users can split by app or website, while Mac users can only split by website. Windscribe lets you choose whether your split tunnel will be inclusive (only apps and IPs on the list will go through the VPN) or exclusive (the apps and IPs on the list will not go through the VPN). Note that R.O.B.E.R.T. rules apply to the entire system, even excluded apps and domains. Firewall and Always On VPN Instead of a kill switch, which it derides as an incomplete solution, Windscribe includes a Firewall feature on desktop and an Always On VPN feature on mobile. The Firewall can be considered a strong kill switch that prevents any internet traffic from going outside the VPN tunnel — something doesn't have to go wrong for the blocks to activate. Always On VPN on iOS and Android is functionally the same. A more proactive defense has its advantages, but it would be nice if Windscribe included the weak kill switch option. Kill switches and firewalls can be overactive, and sometimes, you don't want the strongest level of security. Circumvent Censorship This feature is designed to let you access Windscribe on networks that don't want you to use a VPN, from school and work systems to entire censorious countries like China. Windscribe isn't forthcoming about how it works, but it's probably a deep-packet obfuscation that makes VPN traffic look like regular traffic. I didn't have time to pop over to China and test Circumvent Censorship, but I'm glad it exists. Windscribe customer support options Clicking the question mark tab on the Windscribe app shows you the full list of support options. You can peruse the knowledgebase, ask their chatbot Garry, talk directly to a human or check out their user communities on Reddit and Discord. Most of these lead back to Garry. Sam Chapman for Engadget I started with the written FAQs. At the top of the knowledgebase, there's a row of buttons you can click to see only articles relating to a particular operating system. This is a good idea in theory, but it's not implemented very well — there's no visible tagging system, so we can't see how it's deciding which articles to filter. The search bar is much more likely to get you where you need to go. It works instantaneously and always turns up relevant articles, though it's weirdly insistent on showing exactly 10 results. I have few complaints about articles themselves, which are written in a way any user should find useful (give or take yet more attempted humor). I tested the chatbot, Garry, by asking it about the mysterious Advanced Parameters tab of the Windscribe app. It explained each feature on that tab (none of which should be touched except by users with technical knowledge) in a spiel that was clearly pre-written but nonetheless useful. Garry was launched in 2018, when IBM Watson was the biggest thing in AI, and recently revamped into \"Garry 2.0\" — whether this is based on OpenAI or another platform is anyone's guess at the moment. Live support Windscribe appears to handle all of its own support, without outsourcing to Zendesk or a similar third party. If you decide not to go through Garry, Windscribe does have the option of connecting directly to a human. However, the Contact Humans option on the app sends you directly back to Garry. It's eventually possible to get Garry to connect you to a real person, but that doesn't excuse Windscribe building an outright lie into its app. The Contact Support button on the knowledgebase, which I expected to lead to a ticket submission, also sends you straight to Garry. Windscribe really, really wants you to use Garry, in case that wasn't clear. You might have a better time going straight to the Windscribe Discord server or the r/Windscribe subreddit, both of which are linked to in the app. Windscribe background check Windscribe eschews a lot of the things we've come to expect from a VPN provider. It doesn't pay for ads anywhere. It has no affiliate relationships with news sites. The only thing resembling a Windscribe ad campaign is the free-plan data reward for Xeeting about it. It doesn't even have any venture capital investors — it's completely self-funded and self-hosted. As a jaded and cynical reviewer who was already annoyed by Windscribe's memelord attitude, I was prepared to sniff out any hypocrisy in its background, which makes it all the more impressive that I didn't find any. Since its founding in Canada in 2016, Windscribe has never once been involved in any public doings that contradict its statements of ethics. It's even given free unlimited VPN access to every journalist working in Ukraine. The only thing I could find resembling a controversy was an incident in July 2021 when Ukrainian police confiscated two servers that weren't fully encrypted. Although this would only have posed a risk to users running a customized connection profile under very specific conditions, it was still a lapse. Windscribe responded appropriately in my view, ending the legacy OpenVPN implementation that caused the problem. Canadian headquarters Windscribe is based in Canada, which is one of the Five Eyes nations (along with the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand). This sounds scary, but it's not actually an issue, as Yegor Sak himself points out in a blog post I reference frequently. Five Eyes is not an organization, but an agreement between five allied countries to share necessary intelligence with each other. This can absolutely be misused. If the U.S. government wants to spy on someone without running into the 4th Amendment, it can ask the Brits to spy on that person instead and tell them what they find, knowing the Constitution can't determine what other countries do to our citizens. As bad as that is for our civil liberties, it doesn't actually change anything where VPNs are concerned. If a VPN isn't logging user data, there shouldn't be anything for any of the Five Eyes (or Nine Eyes or Fourteen Eyes) nations to find. And if it is keeping logs, you shouldn't be using it no matter where its headquarters are. Final verdict You might wonder, at this point, why my distaste for Windscribe's tryhard sense of humor has featured so prominently in this review. One reason is that I had to read a lot of it this week, and you must suffer as I have suffered. But it also makes Windscribe look very good by implication. Having no patience for the discount-4chan act that pervades Windscribe's brand, I was primed to dislike the VPN itself — and I simply couldn't. This is not to say I had no problems at all with Windscribe. Its physical servers in Russia are difficult to trust. Its help options lean way too heavily on Garry the chatbot. Its app design and UI writing are significant faults. The free plan doesn't give you enough data for streaming. Having said all that, though, Windscribe does everything else right. It changes virtual locations and unblocks Netflix without breaking a sweat. Its servers keep latencies low, and download speeds remain solid across the world. The apps may look bad, but they never break down. Some features, like R.O.B.E.R.T. and Auto-Secure, are both useful to everybody and deeply customizable for power users. Windscribe may be best for privacy nerds who know how all its doohickeys work, but it's a VPN I recommend for everybody. In a world of predatory software, it's a relief to use an app that's unabashedly on the customer's side.

          "standfirst": "If vacuuming is your least favorite chore, employing a robot vacuum can save you time and stress while also making sure your home stays clean. While once most robo-vacs landed on the higher end of the price spectrum, that’s not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker with serious cleaning chops for $500 — sometimes even $300 or less. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection. After testing dozens of robot vacuums at various price points, I’ve narrowed down our top picks for the best budget robot vacuums you can buy right now. Best budget robot vacuums for 2026 Are robot vacuums worth it? Since I've tested dozens of robot vacuums, I'm often asked if these gadgets are \"worth it\" and I'd say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance. There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair. When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places. What to look for in a budget robot vacuum When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums. So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you're dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance. You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range. Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it. You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules. But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option. Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes. How we test robot vacuums When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more. Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it's ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. Budget robot vacuum FAQs Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair? Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a cordless vacuum since those tend to be more powerful overall. How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge? Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power. Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors? Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors. Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features? Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you're thinking of buying and look for \"smart mapping\" or \"smart home mapping\" in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.

          "title": "The best E Ink tablets for 2026",
          "standfirst": "E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Best E Ink tablets for 2026 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Onyx Boox Tab X C The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

(Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Onyx Boox Tab X C The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Presented by SAPTen years ago, Western Sugar made a decision that would prove prescient: move from on-premise SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. At the time, artificial intelligence wasn&#x27;t a priority on most roadmaps. The company was simply trying to escape what Director of Corporate Controlling, Richard Caluori, calls \"a trainwreck:” a heavily customized ERP system so laden with custom ABAP code that it had become unupgradable.Today, that early cloud adoption is proving to be the foundation for Western Sugar&#x27;s AI transformation. As SAP accelerates its rollout of business AI capabilities across finance, supply chain, HR, and more, Western Sugar finds itself uniquely positioned to take advantage of the technology.\"We didn&#x27;t move to the cloud thinking about AI,\" Caluori says. \"But that decision to embrace clean core principles and standardized processes turned out to be exactly what we needed when AI capabilities became available. The clean data, the standardized workflows, the disciplined processes, all of that groundwork we laid for basic operational reasons is now the foundation that makes AI work. We were ready without even knowing it.\"Building AI readiness with a clean core ERP foundationWestern Sugar&#x27;s journey began with a familiar enterprise problem: technical debt. Years of on-premise customization had created a system that was nearly impossible to maintain or upgrade. \"Because we were on premise, we could do our own coding in ABAP, and over the years we created such a mess with our internal coding that the software was no longer upgradable,\" Caluori explains. \"The immediate benefits of moving to public cloud were clear: reduced infrastructure burden and access to standard processes refined by SAP. They&#x27;ve been in this business for 40 to 50 years, and they put all their experience into this one solution. Now upgrades just work.\"But the most significant advantage proved to be the clean core philosophy inherent in public cloud deployments, which means the software is maintained and upgraded by SAP. This approach, combined with robust API connectivity, created an environment where Western Sugar&#x27;s IT department could easily integrate systems. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, this model keeps core ERP logic standardized and upgradeable, while extensions and integrations are handled through SAP-supported APIs and services.\"In the end, we have lower total cost of ownership, a better product, and the data quality and process discipline that&#x27;s essential for AI adoption,\" Caluori says.This clean core foundation — standardized, continuously updated, and API-connected — is what makes embedded AI viable inside SAP Cloud ERP.How clean core processes in SAP enabled AI automationWhen SAP began rolling out SAP Business AI capabilities inside SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, Caluori was amped to improve processes through automation and standardization in ways they&#x27;d never previously imagined. The company&#x27;s first major AI implementation focused on central invoice management. Today, invoices arrive from external sources and pass through the firewall. If they meet predefined AI confidence thresholds, SAP Business AI automatically posts them with zero human keyboard input. Each transaction is continuously evaluated using a traffic-light model: green items are processed automatically, yellow items are routed for review, and red items are flagged for immediate attention.\"Because the invoice just flows through the system automatically, we&#x27;re held to a high standard,\" he says. \"The AI-driven functionality only works if the whole process chain, from purchasing requisition to purchase order to receiving to issuing is clean, so we&#x27;re constantly improving those upstream processes to meet the demands of our AI innovations.\"Quantifying the operational impact of AI automationCaluori estimates Western Sugar has achieved six-figure direct cost savings through AI automation, not accounting for improved visibility and control. \"When I log into my computer now, I can see immediately in real time what&#x27;s going on across the procurement side,\" he says. \"I have a comprehensive cockpit view that I didn&#x27;t have before. Because I have much more visibility, I have much more control over operations.\"The company is now expanding AI adoption into new areas. With Western Sugar&#x27;s recent transition to SAP&#x27;s three-speed landscape, Caluori is targeting month-end closing processes for AI automation. \"My goal is that AI handles the vast majority of the month-end close,\" he says. \"Over time, as AI learns what we&#x27;re doing and how we close the books, the goal is to automate over 50 percent of the month&#x27;s end closing activities. We&#x27;re also looking forward to AI-managed procurement networks, and proactive reporting and intelligence, all of which will soon be possible.\"Western Sugar is also developing predictive maintenance AI for its manufacturing equipment — a critical capability for its large-scale facilities, where equipment failures can halt production and lead to losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. These efforts build on SAP’s AI and analytics capabilities across asset management and manufacturing systems.\"We&#x27;ve started an internal team working on predictive analytics with AI, where the system can tell us in advance if we need to be on alert for specific equipment — that a particular machine could break down in the next two or three days or weeks,\" Caluori explains. \"If we can proactively address these issues before they cause production stoppages, this will save us millions of dollars.\"Managing organizational change alongside AI adoptionWhile the technology itself has delivered clear benefits, the organizational impact has been more complex. For Western Sugar, modernizing its core systems early — by moving to SAP’s cloud and embracing standardized, upgrade-driven processes — required not just new workflows, but a fundamental shift in how employees thought about change itself.For Caluori, that readiness is non-negotiable. “Change management is the number-one key to success,” he says. “We had to do a lot of change management, not only around business processes, but around employee behavior as well.”That work paid off over time, in part because cloud adoption normalized continuous change. As upgrades became routine rather than disruptive, employees grew more comfortable with evolution as an operating condition.“Now, when SAP comes with a new upgrade, they know change is coming,” Caluori explains. “The mindset has shifted to being eager to see what improvements the next update will bring.” And that cultural shift has proven critical as Western Sugar moves beyond system upgrades and into more advanced initiatives.“Now people are even eager to move into AI — the bigger projects,” he adds. However, that cultural readiness must be driven from the top. At Western Sugar, executive leadership — many of whom came from large international organizations — understands the competitive necessity of staying current with technology. That top-down commitment has helped normalize continuous change and created the foundation required to pursue AI strategically.Lessons in AI readiness from Western SugarFor companies considering their own AI journeys, Western Sugar&#x27;s experience offers a clear lesson: AI readiness begins long before AI adoption. The clean core, standardized processes, and strong data quality that Western Sugar established a decade ago, driven purely by the need to escape technical debt, proved to be exactly what AI required. And while Caluori acknowledges the advantage an early start gave them, he says the second-best time to start is now.\"You have to embrace these changes, otherwise you&#x27;re left behind,\" Caluori says. \"That continuous improvement is what SAP provides us, and now with AI capabilities integrated throughout, we&#x27;re seeing benefits we couldn&#x27;t have imagined when we started this journey.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "Meta has started blocking links to ICE List, a website that compiles information about incidents involving Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents, and lists thousands of their employees' names. It seems that the latter detail is what caused Meta to take action in a move that was first reported by Wired. ICE List is a crowdsourced Wiki that describes itself as \"an independently maintained public documentation project focused on immigration-enforcement activity\" in the US. \"Its purpose is to record, organize, and preserve verifiable information about enforcement actions, agents, facilities, vehicles, and related incidents that would otherwise remain fragmented, difficult to access, or undocumented,\" its website states.Along with notable incidents, the website also lists the names of individual agents associated with ICE, CBP and other DHS agencies. According to Wired, the website's creators said much of that information had come from a \"leak,\" though it appears to be based largely on public LinkedIn profiles. As Wired notes:The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.Links to ICE List have been spreading widely for several weeks, including on Meta's platforms. There are numerous links to the website on Threads, some of which go back several weeks. Now though, clicking on previously-shared links instead results in a message that the link can't be opened. Users who try to share new links on Threads or Facebook also see error messages. \"Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can't be edited,\" the notice says. When reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to the company's privacy policy barring the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The company didn't address why it chose to start blocking the website after several weeks, or whether it considers public LinkedIn profiles to be in violation of its rules against doxxing. It is, however, not the first time Meta has opted to remove users' posts tracking information about ICE actions. The social network previously took down a Facebook group that tracked ICE sightings in Chicago after pressure from the Justice Department. Have a tip for Karissa?

Users who try to share new links on Threads or Facebook also see error messages. \"Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can't be edited,\" the notice says. When reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to the company's privacy policy barring the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The company didn't address why it chose to start blocking the website after several weeks, or whether it considers public LinkedIn profiles to be in violation of its rules against doxxing. It is, however, not the first time Meta has opted to remove users' posts tracking information about ICE actions. The social network previously took down a Facebook group that tracked ICE sightings in Chicago after pressure from the Justice Department. Have a tip for Karissa?

          "standfirst": "OpenAI is releasing a new app called Prism today, and it hopes it does for science what coding agents like Claude Code and its own Codex platform have done for programming. Prism builds on Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company is announcing it acquired today. For the uninitiated, LaTeX is a typesetting system for formatting scientific documents and journals. Nearly the entire scientific community relies on LaTeX, but it can make some tasks, such as drawing diagrams through TikZ commands, time-consuming to do. Beyond that, LaTeX is just one of the software tools a scientist might turn to when preparing to publish their research. That's where Prism comes into the picture. Like Crixet before it, the app offers robust LaTeX editing and a built-in AI assistant. Where previously it was Crixet's own Chirp agent, now it's GPT-5.2 Thinking. OpenAI's model can help with more than just formatting journals — in a press demo, an OpenAI employee used it to find and incorporate scientific literature that was relevant to the paper they were working on, with GPT-5.2 automating the process of writing the bibliography. \"None of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct, but it can certainly speed up the process,\" said Kevin Weil, vice president of science for OpenAI, when asked during the demo the possibility of ChatGPT generating fake citations. \"We're conscious that, as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality and trust in the scientific community,\" he later added. \"Our view is that the right response is not to keep AI at arm's length or let it operate invisibly in the background; it's to integrate it directly into scientific workflows in ways that preserve accountability and keep researchers in control.\" Later in the same demo, the OpenAI employee used Prism to generate a lesson plan for a graduate course on general relativity, as well as a set of problems for students to solve. OpenAI envisions these features helping scientists and professors spend less time on the more tedious tasks in their professions. Prism is available to anyone with a personal ChatGPT account. It includes support for unlimited projects and collaborators. OpenAI plans to bring the software to organizations on ChatGPT Business, Team, Enterprise and Education plans soon. Crixet won’t be offered separately.

          "content": "OpenAI is releasing a new app called Prism today, and it hopes it does for science what coding agents like Claude Code and its own Codex platform have done for programming. Prism builds on Crixet, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company is announcing it acquired today. For the uninitiated, LaTeX is a typesetting system for formatting scientific documents and journals. Nearly the entire scientific community relies on LaTeX, but it can make some tasks, such as drawing diagrams through TikZ commands, time-consuming to do.

          "standfirst": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company is expected to host its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year in February to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup.Engadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for an official invite, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.Galaxy S26, S26+ and S26 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photoPhoto by Sam Rutherford/EngadgetSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.I have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025One notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.The difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.Galaxy Buds 4Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.EngadgetSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.Support for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.Galaxy Z TrifoldYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.Galaxy S26 EdgeAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.Instead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.Bixby and other AI featuresSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.The company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.Update, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-we-think-the-company-will-unveil-130000218.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "In the race to bring artificial intelligence into the enterprise, a small but well-funded startup is making a bold claim: The problem holding back AI adoption in complex industries has never been the models themselves.Contextual AI, a two-and-a-half-year-old company backed by investors including Bezos Expeditions and Bain Capital Ventures, on Monday unveiled Agent Composer, a platform designed to help engineers in aerospace, semiconductor manufacturing, and other technically demanding fields build AI agents that can automate the kind of knowledge-intensive work that has long resisted automation.The announcement arrives at a pivotal moment for enterprise AI. Four years after ChatGPT ignited a frenzy of corporate AI initiatives, many organizations remain stuck in pilot programs, struggling to move experimental projects into full-scale production. Chief financial officers and business unit leaders are growing impatient with internal efforts that have consumed millions of dollars but delivered limited returns.Douwe Kiela, Contextual AI&#x27;s chief executive, believes the industry has been focused on the wrong bottleneck. \"The model is almost commoditized at this point,\" Kiela said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The bottleneck is context — can the AI actually access your proprietary docs, specs, and institutional knowledge? That&#x27;s the problem we solve.\"Why enterprise AI keeps failing, and what retrieval-augmented generation was supposed to fixTo understand what Contextual AI is attempting, it helps to understand a concept that has become central to modern AI development: retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG.When large language models like those from OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic generate responses, they draw on knowledge embedded during training. But that knowledge has a cutoff date, and it cannot include the proprietary documents, engineering specifications, and institutional knowledge that make up the lifeblood of most enterprises.RAG systems attempt to solve this by retrieving relevant documents from a company&#x27;s own databases and feeding them to the model alongside the user&#x27;s question. The model can then ground its response in actual company data rather than relying solely on its training.Kiela helped pioneer this approach during his time as a research scientist at Facebook AI Research and later as head of research at Hugging Face, the influential open-source AI company. He holds a Ph.D. from Cambridge and serves as an adjunct professor in symbolic systems at Stanford University.But early RAG systems, Kiela acknowledges, were crude.\"Early RAG was pretty crude — grab an off-the-shelf retriever, connect it to a generator, hope for the best,\" he said. \"Errors compounded through the pipeline. Hallucinations were common because the generator wasn&#x27;t trained to stay grounded.\"When Kiela founded Contextual AI in June 2023, he set out to solve these problems systematically. The company developed what it calls a \"unified context layer\" — a set of tools that sit between a company&#x27;s data and its AI models, ensuring that the right information reaches the model in the right format at the right time.The approach has earned recognition. According to a Google Cloud case study, Contextual AI achieved the highest performance on Google&#x27;s FACTS benchmark for grounded, hallucination-resistant results. The company fine-tuned Meta&#x27;s open-source Llama models on Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI platform, focusing specifically on reducing the tendency of AI systems to invent information.Inside Agent Composer, the platform that promises to turn complex engineering workflows into minutes of workAgent Composer extends Contextual AI&#x27;s existing platform with orchestration capabilities — the ability to coordinate multiple AI tools across multiple steps to complete complex workflows.The platform offers three ways to create AI agents. Users can start with pre-built agents designed for common technical workflows like root cause analysis or compliance checking. They can describe a workflow in natural language and let the system automatically generate a working agent architecture. Or they can build from scratch using a visual drag-and-drop interface that requires no coding.What distinguishes Agent Composer from competing approaches, the company says, is its hybrid architecture. Teams can combine strict, deterministic rules for high-stakes steps — compliance checks, data validation, approval gates — with dynamic reasoning for exploratory analysis.\"For highly critical workflows, users can choose completely deterministic steps to control agent behavior and avoid uncertainty,\" Kiela said.The platform also includes what the company calls \"one-click agent optimization,\" which takes user feedback and automatically adjusts agent performance. Every step of an agent&#x27;s reasoning process can be audited, and responses come with sentence-level citations showing exactly where information originated in source documents.From eight hours to 20 minutes: what early customers say about the platform&#x27;s real-world performanceContextual AI says early customers have reported significant efficiency gains, though the company acknowledges these figures come from customer self-reporting rather than independent verification.\"These come directly from customer evals, which are approximations of real-world workflows,\" Kiela said. \"The numbers are self-reported by our customers as they describe the before-and-after scenario of adopting Contextual AI.\"The claimed results are nonetheless striking. An advanced manufacturer reduced root-cause analysis from eight hours to 20 minutes by automating sensor data parsing and log correlation. A specialty chemicals company reduced product research from hours to minutes using agents that search patents and regulatory databases. A test equipment maker now generates test code in minutes instead of days.Keith Schaub, vice president of technology and strategy at Advantest, a semiconductor test equipment company, offered an endorsement. \"Contextual AI has been an important part of our AI transformation efforts,\" Schaub said. \"The technology has been rolled out to multiple teams across Advantest and select end customers, saving meaningful time across tasks ranging from test code generation to customer engineering workflows.\"The company&#x27;s other customers include Qualcomm, the semiconductor giant; ShipBob, a tech-enabled logistics provider that claims to have achieved 60 times faster issue resolution; and Nvidia, the chip maker whose graphics processors power most AI systems.The eternal enterprise dilemma: should companies build their own AI systems or buy off the shelf?Perhaps the biggest challenge Contextual AI faces is not competing products but the instinct among engineering organizations to build their own solutions.\"The biggest objection is &#x27;we&#x27;ll build it ourselves,&#x27;\" Kiela acknowledged. \"Some teams try. It sounds exciting to do, but is exceptionally hard to do this well at scale. Many of our customers started with DIY, and found themselves still debugging retrieval pipelines instead of solving actual problems 12-18 months later.\"The alternative — off-the-shelf point solutions — presents its own problems, the company argues. Such tools deploy quickly but often prove inflexible and difficult to customize for specific use cases.Agent Composer attempts to occupy a middle ground, offering a platform approach that combines pre-built components with extensive customization options. The system supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, as well as Contextual AI&#x27;s own Grounded Language Model, which was specifically trained to stay faithful to retrieved content.Pricing starts at $50 per month for self-serve usage, with custom enterprise pricing for larger deployments.\"The justification to CFOs is really about increasing productivity and getting them to production faster with their AI initiatives,\" Kiela said. \"Every technical team is struggling to hire top engineering talent, so making their existing teams more productive is a huge priority in these industries.\"The road ahead: multi-agent coordination, write actions, and the race to build compound AI systemsLooking ahead, Kiela outlined three priorities for the coming year: workflow automation with actual write actions across enterprise systems rather than just reading and analyzing; better coordination among multiple specialized agents working together; and faster specialization through automatic learning from production feedback.\"The compound effect matters here,\" he said. \"Every document you ingest, every feedback loop you close, those improvements stack up. Companies building this infrastructure now are going to be hard to catch.\"The enterprise AI market remains fiercely competitive, with offerings from major cloud providers, established software vendors, and scores of startups all chasing the same customers. Whether Contextual AI&#x27;s bet on context over models will pay off depends on whether enterprises come to share Kiela&#x27;s view that the foundation model wars matter less than the infrastructure that surrounds them.But there is a certain irony in the company&#x27;s positioning. For years, the AI industry has fixated on building ever-larger, ever-more-powerful models — pouring billions into the race for artificial general intelligence. Contextual AI is making a quieter argument: that for most real-world work, the magic isn&#x27;t in the model. It&#x27;s in knowing where to look.",

An advanced manufacturer reduced root-cause analysis from eight hours to 20 minutes by automating sensor data parsing and log correlation. A specialty chemicals company reduced product research from hours to minutes using agents that search patents and regulatory databases. A test equipment maker now generates test code in minutes instead of days.Keith Schaub, vice president of technology and strategy at Advantest, a semiconductor test equipment company, offered an endorsement. \"Contextual AI has been an important part of our AI transformation efforts,\" Schaub said. \"The technology has been rolled out to multiple teams across Advantest and select end customers, saving meaningful time across tasks ranging from test code generation to customer engineering workflows.\"The company&#x27;s other customers include Qualcomm, the semiconductor giant; ShipBob, a tech-enabled logistics provider that claims to have achieved 60 times faster issue resolution; and Nvidia, the chip maker whose graphics processors power most AI systems.The eternal enterprise dilemma: should companies build their own AI systems or buy off the shelf?Perhaps the biggest challenge Contextual AI faces is not competing products but the instinct among engineering organizations to build their own solutions.\"The biggest objection is &#x27;we&#x27;ll build it ourselves,&#x27;\" Kiela acknowledged. \"Some teams try. It sounds exciting to do, but is exceptionally hard to do this well at scale. Many of our customers started with DIY, and found themselves still debugging retrieval pipelines instead of solving actual problems 12-18 months later.\"The alternative — off-the-shelf point solutions — presents its own problems, the company argues. Such tools deploy quickly but often prove inflexible and difficult to customize for specific use cases.Agent Composer attempts to occupy a middle ground, offering a platform approach that combines pre-built components with extensive customization options. The system supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, as well as Contextual AI&#x27;s own Grounded Language Model, which was specifically trained to stay faithful to retrieved content.Pricing starts at $50 per month for self-serve usage, with custom enterprise pricing for larger deployments.\"The justification to CFOs is really about increasing productivity and getting them to production faster with their AI initiatives,\" Kiela said. \"Every technical team is struggling to hire top engineering talent, so making their existing teams more productive is a huge priority in these industries.\"The road ahead: multi-agent coordination, write actions, and the race to build compound AI systemsLooking ahead, Kiela outlined three priorities for the coming year: workflow automation with actual write actions across enterprise systems rather than just reading and analyzing; better coordination among multiple specialized agents working together; and faster specialization through automatic learning from production feedback.\"The compound effect matters here,\" he said. \"Every document you ingest, every feedback loop you close, those improvements stack up. Companies building this infrastructure now are going to be hard to catch.\"The enterprise AI market remains fiercely competitive, with offerings from major cloud providers, established software vendors, and scores of startups all chasing the same customers. Whether Contextual AI&#x27;s bet on context over models will pay off depends on whether enterprises come to share Kiela&#x27;s view that the foundation model wars matter less than the infrastructure that surrounds them.But there is a certain irony in the company&#x27;s positioning. For years, the AI industry has fixated on building ever-larger, ever-more-powerful models — pouring billions into the race for artificial general intelligence. Contextual AI is making a quieter argument: that for most real-world work, the magic isn&#x27;t in the model. It&#x27;s in knowing where to look.",

          "title": "How Moonshot's Kimi K2.5 helps AI builders spin up agent swarms easier than ever",
          "standfirst": "Chinese company Moonshot AI upgraded its open-sourced Kimi K2 model, transforming it into a coding and vision model with an architecture that supports an agent swarm orchestration. The new model, Moonshot Kimi K2.5, is a good option for enterprises that want agents that can automatically pass off actions instead of having a framework be a central decision-maker.The company characterized Kimi K2.5 as an “all-in-one model” that supports both visual and text inputs, letting users leverage the model for more visual coding projects.Moonshot did not publicly disclose K2.5’s parameter count, but the Kimi K2 model that it&#x27;s based on, had 1 trillion total parameters and 32 billion activated parameters thanks to its mixture-of-experts architecture.This is the latest open-source model to offer an alternative to the more closed options from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, and it outperforms them on key metrics including agentic workflows, coding, and vision. On the Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, Kimi K2.5 scored 50.2% (with tools), surpassing OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 (xhigh) and Claude Opus 4.5. It also achieved 76.8% on SWE-bench Verified, cementing its status as a top-tier coding model, though GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 overtake it here at 80 and 80.9, respectively. Moonshot said in a press release that it&#x27;s seen a 170% increase in users between September and November for Kimi K2 and Kimi K2 Thinking, which was released in early November. Agent swarm and built-in orchestrationMoonshot aims to leverage self-directed agents and the agent swarm paradigm built into Kimi K2.5. Agent swarm has been touted as the next frontier in enterprise AI development and agent-based systems. It has attracted significant attention in the past few months. For enterprises, this means that if they build agent ecosystems with Kimi K2.5, they can expect to scale more efficiently. But instead of scaling “up” or growing model sizes to create larger agents, it’s betting on making more agents that can essentially orchestrate themselves. Kimi K2.5 “creates and coordinates a swarm of specialized agents working in parallel.” The company compared it to a beehive where each agent performs a task while contributing to a common goal. The model learns to self-direct up to 100 sub-agents and can execute parallel workflows of up to 1,500 tool calls.“Benchmarks only tell half the story. Moonshot AI believes AGI should ultimately be evaluated by its ability to complete real-world tasks efficiently under real-world time constraints. The real metric they care about is: how much of your day did AI actually give back to you? Running in parallel substantially reduces the time needed for a complex task — tasks that required days of work now can be accomplished in minutes,” the company said.Enterprises considering their orchestration strategies have begun looking at agentic platforms where agents communicate and pass off tasks, rather than following a rigid orchestration framework that dictates when an action is completed. While Kimi K2.5 may offer a compelling option for organizations that want to use this form of orchestration, some may feel more comfortable avoiding agent-based orchestration baked into the model and instead using a different platform to differentiate the model training from the agentic task. This is because enterprises often want more flexibility in which models make up their agents, so they can build an ecosystem of agents that tap LLMs that work best for specific actions. Some agent platforms, such as Salesforce, AWS Bedrock, and IBM, offer separate observability, management, and monitoring tools that help users orchestrate AI agents built with different models and enable them to work together. Multimodal coding and visual debuggingThe model lets users code visual layouts, including user interfaces and interactions. It reasons over images and videos to understand tasks encoded in visual inputs. For example, K2.5 can reconstruct a website’s code simply by analyzing a video recording of the site in action, translating visual cues into interactive layouts and animations.“Interfaces, layouts, and interactions that are difficult to describe precisely in language can be communicated through screenshots or screen recordings, which the model can interpret and turn into fully functional websites. This enables a new class of vibe coding experiences,” Moonshot said.This capability is integrated into Kimi Code, a new terminal-based tool that works with IDEs like VSCode and Cursor. It supports \"autonomous visual debugging,\" where the model visually inspects its own output — such as a rendered web page — references documentation, and iterates on the code to fix layout shifts or aesthetic errors without human intervention.Unlike other multimodal models that can create and understand images, Kimi K2.5 can build frontend interactions for websites with visuals, not just the code behind them.API pricingMoonshot AI has aggressively priced the K2.5 API to compete with major U.S. labs, offering significant reductions compared to its previous K2 Turbo model.Input: 60 cents per million tokens (a 47.8% decrease).Cached Input: 10 cents per million tokens (a 33.3% decrease).Output: $3 per million tokens (a 62.5% decrease).The low cost of cached inputs ($0.10/M tokens) is particularly relevant for the \"Agent Swarm\" features, which often require maintaining large context windows across multiple sub-agents and extensive tool usage.Modified MIT licenseWhile Kimi K2.5 is open-sourced, it is released under a Modified MIT License that includes a specific clause targeting \"hyperscale\" commercial users.The license grants standard permissions to use, copy, modify, and sell the software. However, it stipulates that if the software or any derivative work is used for a commercial product or service that has more than 100 million monthly active users (MAU) or more than $20 million USD in monthly revenue, the entity must prominently display \"Kimi K2.5\" on the user interface. This clause ensures that while the model remains free and open for the vast majority of the developer community and startups, major tech giants cannot white-label Moonshot’s technology without providing visible attribution.It&#x27;s not full \"open source\" but it is better than Meta&#x27;s similar Llama Licensing terms for its \"open source\" family of models, which required those companies with 700 million or more monthly users to obtain a special enterprise license from the company. What it means for modern enterprise AI buildersFor the practitioners defining the modern AI stack — from LLM decision-makers optimizing deployment cycles to AI orchestration leaders setting up agents and AI-powered automated business processes — Kimi K2.5 represents a fundamental shift in leverage. By embedding swarm orchestration directly into the model, Moonshot AI effectively hands these resource-constrained builders a synthetic workforce, allowing a single engineer to direct a hundred autonomous sub-agents as easily as a single prompt. This \"scale-out\" architecture directly addresses data decision-makers&#x27; dilemma of balancing complex pipelines with limited headcount, while the slashed pricing structure transforms high-context data processing from a budget-breaking luxury into a routine commodity. Ultimately, K2.5 suggests a future where the primary constraint on an engineering team is no longer the number of hands on keyboards, but the ability of its leaders to choreograph a swarm.",

          "content": "Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google's autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like OpenAI Atlas, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don't have to. The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or \"Sidepanel\" view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it. You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it's only talking about it now.Read full article Comments",

Dominick Skinner, the creator of ICE List, tells WIRED that links to the website have been shared without issue on Meta’s platforms for more than six months. “I think it's no surprise that a company run by a man who sat behind Trump at his inauguration, and donated to the destruction of the White House, has taken a stance that helps ICE agents retain anonymity,” says Skinner.Read full article Comments",

This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel. (Spoilers for the 1954 novel below.) Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children's novel called The Coral Island, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a \"savage\" people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who \"behave the way children really would behave.\"Read full article Comments",

SpaceX's demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn't reserve \"large portions\" of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service.

The move follows Beijing's temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington cleared exports on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips. The H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip after the B200, delivers roughly six times the performance of the company's H20 chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China.

          "content": "AMD has released three distinct generations of its 3D V-Cache technology, which initially appeared in the Ryzen 7 5800X3D in 2022. The kernel of the idea has remained the same throughout AMD's efforts: take an existing desktop processor design and graft 64MB of additional L3 cache onto it. This approach disproportionately helps apps that benefit from more cache, particularly games, and the size of the boost that 3D V-Cache gives to game performance has always been enough to offset any downsides these chips have come with. In the four years since the 5800X3D was released, AMD also has steadily chipped away at those disadvantages, adding more CPU cores, improving power consumption and temperatures, and re-adding the typical Ryzen range of overclocking controls. AMD's new Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which launches for $499 starting tomorrow, is the very definition of a mild upgrade. It's the year-old Ryzen 7 9800X3D but with an extra 400 MHz of turbo boost speed. That's it. That's the chip.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "An open source AI assistant called Moltbot (formerly \"Clawdbot\") recently crossed 69,000 stars on GitHub after a month, making it one of the fastest-growing AI projects of 2026. Created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool lets users run a personal AI assistant and control it through messaging apps they already use. While some say it feels like the AI assistant of the future, running the tool as currently designed comes with serious security risks. Among the dozens of unofficial AI bot apps that never rise above the fray, Moltbot is perhaps most notable for its proactive communication with the user. The assistant works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, and other platforms. It can reach out to users with reminders, alerts, or morning briefings based on calendar events or other triggers. The project has drawn comparisons to Jarvis, the AI assistant from the Iron Man films, for its ability to actively attempt to manage tasks across a user's digital life. However, we'll tell you up front that there are plenty of drawbacks to the still-hobbyist software: While the organizing assistant code runs on a local machine, the tool effectively requires a subscription to Anthropic or OpenAI for model access (or using an API key). Users can run local AI models with the bot, but they are currently less effective at carrying out tasks than the best commercial models. Claude Opus 4.5, which is Anthropic's flagship large language model (LLM), is a popular choice.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When King Charles VIII of France occupied Naples in 1495, his army of nearly 20,000 mercenaries became the ground zero of the “Great Pox,” the first massive venereal syphilis pandemic in Europe, which went on to cause up to 5 million deaths. For a long time, the siege of Naples was considered the first time syphilis entered European accounts and culture. “But the evolutionary history of Treponema pallidum, the lineage of bacteria including the one that causes syphilis, goes way deeper in time,” says Elizabeth Nelson, an anthropologist at Southern Methodist University. Nelson and her colleagues found a 5,500-year-old Treponema pallidum genome in an individual excavated from a rock shelter in Colombia—a discovery that shows pathogens causing treponemal diseases like syphilis, bejel, or yaws are several millennia older than we thought. And this means we might have been thinking about the origins of syphilis in an entirely wrong way. The blame game While the French occupation of Naples did not introduce syphilis to the world, it created the perfect storm that shaped the perception of this disease and its origins for centuries to come. The first ingredient of this storm was the French army and its leader. Charles VIII invaded Naples with a vast melting pot of brigands and mercenaries from all over Europe, including the French, Swiss, Poles, and Spaniards. The king himself wasn’t exactly the epitome of morality. Chroniclers like Johannes Burckard noted his “fondness of copulation” and reported that, once he’d been with a woman, he “cared no more about her” and immediately sought another partner—a behavior eagerly mirrored by his soldiers.Read full article Comments",

But, of those 82, only 44 were still being regularly updated as of October 2025, with 38 (46 percent) having their updates paused without public notice or explanation. Examining the databases' content, it appeared that vaccination data was most affected by the stealth data freezes. Of the 38 outdated databases, 33 (87 percent) included data related to vaccination. In contrast, none of the 44 still-updated databases relate to vaccination. Other frozen databases included data on infectious disease burden, such as data on hospitalizations from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Read full article Comments",
