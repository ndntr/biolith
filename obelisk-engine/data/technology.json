          "standfirst": "Just a few short weeks ago, Google debuted its Gemini 3 model, claiming it scored a leadership position in multiple AI benchmarks. But the challenge with vendor-provided benchmarks is that they are just that — vendor-provided. A new vendor-neutral evaluation from Prolific, however, puts Gemini 3 at the top of the leaderboard. This isn&#x27;t on a set of academic benchmarks; rather, it&#x27;s on a set of real-world attributes that actual users and organizations care about. Prolific was founded by researchers at the University of Oxford. The company delivers high-quality, reliable human data to power rigorous research and ethical AI development. The company&#x27;s “HUMAINE benchmark” applies this approach by using representative human sampling and blind testing to rigorously compare AI models across a variety of user scenarios, measuring not just technical performance but also user trust, adaptability and communication style.The latest HUMAINE test evaluated 26,000 users in a blind test of models. In the evaluation, Gemini 3 Pro&#x27;s trust score surged from 16% to 69%, the highest ever recorded by Prolific. Gemini 3 now ranks number one overall in trust, ethics and safety 69% of the time across demographic subgroups, compared to its predecessor Gemini 2.5 Pro, which held the top spot only 16% of the time.Overall, Gemini 3 ranked first in three of four evaluation categories: performance and reasoning, interaction and adaptiveness and trust and safety. It lost only on communication style, where DeepSeek V3 topped preferences at 43%. The HUMAINE test also showed that Gemini 3 performed consistently well across 22 different demographic user groups, including variations in age, sex, ethnicity and political orientation. The evaluation also found that users are now five times more likely to choose the model in head-to-head blind comparisons.But the ranking matters less than why it won.\"It&#x27;s the consistency across a very wide range of different use cases, and a personality and a style that appeals across a wide range of different user types,\" Phelim Bradley, co-founder and CEO of Prolific, told VentureBeat. \"Although in some specific instances, other models are preferred by either small subgroups or on a particular conversation type, it&#x27;s the breadth of knowledge and the flexibility of the model across a range of different use cases and audience types that allowed it to win this particular benchmark.\"How blinded testing reveals what academic benchmarks missHUMAINE&#x27;s methodology exposes gaps in how the industry evaluates models. Users interact with two models simultaneously in multi-turn conversations. They don&#x27;t know which vendors power each response. They discuss whatever topics matter to them, not predetermined test questions.It&#x27;s the sample itself that matters. HUMAINE uses representative sampling across U.S. and UK populations, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity and political orientation. This reveals something static benchmarks can&#x27;t capture: Model performance varies by audience.\"If you take an AI leaderboard, the majority of them still could have a fairly static list,\" Bradley said. \"But for us, if you control for the audience, we end up with a slightly different leaderboard, whether you&#x27;re looking at a left-leaning sample, right-leaning sample, U.S., UK. And I think age was actually the most different stated condition in our experiment.\"For enterprises deploying AI across diverse employee populations, this matters. A model that performs well for one demographic may underperform for another.The methodology also addresses a fundamental question in AI evaluation: Why use human judges at all when AI could evaluate itself? Bradley noted that his firm does use AI judges in certain use cases, although he stressed that human evaluation is still the critical factor.\"We see the biggest benefit coming from smart orchestration of both LLM judge and human data, both have strengths and weaknesses, that, when smartly combined, do better together,\" said Bradley. \"But we still think that human data is where the alpha is. We&#x27;re still extremely bullish that human data and human intelligence is required to be in the loop.\"What trust means in AI evaluationTrust, ethics and safety measures user confidence in reliability, factual accuracy and responsible behavior. In HUMAINE&#x27;s methodology, trust isn&#x27;t a vendor claim or a technical metric — it&#x27;s what users report after blinded conversations with competing models.The 69% figure represents probability across demographic groups. This consistency matters more than aggregate scores because organizations can serve diverse populations.\"There was no awareness that they were using Gemini in this scenario,\" Bradley said. \"It was based only on the blinded multi-turn response.\"This separates perceived trust from earned trust. Users judged model outputs without knowing which vendor produced them, eliminating Google&#x27;s brand advantage. For customer-facing deployments where the AI vendor remains invisible to end users, this distinction matters.What enterprises should do nowOne of the critical things that enterprises should do now when considering different models is embrace an evaluation framework that works.\"It is increasingly challenging to evaluate models exclusively based on vibes,\" Bradley said. \"I think increasingly we need more rigorous, scientific approaches to truly understand how these models are performing.\"The HUMAINE data provides a framework: Test for consistency across use cases and user demographics, not just peak performance on specific tasks. Blind the testing to separate model quality from brand perception. Use representative samples that match your actual user population. Plan for continuous evaluation as models change.For enterprises looking to deploy AI at scale, this means moving beyond \"which model is best\" to \"which model is best for our specific use case, user demographics and required attributes.\" The rigor of representative sampling and blind testing provides the data to make that determination — something technical benchmarks and vibes-based evaluation cannot deliver.",

          "title": "The best VPN deals: Up to 88 percent off ProtonVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN, NordVPN and more",
          "standfirst": "With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Most VPNs now have their Black Friday deals live, and you can save anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions to the best VPNs. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but committing is not a bad idea — while you pay more at the start, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This Cyber Monday deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents an 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. It's rare to see ExpressVPN doing anything for Cyber Monday, so give this deal some serious thought. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This early Black Friday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months. NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another early Black Friday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "Nikon ZR review: A highly capable cinema camera at a reasonable price",
          "standfirst": "Video used to be an afterthought for Nikon, but since the company purchased RED last year, content creators are now high on its priority list. A perfect example of that is Nikon’s new $2,200 ZR: a full-frame mirrorless model that stands up against dedicated cinema cameras for a fraction of the price. It’s the first consumer camera to capture video using RED’s 12-bit RAW format, but unlike RED’s Hollywood cameras, it has a fast and accurate autofocus system. It also comes with a huge display, pro video monitoring tools, in-body stabilization and 32-bit float internal audio recording. After shooting a short film that tested its capabilities, I can confirm that the Nikon ZR offers incredible video quality at this price. Body and handling While a bit lighter than Nikon’s Z6 III, the 1.19-pound (540-gram) ZR feels solid. It has a boxy design like Sony’s FX2 but a much smaller grip because it’s designed to be rigged up for cinema shooting with cages and handles. However, unlike the FX2 which has multiple 1/4-inch mounting threads to do such rigging, the ZR unfortunately has only one of those on the bottom. The ZR also lacks an electronic viewfinder like the FX2, but it more than makes up for that with its huge 4-inch display — the largest I’ve ever seen on a mirrorless camera. At 1,000 nits, it’s bright enough to shoot on sunny days, extremely sharp (3.07 million dots) and flips out for vloggers. All of that makes it a perfect primary display for checking the image and controlling the camera. Nikon has nailed the ZR’s handling, too. While it’s not covered with buttons and dials like some models, it does have two shooting dials to control exposure and a joystick for autofocus. There’s also a camera/video switch, two record buttons, a power switch and five customizable buttons. Many of Nikon’s lenses come with control rings as well, so extra manual control is available. The menu button is unusual: you press once for the quick menu and hold to see the full menu. Given the large number of settings, I would advise anyone buying this camera to learn all the important adjustments, then customize the controls to avoid wading through dense menus while shooting. Another unique feature is in the battery compartment. There’s a single fast CFexpress slot to handle RAW video, plus a microSD slot for proxies. The lack of a second CFexpress slot or fast SD card slot for backup isn’t ideal for a professional camera, though. Finally, the ZR runs on the same N‑EL15c batteries as other Nikon mirrorless cameras. They allow 90 minutes of HD shooting on a charge, or 390 photos per CIPA standards. That’s mediocre, so if you’re planning long shoots, stock up on batteries. Video Steve Dent for Engadget The Nikon ZR has the largest selection of RAW video settings I’ve seen. The centerpiece is RED’s RAW R3D NE light codec (designed by RED for Nikon) with RED’s Log3G10 log format. It also supports Nikon’s N-RAW, ProRes/ProRes RAW and H.265 with resolution that ranges from 6K at up to 60 fps to 4K 120 fps and 1080p at 240 fps. Despite the smallish body, it can capture 6K RAW video continuously for 125 minutes without overheating. The 24MP sensor uses a dual ISO system with native 800 and 6,400 ISOs, providing a nice range for indoor and outdoor shooting. The company claims 15+ stops of dynamic range, which is more than just about any other mirrorless camera. Other key video features include five-axis in-body stabilization with seven stops of shake reduction, waveform and vectorscope monitoring and a false color display for manual focus. To test the camera’s features and video quality, I shot a short film in a mix of indoor low light, outdoor daytime and a mix between the two. I also shot handheld (including running with it) to test the stabilization. I primarily captured in R3D RAW, as well as Nikon’s N-RAW at the native 800 and 6,400 ISOs to maximize dynamic range. (You can take 24MP photos with this camera, but I’m focusing on video as it’s mainly designed for that.) In order to not see a flat log profile when shooting, you’ll need to apply a look-up table (LUT) designed for RED cameras, like \"Achromic,\" \"Bleach\" or \"Caustic.\" Those are only for in-camera previews and not baked into the video, but you can apply those LUTs later in Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve to get the same look. Steve Dent for Engadget With such a high native ISO, I was able to shoot inside with a single studio light. Video quality was outstanding with little noise in shadow regions, even after boosting black levels in post. Meanwhile, the RED R3D codec and Log3G10 gave me extra latitude to reveal shadow detail and dial down highlights when I shot the subject against a bright window. When you use the R3D codec, exposure is strictly manual with no ability to set auto shutter speed (shutter angle) or f-stop. So, for a scene with varying light, I used Nikon’s N-RAW to see if it would give me the correct exposure at the beginning and end of the scene. It did a good job, with no noticeable jumps during the shot. Video in sunlight at ISO 800 was also sharp with accurate colors after downscaling to 4K from 6K in DaVinci Resolve. ISO 800 is a relatively high native setting, though, and the ZR doesn’t have a built-in ND filter to reduce exposure. That means you’ll need to buy ND filters for outside shooting or the high shutter speeds will result in choppy video. Cinema cameras from Blackmagic Design, Arri or RED are manual-focus only. But the ZR is a Nikon camera, and it has the best AF system I’ve seen on any of the company’s models, consistently nailing focus even with moving subjects. You can also automatically track vehicles, birds and other animals. At the same time, the ZR handles manual focus well. That’s thanks to a built-in display that’s big enough to check focus accurately and Nikon’s focus peaking setting with three levels of sensitivity. Steve Dent for Engadget In-body stabilization on the ZR wasn’t up to par with Panasonic’s S1 II, however. Video was smooth for handheld shooting if I panned the camera gently, but all my running and walking shots showed noticeable camera shake. That said, the ZR at least has in-body stabilization, unlike most cinema cameras, and most filmmakers will use a gimbal for running shots, regardless of which camera they use. (Note that the rattling you hear when the ZR is turned off is the sensor, which floats by design.) Finally, I was able to capture good audio quality via an external microphone without any clipping worries thanks to the Nikon ZR’s 32-bit float internal audio capture. The company also touts directional capture using its built-in mics, but as with any such system, audio quality isn’t high enough for production use. Wrap-up With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation. Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises. Video quality and ease of use even beats models that are double or triple the price. The ZR’s primary competition is in the low-end cinema cameras, particularly Sony’s $2,998 FX2 and the $3,899 Canon R5C. While more expensive, both come with an electronic viewfinder that the ZR lacks, and the R5C can shoot up to 8K video. Another option is Blackmagic Design’s Pyxis 6K camera, but it only offers basic autofocus capabilities and lacks in-body stabilization. Compared to those options, Nikon’s ZR delivers better dynamic range thanks to the inclusion of RED’s R3D RAW codec. It also comes with an excellent autofocus system and decent in-body stabilization. If you’re a creator looking to get the best video quality for the money without losing those niceties, I’d highly recommend the ZR.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-zr-review-a-highly-capable-cinema-camera-at-a-reasonable-price-152634311.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Video used to be an afterthought for Nikon, but since the company purchased RED last year, content creators are now high on its priority list. A perfect example of that is Nikon’s new $2,200 ZR: a full-frame mirrorless model that stands up against dedicated cinema cameras for a fraction of the price. It’s the first consumer camera to capture video using RED’s 12-bit RAW format, but unlike RED’s Hollywood cameras, it has a fast and accurate autofocus system. It also comes with a huge display, pro video monitoring tools, in-body stabilization and 32-bit float internal audio recording. After shooting a short film that tested its capabilities, I can confirm that the Nikon ZR offers incredible video quality at this price. Body and handling While a bit lighter than Nikon’s Z6 III, the 1.19-pound (540-gram) ZR feels solid. It has a boxy design like Sony’s FX2 but a much smaller grip because it’s designed to be rigged up for cinema shooting with cages and handles. However, unlike the FX2 which has multiple 1/4-inch mounting threads to do such rigging, the ZR unfortunately has only one of those on the bottom. The ZR also lacks an electronic viewfinder like the FX2, but it more than makes up for that with its huge 4-inch display — the largest I’ve ever seen on a mirrorless camera. At 1,000 nits, it’s bright enough to shoot on sunny days, extremely sharp (3.07 million dots) and flips out for vloggers. All of that makes it a perfect primary display for checking the image and controlling the camera. Nikon has nailed the ZR’s handling, too. While it’s not covered with buttons and dials like some models, it does have two shooting dials to control exposure and a joystick for autofocus. There’s also a camera/video switch, two record buttons, a power switch and five customizable buttons. Many of Nikon’s lenses come with control rings as well, so extra manual control is available. The menu button is unusual: you press once for the quick menu and hold to see the full menu. Given the large number of settings, I would advise anyone buying this camera to learn all the important adjustments, then customize the controls to avoid wading through dense menus while shooting. Another unique feature is in the battery compartment. There’s a single fast CFexpress slot to handle RAW video, plus a microSD slot for proxies. The lack of a second CFexpress slot or fast SD card slot for backup isn’t ideal for a professional camera, though. Finally, the ZR runs on the same N‑EL15c batteries as other Nikon mirrorless cameras. They allow 90 minutes of HD shooting on a charge, or 390 photos per CIPA standards. That’s mediocre, so if you’re planning long shoots, stock up on batteries. Video Steve Dent for Engadget The Nikon ZR has the largest selection of RAW video settings I’ve seen. The centerpiece is RED’s RAW R3D NE light codec (designed by RED for Nikon) with RED’s Log3G10 log format. It also supports Nikon’s N-RAW, ProRes/ProRes RAW and H.265 with resolution that ranges from 6K at up to 60 fps to 4K 120 fps and 1080p at 240 fps. Despite the smallish body, it can capture 6K RAW video continuously for 125 minutes without overheating. The 24MP sensor uses a dual ISO system with native 800 and 6,400 ISOs, providing a nice range for indoor and outdoor shooting. The company claims 15+ stops of dynamic range, which is more than just about any other mirrorless camera. Other key video features include five-axis in-body stabilization with seven stops of shake reduction, waveform and vectorscope monitoring and a false color display for manual focus. To test the camera’s features and video quality, I shot a short film in a mix of indoor low light, outdoor daytime and a mix between the two. I also shot handheld (including running with it) to test the stabilization. I primarily captured in R3D RAW, as well as Nikon’s N-RAW at the native 800 and 6,400 ISOs to maximize dynamic range. (You can take 24MP photos with this camera, but I’m focusing on video as it’s mainly designed for that.) In order to not see a flat log profile when shooting, you’ll need to apply a look-up table (LUT) designed for RED cameras, like \"Achromic,\" \"Bleach\" or \"Caustic.\" Those are only for in-camera previews and not baked into the video, but you can apply those LUTs later in Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve to get the same look. Steve Dent for Engadget With such a high native ISO, I was able to shoot inside with a single studio light. Video quality was outstanding with little noise in shadow regions, even after boosting black levels in post. Meanwhile, the RED R3D codec and Log3G10 gave me extra latitude to reveal shadow detail and dial down highlights when I shot the subject against a bright window. When you use the R3D codec, exposure is strictly manual with no ability to set auto shutter speed (shutter angle) or f-stop. So, for a scene with varying light, I used Nikon’s N-RAW to see if it would give me the correct exposure at the beginning and end of the scene. It did a good job, with no noticeable jumps during the shot. Video in sunlight at ISO 800 was also sharp with accurate colors after downscaling to 4K from 6K in DaVinci Resolve. ISO 800 is a relatively high native setting, though, and the ZR doesn’t have a built-in ND filter to reduce exposure. That means you’ll need to buy ND filters for outside shooting or the high shutter speeds will result in choppy video. Cinema cameras from Blackmagic Design, Arri or RED are manual-focus only. But the ZR is a Nikon camera, and it has the best AF system I’ve seen on any of the company’s models, consistently nailing focus even with moving subjects. You can also automatically track vehicles, birds and other animals. At the same time, the ZR handles manual focus well. That’s thanks to a built-in display that’s big enough to check focus accurately and Nikon’s focus peaking setting with three levels of sensitivity. Steve Dent for Engadget In-body stabilization on the ZR wasn’t up to par with Panasonic’s S1 II, however. Video was smooth for handheld shooting if I panned the camera gently, but all my running and walking shots showed noticeable camera shake. That said, the ZR at least has in-body stabilization, unlike most cinema cameras, and most filmmakers will use a gimbal for running shots, regardless of which camera they use. (Note that the rattling you hear when the ZR is turned off is the sensor, which floats by design.) Finally, I was able to capture good audio quality via an external microphone without any clipping worries thanks to the Nikon ZR’s 32-bit float internal audio capture. The company also touts directional capture using its built-in mics, but as with any such system, audio quality isn’t high enough for production use. Wrap-up With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation. Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises. Video quality and ease of use even beats models that are double or triple the price. The ZR’s primary competition is in the low-end cinema cameras, particularly Sony’s $2,998 FX2 and the $3,899 Canon R5C. While more expensive, both come with an electronic viewfinder that the ZR lacks, and the R5C can shoot up to 8K video.

          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisWhen tariff rates change overnight, companies have 48 hours to model alternatives and act before competitors secure the best options. At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprises demonstrated how they’re turning that chaos into competitive advantage — with quantifiable results that separate winners from losers.Vinmar International: Theglobal plastics and chemicals distributor created a real-time digital twin of its $3B supply chain, cutting default expedites by more than 20% and improving delivery agility across global operations.Florida Crystals: One of America&#x27;s largest cane sugar producers, the company unlocked millions in working capital and strengthened supply chain resilience by eliminating manual rework across Finance, Procurement, and Inbound Supply. AI pilots now extend gains into invoice processing, predictive maintenance, and order management.ASOS: The ecommerce fashion giant connected its end-to-end supply chain for full transparency, reducing process variation, accelerating speed-to-market, and improving customer experience at scale. The common thread here: process intelligence that bridges the gap traditional ERP systems can’t close — connecting operational dots across ERP, finance, and logistics systems when seconds matter. “The question isn’t whether disruptions will hit,” says Peter Budweiser, General Manager of Supply Chain at Celonis. “It’s whether your systems can show you what’s breaking fast enough to fix it.”That visibility gap costs the average company double-digit millions in working capital and competitive positioning. As 54% of supply chain leaders face disruptions daily, the pressure is shifting to AI agents that execute real actions: triggering purchase orders, rerouting shipments, adjusting inventory. But an autonomous agent acting on stale or siloed data can make million-dollar mistakes when tariff structures shift overnight. Tariffs, as old as trade itself, have become the ultimate stress test for enterprise AI — revealing whether companies truly understand their supply chains and whether their AI can be trusted to act.Modern ERP: Data rich, insight poorSupply chain leaders face a paradox: drowning in data while starving for insight. Traditional enterprise systems — SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft — capture every transaction meticulously. SAP logs the purchase order. Oracle tracks the shipment. The warehouse system records inventory movement. Each performs its function, but when tariffs change and companies need to model alternative sourcing scenarios across all three simultaneously, the data sits in silos.“What’s changed is the speed at which disruptions cascade,” says Manik Sharma, Head of Supply Chain GTM AI at Celonis. “Traditional ERP systems weren’t built for today’s volatility.”Companies generate thousands of reports showing what happened last quarter. They struggle to answer what happens if tariffs increase 25% tomorrow and need to switch suppliers within days.Tariffs: The 48-hour scrambleGlobal trade volatility has transformed tariffs from predictable costs into strategic weapons. When new rates drop with unprecedented frequency, input costs spike across suppliers, finance teams scramble to calculate margin impact, and procurement races to identify alternatives buried in disconnected systems where no one knows if switching suppliers delays shipments or violates contracts.By hour 48, competitors who already modeled scenarios execute supplier switches while late movers face capacity constraints and premium pricing. Process intelligence changes that dynamic by allowing businesses to continuously model “what-if” scenarios, showing leaders how tariff changes cascade through suppliers, contracts, production lines, warehouses, and customers. When rates hit, companies can move within hours instead of days.No AI without PI: Why process intelligence is non-negotiable for supply chainsAI and supply chains are mutually dependent: AI needs operational context, and supply chains need AI to keep pace with volatility. But here&#x27;s the truth — there is no AI without PI. Without process intelligence, AI agents operate blindly.The ongoing SAP migration wave illustrates why. An estimated 85–90% of SAP customers are still moving from ECC to S/4HANA. Moving to newer databases doesn’t solve supply chain visibility — it provides faster access to the same fragmented data.Kerry Brown, a transformation evangelist at Celonis, sees this across industries. “Organizations are shifting from PeopleSoft to Oracle, or EBS to Fusion. The bulk is in SAP,” she explains. “But what they really need isn’t a new ERP. They need to understand how work actually flows across systems they already have.”That requires end-to-end operational context. Process intelligence provides this by enabling companies to extract and connect event data across systems, showing how processes execute in real time.This distinction becomes critical when deploying autonomous agents. When visibility is fragmented, autonomous agents can easily make decisions that appear rational locally but create downstream disruption. With real-time context, AI can operate with clarity and precision, and supply chains can stay ahead of tariff-driven disruption.Digital Twins: Powering real-time responseThe companies highlighted at Celosphere all applied the same principle: understand how processes run across systems in real time. Celonis PI creates a digital twin above existing systems, using its Process Intelligence Graph to link orders, shipments, invoices, and payments end-to-end. Dependencies that traditional integrations miss become visible. A delay in SAP instantly reveals its impact across Oracle, warehouse scheduling, and customer delivery commitments.“The platform brings together process data spanning systems and departments, enriched with business context that powers AI agents to transform operations effectively,” says Daniel Brown, Chief Product Officer at Celonis. With this cross-system awareness, Celonis coordinates actions across complex workflows involving AI agents, humans, and automations — especially critical when tariffs force rapid decisions about suppliers, shipments, and customers.Zero-copy integration enables instant modelingA key advancement unveiled at Celosphere — zero-copy integration with Databricks — removes another barrier. Traditionally, analyzing supply chain data meant copying from source systems into central warehouses, creating data latency.Celonis Data Core now integrates directly with platforms like Databricks and Microsoft Fabric, querying billions of records in near real time without duplication. When trade policy shifts, companies model alternatives instantly, not after overnight data refresh cycles.Enhanced Task Mining extends this by connecting desktop activity — keystrokes, mouse clicks, screen scrolls — to business processes. This exposes manual work invisible to system logs: spreadsheet gymnastics, email negotiations, phone calls that keep supply chains moving during urgent changes.Competitive advantage in volatile marketsMost companies can’t rip out and replace systems running critical operations — nor should they. Process intelligence offers a different path: compose workflows from existing systems, deploy AI where it creates value, and adapt continuously as conditions change. This “Free the Process” movement liberates companies from rigid architectures without forcing wholesale replacement.As global trade volatility intensifies, the companies that model will move faster, make smarter decisions, and turn tariff chaos into competitive advantage — all while existing ERPs keep running.When the next wave of tariffs hits — and it will — companies won’t have days to respond. They’ll have hours. The question isn’t whether your ERP captures the data. It’s whether your systems connect the dots fast enough to matter.Missed Celosphere 2025?

          "standfirst": "Presented by IndeedAs AI continues to reshape how we work, organizations are rethinking what skills they need, how they hire, and how they retain talent. According to Indeed’s 2025 Tech Talent report, tech job postings are still down more than 30% from pre-pandemic highs, yet demand for AI expertise has never been greater. New roles are emerging almost overnight, from prompt engineers to AI operations managers, and leaders are under growing pressure to close skill gaps while supporting their teams through change. Shibani Ahuja, SVP of enterprise IT strategy at Salesforce; Matt Candy, global managing partner of generative AI strategy and transformation at IBM; and Jessica Hardeman, global head of attraction and engagement at Indeed came together for a recent roundtable conversation about the future of tech talent strategy, from hiring and reskilling to how it&#x27;s reshaping the workforce.Strategies for sourcing talentTo find the right candidates, organizations need to be certain their communication is clear from the get-go, and that means beginning with a well-thought-out job description, Hardeman said. \"How clearly are you outlining the skills that are actually required for the role, versus using very high-level or ambiguous language,\" she said. \"Something that I also highly recommend is skill-cluster sourcing. We use that to identify candidates that might be adjacent to these harder-to-find niche skills. That’s something we can upskill people into. For example, skills that are in distributed computing or machine learning frameworks also share other high-value capabilities. Using these clusters can help recruiters identify candidates that may not have that exact skill set you’re looking for, but can quickly upskill into it.\"Recruiters should also be upskilled, able to spot that potential in candidates. And once they&#x27;re hired, companies have to be intentional about how they’re growing talent from the day they step in the door. \"What that means in the near term is focusing on the mentorship, embedding that AI fluency into their onboarding experience, into their growth, into their development,\" she said. \"That means offering upskilling that teaches not just the tools they’ll need, but how to think with those tools and alongside those. The new early career sweet spot is where technical skills meet our human strengths. Curiosity. Communication. Data judgment. Workflow design. Those are the things that AI cannot replicate or replace. We have to create mentorship and sponsorship opportunities. Well-being and culture are critical components to ensuring that we’re creating good places for that early-in-career talent to land.\"How work will evolve along AIAs AI becomes embedded into daily technical work, organizations are rethinking what it means to be a developer, designer, or engineer. Instead of automating roles end to end, companies are increasingly building AI agents that act as teammates, supporting workers across the entire software development lifecycle.Candy explained that IBM is already seeing this shift in action through its Consulting Advantage platform, which serves as a unified AI experience layer for consultants and technical teams.“This is a platform that every one of our consultants works with,” he said. “It’s supported by every piece of AI technology and model out there. It’s the place where our consultants can access thousands of agents that help them in each job role and activity they’re doing.”These aren’t just prebuilt tools — teams can create and publish their own agents into an internal marketplace. That has sparked a systematic effort to map every task across traditional tech roles and build agents to enhance them.“If I think about your traditional designer, DevOps engineer, AI Ops engineer — what are all the different agents that are supporting them in those activities?” Candy said. “It’s far more than just coding. Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot accelerate coding, but that’s only one part of delivering software end to end. We’re building agents to support people at every stage of that journey.”Candy said this shift leads toward a workplace where AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, something that enables tech workers to spend more time on creative, strategic, and human-centered tasks.\"This future where employees have agents working alongside them, taking care of some of these repetitive activities, focusing on higher-value strategic work where human skills are innately important, I think becomes right at the heart of that,” he explained. “You have to unleash the organization to be able to think and rethink in that way.\"A lot of that depends on the mindset of company leaders, Ahuja said. \"I can see the difference between leaders that look at AI as cost-cutting, reduction — it’s a bottom-line activity,” she said. “And then there are organizations that are starting to shift their mindset to say, no, the goal is not about replacing people. It’s about reimagining the work to make us humans more human, ironically. For some leaders that’s the story their PR teams have told them to say. But for those that actually believe that AI is about helping us become more human, it’s interesting how they’re bringing that to life and bridging this gap between humanity and digital labor.\" Shifting the culture toward AIThe companies that are most successful at navigating the obstacles around successful AI implementation and culture change make employees their first priority, Ahuja added. They prioritize use cases that solve the most boring problems that are burdening their teams, demonstrating how AI will help, as opposed to looking at what the maximum number of jobs automation can replace.\"They’re thinking of it as preserving human accountability, so in high-stakes moments, people will still make that final call,\" she said. \"Looking at where AI is going to excel at scale and speed with pattern recognition, leaving that space for humans to bring their judgement, their ethics, and their emotional intelligence. It seems like a very subtle shift, but it’s pretty big in terms of where it starts at the beginning of an organization and how it trickles down.\"It&#x27;s also important to build a level of comfort in using AI in employees’ day-to-day work. Salesforce created a Slack chat called Bite-Sized AI in which they encourage every colleague, including company leaders, to talk about where they&#x27;re using AI and why, and what hacks they&#x27;ve found. \"That’s creating a safe space,\" Ahuja explained. \"It’s creating that psychological safety — that this isn’t just a buzzword. We’re trying to encourage it through behavior.\"\"This is all about how you ignite, especially in big enterprises, the kind of passion and fire inside everyone’s belly,\" Candy added. \"Storytelling, showing examples of what great looks like. The expression is &#x27;demos, not memos&#x27;. Stop writing PowerPoint slides explaining what we&#x27;re going to do and actually getting into the tools to show it in real life.”AI makes that continuous learning a non-negotiable, Hardeman added, with companies training employees in understanding how to use the AI tools they&#x27;re provided, and that goes a long way toward building that AI culture. \"We view upskilling as a retention lever and a performance driver,\" she said. \"It creates that confidence, it reduces the fear around AI adoption. It helps people see a future for themselves as the technology evolves. AI didn’t just raise the bar on skills. It raised the bar on how we’re trying to support our people. It’s important that we are also rising to that occasion, and we’re not just raising expectations on the folks that we work with.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Well-being and culture are critical components to ensuring that we’re creating good places for that early-in-career talent to land.\"How work will evolve along AIAs AI becomes embedded into daily technical work, organizations are rethinking what it means to be a developer, designer, or engineer. Instead of automating roles end to end, companies are increasingly building AI agents that act as teammates, supporting workers across the entire software development lifecycle.Candy explained that IBM is already seeing this shift in action through its Consulting Advantage platform, which serves as a unified AI experience layer for consultants and technical teams.“This is a platform that every one of our consultants works with,” he said. “It’s supported by every piece of AI technology and model out there. It’s the place where our consultants can access thousands of agents that help them in each job role and activity they’re doing.”These aren’t just prebuilt tools — teams can create and publish their own agents into an internal marketplace. That has sparked a systematic effort to map every task across traditional tech roles and build agents to enhance them.“If I think about your traditional designer, DevOps engineer, AI Ops engineer — what are all the different agents that are supporting them in those activities?” Candy said. “It’s far more than just coding. Tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot accelerate coding, but that’s only one part of delivering software end to end. We’re building agents to support people at every stage of that journey.”Candy said this shift leads toward a workplace where AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, something that enables tech workers to spend more time on creative, strategic, and human-centered tasks.\"This future where employees have agents working alongside them, taking care of some of these repetitive activities, focusing on higher-value strategic work where human skills are innately important, I think becomes right at the heart of that,” he explained. “You have to unleash the organization to be able to think and rethink in that way.\"A lot of that depends on the mindset of company leaders, Ahuja said. \"I can see the difference between leaders that look at AI as cost-cutting, reduction — it’s a bottom-line activity,” she said. “And then there are organizations that are starting to shift their mindset to say, no, the goal is not about replacing people. It’s about reimagining the work to make us humans more human, ironically. For some leaders that’s the story their PR teams have told them to say. But for those that actually believe that AI is about helping us become more human, it’s interesting how they’re bringing that to life and bridging this gap between humanity and digital labor.\" Shifting the culture toward AIThe companies that are most successful at navigating the obstacles around successful AI implementation and culture change make employees their first priority, Ahuja added. They prioritize use cases that solve the most boring problems that are burdening their teams, demonstrating how AI will help, as opposed to looking at what the maximum number of jobs automation can replace.\"They’re thinking of it as preserving human accountability, so in high-stakes moments, people will still make that final call,\" she said. \"Looking at where AI is going to excel at scale and speed with pattern recognition, leaving that space for humans to bring their judgement, their ethics, and their emotional intelligence. It seems like a very subtle shift, but it’s pretty big in terms of where it starts at the beginning of an organization and how it trickles down.\"It&#x27;s also important to build a level of comfort in using AI in employees’ day-to-day work. Salesforce created a Slack chat called Bite-Sized AI in which they encourage every colleague, including company leaders, to talk about where they&#x27;re using AI and why, and what hacks they&#x27;ve found. \"That’s creating a safe space,\" Ahuja explained. \"It’s creating that psychological safety — that this isn’t just a buzzword. We’re trying to encourage it through behavior.\"\"This is all about how you ignite, especially in big enterprises, the kind of passion and fire inside everyone’s belly,\" Candy added. \"Storytelling, showing examples of what great looks like. The expression is &#x27;demos, not memos&#x27;. Stop writing PowerPoint slides explaining what we&#x27;re going to do and actually getting into the tools to show it in real life.”AI makes that continuous learning a non-negotiable, Hardeman added, with companies training employees in understanding how to use the AI tools they&#x27;re provided, and that goes a long way toward building that AI culture. \"We view upskilling as a retention lever and a performance driver,\" she said. \"It creates that confidence, it reduces the fear around AI adoption. It helps people see a future for themselves as the technology evolves. AI didn’t just raise the bar on skills. It raised the bar on how we’re trying to support our people. It’s important that we are also rising to that occasion, and we’re not just raising expectations on the folks that we work with.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "One problem enterprises face is getting employees to actually use the AI agents their dev teams have built. Google, which has already shipped many AI tools through its Workspace apps, has made Google Workspace Studio generally available to give more employees access to design, manage and share AI agents, further democratizing agentic workflows. This puts Google directly in competition with Microsoft’s Copilot and undercuts some integrations that brought OpenAI’s ChatGPT into enterprise applications. Workspace Studio is powered by Gemini 3, and while it primarily targets business teams rather than developers, it offers builders a way to offload lower-priority agent tasks. “We’ve all lost countless hours to the daily grind: Sifting through emails, juggling calendar logistics and chasing follow-up tasks,” Farhaz Karmali, product director for the Google Workspace Ecosystem, wrote in a blog post. “Legacy automation tools tried to help, but they were simply too rigid and technical for the everyday user. That’s why we’re bringing custom agents directly into Workspace with Studio — so you can delegate these repetitive tasks to agents that can reason, understand context and handle the work that used to slow you down.”The platform can bring agents to Workspace apps such as Google Docs and Sheets, as well as to third-party tools like Salesforce or Jira.More AI in applications Interest in AI agents continues to grow, and while many enterprises have begun deploying them in their workflows, they&#x27;re finding it isn’t as easy to get users on board as expected. The problem is that using agents can sometimes break employees out of their flow, so organizations have to figure out how to integrate agents where users are already fully engaged. The most common way of interacting with agents so far remains a chat screen. AWS released Quick Sight in hopes of attracting more front- and middle-office workers to use AI agents, although access to agents is still through a chatbot. OpenAI has desktop integrations that bring ChatGPT to specific apps. And, of course, Microsoft Copilot helped was ahead of this trend. Google has an advantage that only Microsoft rivals: It already offers applications that most people use. Enterprise employees use Google Workspace applications, host data and documents on Drive and send emails through Gmail. This means Google can easily get the context enterprises need to power their agents and reach millions of users. If people build agents through Workspace Studio, the platform can prove that agents targeting workplace applications, not just Google Docs, but also Microsoft Word, could be a winning strategy to increase agent adoption from employees. Templatizing agent creation Enterprise employees can choose from a template or write out what they need in a prompt window. A look around the Workspace Studio platform showed templates such as “auto-create tasks when files are added to a folder” or “create Jira issues for emails with action issues.”Karmali said Workspace Studio is being “deeply integrated with Workspace apps like Gmail, Drive and Chat,” and agents built on the platform can “understand the full context of your work.” “This allows them to provide help that matches your company’s policies and processes while generating personalized content in your tone and style,\" he said. \"You can even view your agent activity directly from the side panels of your favorite Workspace apps.\" Teams can extend agents to third-party enterprise platforms, but they can also configure custom steps to integrate with other tools.",

What has changed over the last year, however, is that vectors, the numerical representations of data used by LLMs, have increasingly become just another data type in all manner of different databases. Now, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is taking the next leap forward in the ubiquity of vectors with the general availability of Amazon S3 Vectors. Amazon S3 is the AWS cloud object storage service widely used by organizations of all sizes to store any and all types of data. More often than not, S3 is also used as a foundational component for data lake and lakehouse deployments. Amazon S3 Vectors now adds native vector storage and similarity search capabilities directly to S3 object storage. Instead of requiring a separate vector database, organizations can store vector embeddings in S3 and query them for semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications and AI agent workflows without moving data to specialized infrastructureThe service was first previewed in July with an initial capacity of 50 million vectors in a single index. With the GA release, AWS has scaled that up dramatically to 2 billion vectors in a single index and up to 20 trillion vectors per S3 storage bucket. According to AWS, customers created more than 250,000 vector indexes and ingested more than 40 billion vectors in the four months since the preview launch. The scale increase with the GA launch now allows organizations to consolidate entire vector datasets into single indexes rather than fragmenting them across infrastructure. The GA launch also shakes up the enterprise data landscape by providing a new production-ready approach for vectors that could potentially disrupt the market for purpose-built vector databases.Adding fuel to the competitive fires, AWS claims that the S3 Vector service can help organizations to \"reduce the total cost of storing and querying vectors by up to 90% when compared to specialized vector database solutions.\"AWS positions S3 Vectors as complementary, not competitive to vector databasesWhile Amazon S3 vectors provide a powerful set of vector capabilities, the answer to whether or not it replaces the need for a dedicated vector database is somewhat nuanced — and depends on who you ask.Despite the aggressive cost claims and dramatic scale improvements, AWS is positioning S3 Vectors as a complementary storage tier rather than a direct replacement for specialized vector databases.\"Customers pick whether they use S3 Vectors or a vector database based on what the application needs for latency,\" Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, VP of technology at AWS, told VentureBeat. Bukovec noted that one way to think of it is as &#x27;performance tiering&#x27; based on an organization&#x27;s application needs. She noted that if the application requires super-fast low low-latency response times, a vector database like Amazon OpenSearch is a good option.\"But for many types of operations, like creating a semantic layer of understanding on your existing data or extending agent memory with much more context, S3 Vectors is a great fit.\"The question of whether S3 and its low-cost cloud object storage will replace a database type isn&#x27;t a new one for data professionals, either. Bukovec drew an analogy to how enterprises use data lakes today. \"I expect that we will see vector storage evolve similarly to tabular data in data lakes, where customers keep on using transactional databases like Amazon Aurora for certain types of workloads and in parallel use S3 for application storage and analytics, because the performance profile works and they need the S3 traits of durability, scaleability, availability and cost economics due to data growth.\"How customer demand and requirements shaped the Amazon S3 Vector servicesOver the initial few months of preview, AWS learned what real enterprise customers really want and need from a vector data store.\"We had a lot of very positive feedback from the preview, and customers told us that they wanted the capabilities, but at a much higher scale and with lower latency, so they could use S3 as a primary vector store for much of their rapidly expanding vector storage,\" Bukovec said.In addition to the improved scale, query latency improved to approximately 100 milliseconds or less for frequent queries, with infrequent queries completing in less than one second. AWS increased maximum search results per query from 30 to 100, and write performance now supports up to 1,000 PUT transactions per second for single-vector updates.Use cases gaining traction include hybrid search, agent memory extension and semantic layer creation over existing data.Bukovec noted that one preview customer, March Networks, uses S3 Vectors for large-scale video and photo intelligence. \"The economics of vector storage and latency profile mean that March Networks can store billions of vector embeddings economically,\" she said. \"Our built-in integration with Amazon Bedrock means that it makes it easy to incorporate vector storage in generative AI and video workflows.\"Vector database vendors highlight performance gaps Specialized vector database providers are highlighting significant performance gaps between their offerings and AWS&#x27;s storage-centric approach.Purpose-built vector database providers, including Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant and Chroma, among others, have established production deployments with advanced indexing algorithms, real-time updates and purpose-built query optimization for latency-sensitive workloads.Pinecone, for one, doesn&#x27;t see Amazon S3 Vectors as being a competitive challenge to its vector database.\"Before Amazon S3 Vectors first launched, we were actually informed of the project and didn&#x27;t consider the cost-performance to be directly competitive at massive scale,\" Jeff Zhu, VP of Product at Pinecone, told VentureBeat. \"This is especially true now with our Dedicated Read Nodes, where, for example, a major e-commerce marketplace customer of ours recently benchmarked a recommendation use case with 1.4B vectors and achieved 5.7k QPS at 26ms p50 and 60ms p99.\"Analysts split on vector database futureThe launch revives the debate over whether vector search remains a standalone product category or becomes a feature that major cloud platforms commoditize through storage integration.\"It&#x27;s been clear for a while now that vector is a feature, not a product,\" Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at The Duckbill Group, wrote in a message on X (formerly Twitter) in response to a query from VentureBeat. \"Everything speaks it now; the rest will shortly.\"Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller also sees Amazon S3 Vectors as a competitive threat to standalone vector database vendors. \"It is now back to the vector vendors to make sure how they are ahead and better,\" Mueller told VentureBeat. \"Suites always win in enterprise software.\"Mueller also highlighted the advantage of AWS&#x27;s approach for eliminating data movement. He noted that vectors are the vehicle to make LLMs understand enterprise data. The real challenge is how to create vectors, which involves how data is moved and how often.

He noted that organizations using S3 for object storage can increase their use of S3 and possibly eliminate the need for dedicated vendor databases. This will increase value for S3 customers while increasing their dependence on S3 storage.Even with that growth potential for AWS, vector databases are still necessary, at least for now.\"Amazon S3 Vectors will be valuable for customers, but won&#x27;t eliminate the need for vector databases, particularly when use cases call for low latency, high-performance data services,\" Anderson told VentureBeat. AWS itself appears to embrace this complementary view while signaling continued performance improvements. \"We are just getting started on both scale and performance for S3 Vectors,\" Bukovec said. \"Just like we have improved the performance of reading and writing data into S3 for everything from video to Parquet files, we will do the same for vectors.\"What this means for enterprisesBeyond the debate over whether vector databases survive as standalone products, enterprise architects face immediate decisions about how to deploy vector storage for production AI workloads.The performance tiering framework provides a clearer decision path for enterprise architects evaluating vector storage options.S3 Vectors works for workloads tolerating 100ms latency: Semantic search over large document collections, agent memory systems, batch analytics on vector embeddings and background RAG context-retrieval.

          "standfirst": "If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show, The Voice, and Sunday Night Football. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's NBA coverage on NBC, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch the NBA without Fubo This week's nationally televised NBA on NBC matchup between the Knicks vs. Celtics is on Tuesday, Dec. 2. As an alternative, you can tune in on platforms like Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Additionally, there are several games that are available on NBC in local markets that are available on platforms like DirecTV and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's NBA games, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like the Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, Stumble, and Happy's Place. On Bravo, there are new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Southern Charm, and the season premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, on Dec. 5, too.

          "content": "If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show, The Voice, and Sunday Night Football. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's NBA coverage on NBC, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch the NBA without Fubo This week's nationally televised NBA on NBC matchup between the Knicks vs. Celtics is on Tuesday, Dec. 2. As an alternative, you can tune in on platforms like Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Additionally, there are several games that are available on NBC in local markets that are available on platforms like DirecTV and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's NBA games, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like the Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, Stumble, and Happy's Place.

          "title": "Cyber Monday speaker deals for 2025 are still available: Save up to 50 percent on Bluetooth speakers, smart speakers and soundbars",
          "standfirst": "If you've ever wanted to hear the drummer coughing on your favorite songs or the actors chewing in your favorite shows, Cyber Monday is the time to upgrade your audio. Some of the best speakers our audiophiles have ever tested are down to as low as we've seen them all year, or ever, in the case of some older models. The deals on this list range across brands, with offerings from Ultimate Ears, Bose, Beats and more, plus Sonos and Amazon Echo smart speakers and soundbars from Sony and JBL. We've been curating it all month and this is the final result — and your last chance to get ahold of most of the best deals. Some of them may last through the week, but we can't always predict which ones, so don't sleep if there's a speaker you're eyeing. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 for $29 (35 percent off): It's incredibly rare to see a full-size Bluetooth speaker selling this cheaply in 2025, especially one we'd actually recommend using. The Soundcore 2 is Anker's latest audio effort, getting you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. In short, no matter how long the adventure or where it's going, the Go 3 can probably get there with you. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Ultimate Ears Wonderbook 4 for $60 (40 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 is the little barrel that could, an adorable 1.2-pound portable bluetooth speaker that stays charged for 14 hours and keeps on playing after a five-foot drop. Outdoor Mode is a standout feature, amplifying the higher frequencies so you can hear from farther away. There's even a USB charger so your other devices can take advantage of that long battery life. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $53 (24 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Cyber Monday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. (Take note that only some colors are discounted.) Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Sony ULT Field 5 for $198 (43 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Sonos Era 100 for $200 (9 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Samsung HW-B650/ZA 3.1 Channel Soundbar for $200 (50 percent off): Samsung's mid-range soundbar is pretty simple, but it does what it needs to do: pump out Dolby 3.1 with enough volume and range to make you forget you aren't in a movie theater. It's versatile, improving both music and dialogue, and keeps everything balanced. The only real drawback is that it lacks wireless connection options other than bluetooth. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect. Bose SoundLink Max for $279 (30 percent off): The SoundLink Max, Bose's biggest speaker that isn't a soundbar, is more affordable for Cyber Monday than we've seen for a while. Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music. Marshall Acton III for $285 (5 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too). It's less portable at 6.3 pounds, but can hit high volumes with little or no distortion. The upgrade angled Acton III's tweeters outward so the soundscape is wider, making this one speaker very capable of filling a room with sound on its own. Marshall Stanmore III for $299 (21 percent off): The Stanmore III is the top-tier Marshall discount of the year, giving you the best of Marshall's 2022 redesign. It's got the same widened soundscape as the Acton III, with an additional 5Hz on the low end and an RCA input alongside its 3.5mm aux input. This retro-designed speaker also features bluetooth, pair play and a construction with 70 percent recycled plastic. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 8 for $798 (20 percent off): In our review of the Bravia 6 this year, we called out its full sound and special talent for enhancing dialogue, but were frustrated that it didn't support AirPlay or Spotify Connect. The Bravia 8 works with both services, making it a clear choice for your next premium soundbar. It's got a tight, low-footprint design that fits any aesthetic, and hits a maximum output power of 495 watts. JBL Bar 1300XMK2 for $1,200 (29 percent off): If you're going to drop $1200 on a soundbar, you need to know it's going to deliver — and the 1300XMK2 does. Its key design element is two detachable speakers that recharge when plugged into the main unit, but can spend up to 10 hours unplugged. The audioscape does an excellent job of separating and clarifying details, which really enhances the sense of a theatrical experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-speaker-deals-for-2025-are-still-available-save-up-to-50-percent-on-bluetooth-speakers-smart-speakers-and-soundbars-213017218.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Amazon Web Services on Tuesday announced a new class of artificial intelligence systems called \"frontier agents\" that can work autonomously for hours or even days without human intervention, representing one of the most ambitious attempts yet to automate the full software development lifecycle.The announcement, made during AWS CEO Matt Garman&#x27;s keynote address at the company&#x27;s annual re:Invent conference, introduces three specialized AI agents designed to act as virtual team members: Kiro autonomous agent for software development, AWS Security Agent for application security, and AWS DevOps Agent for IT operations.The move signals Amazon&#x27;s intent to leap ahead in the intensifying competition to build AI systems capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks that currently require teams of skilled engineers.\"We see frontier agents as a completely new class of agents,\" said Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, in an interview ahead of the announcement. \"They&#x27;re fundamentally designed to work for hours and days. You&#x27;re not giving them a problem that you want finished in the next five minutes. You&#x27;re giving them complex challenges that they may have to think about, try different solutions, and get to the right conclusion — and they should do that without intervention.\"Why Amazon believes its new agents leave existing AI coding tools behindThe frontier agents differ from existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Amazon&#x27;s own CodeWhisperer in several fundamental ways.Current AI coding tools, while powerful, require engineers to drive every interaction. Developers must write prompts, provide context, and manually coordinate work across different code repositories. When switching between tasks, the AI loses context and must start fresh.The new frontier agents, by contrast, maintain persistent memory across sessions and continuously learn from an organization&#x27;s codebase, documentation, and team communications. They can independently determine which code repositories require changes, work on multiple files simultaneously, and coordinate complex transformations spanning dozens of microservices.\"With a current agent, you would go microservice by microservice, making changes one at a time, and each change would be a different session with no shared context,\" Singh explained. \"With a frontier agent, you say, &#x27;I need to solve this broad problem.&#x27; You point it to the right application, and it decides which repos need changes.\"The agents exhibit three defining characteristics that AWS believes set them apart: autonomy in decision-making, the ability to scale by spawning multiple agents to work on different aspects of a problem simultaneously, and the capacity to operate independently for extended periods.\"A frontier agent can decide to spin up 10 versions of itself, all working on different parts of the problem at once,\" Singh said.How each of the three frontier agents tackles a different phase of developmentKiro autonomous agent serves as a virtual developer that maintains context across coding sessions and learns from an organization&#x27;s pull requests, code reviews, and technical discussions. Teams can connect it to GitHub, Jira, Slack, and internal documentation systems. The agent then acts like a teammate, accepting task assignments and working independently until it either completes the work or requires human guidance.AWS Security Agent embeds security expertise throughout the development process, automatically reviewing design documents and scanning pull requests against organizational security requirements. Perhaps most significantly, it transforms penetration testing from a weeks-long manual process into an on-demand capability that completes in hours.SmugMug, a photo hosting platform, has already deployed the security agent. \"AWS Security Agent helped catch a business logic bug that no existing tools would have caught, exposing information improperly,\" said Andres Ruiz, staff software engineer at the company. \"To any other tool, this would have been invisible. But the ability for Security Agent to contextualize the information, parse the API response, and find the unexpected information there represents a leap forward in automated security testing.\"AWS DevOps Agent functions as an always-on operations team member, responding instantly to incidents and using its accumulated knowledge to identify root causes. It connects to observability tools including Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk, along with runbooks and deployment pipelines.Commonwealth Bank of Australia tested the DevOps agent by replicating a complex network and identity management issue that typically requires hours for experienced engineers to diagnose. The agent identified the root cause in under 15 minutes.\"AWS DevOps Agent thinks and acts like a seasoned DevOps engineer, helping our engineers build a banking infrastructure that&#x27;s faster, more resilient, and designed to deliver better experiences for our customers,\" said Jason Sandry, head of cloud services at Commonwealth Bank.Amazon makes its case against Google and Microsoft in the AI coding warsThe announcement arrives amid a fierce battle among technology giants to dominate the emerging market for AI-powered development tools. Google has made significant noise in recent weeks with its own AI coding capabilities, while Microsoft continues to advance GitHub Copilot and its broader AI development toolkit.Singh argued that AWS holds distinct advantages rooted in the company&#x27;s 20-year history operating cloud infrastructure and Amazon&#x27;s own massive software engineering organization.\"AWS has been the cloud of choice for 20 years, so we have two decades of knowledge building and running it, and working with customers who&#x27;ve been building and running applications on it,\" Singh said. \"The learnings from operating AWS, the knowledge our customers have, the experience we&#x27;ve built using these tools ourselves every day to build real-world applications—all of that is embodied in these frontier agents.\"He drew a distinction between tools suitable for prototypes versus production systems. \"There&#x27;s a lot of things out there that you can use to build your prototype or your toy application. But if you want to build production applications, there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that apply here.\"The safeguards Amazon built to keep autonomous agents from going rogueThe prospect of AI systems operating autonomously for days raises immediate questions about what happens when they go off track. Singh described multiple safeguards built into the system.All learnings accumulated by the agents are logged and visible, allowing engineers to understand what knowledge influences the agent&#x27;s decisions. Teams can even remove specific learnings if they discover the agent has absorbed incorrect information from team communications.\"You can go in and even redact that from its knowledge like, &#x27;No, we don&#x27;t want you to ever use this knowledge,&#x27;\" Singh said. \"You can look at the knowledge like it&#x27;s almost—it&#x27;s like looking at your neurons inside your brain. You can disconnect some.\"Engineers can also monitor agent activity in real-time and intervene when necessary, either redirecting the agent or taking over entirely. Most critically, the agents never commit code directly to production systems. That responsibility remains with human engineers.\"These agents are never going to check the code into production. That is still the human&#x27;s responsibility,\" Singh emphasized. \"You are still, as an engineer, responsible for the code you&#x27;re checking in, whether it&#x27;s generated by you or by an agent working autonomously.\"What frontier agents mean for the future of software engineering jobsThe announcement inevitably raises concerns about the impact on software engineering jobs. Singh pushed back against the notion that frontier agents will replace developers, framing them instead as tools that amplify human capabilities.\"Software engineering is craft. What&#x27;s changing is not, &#x27;Hey, agents are doing all the work.&#x27; The craft of software engineering is changing—how you use agents, how do you set up your code base, how do you set up your prompts, how do you set up your rules, how do you set up your knowledge bases so that agents can be effective,\" he said.Singh noted that senior engineers who had drifted away from hands-on coding are now writing more code than ever. \"It&#x27;s actually easier for them to become software engineers,\" he said.He pointed to an internal example where a team completed a project in 78 days that would have taken 18 months using traditional practices. \"Because they were able to use AI. And the thing that made it work was not just the fact that they were using AI, but how they organized and set up their practices of how they built that software were maximized around that.\"How Amazon plans to make AI-generated code more trustworthy over timeSingh outlined several areas where frontier agents will evolve over the coming years. Multi-agent architectures, where systems of specialized agents coordinate to solve complex problems, represent a major frontier. So does the integration of formal verification techniques to increase confidence in AI-generated code.AWS recently introduced property-based testing in Kiro, which uses automated reasoning to extract testable properties from specifications and generate thousands of test scenarios automatically.\"If you have a shopping cart application, every way an order can be canceled, and how it might be canceled, and the way refunds are handled in Germany versus the US—if you&#x27;re writing a unit test, maybe two, Germany and US, but now, because you have this property-based testing approach, your agent can create a scenario for every country you operate in and test all of them automatically for you,\" Singh explained.Building trust in autonomous systems remains the central challenge. \"Right now you still require tons of human guardrails at every step to make sure that the right thing happens. And as we get better at these techniques, you will use less and less, and you&#x27;ll be able to trust the agents a lot more,\" he said.Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI stretches far beyond writing codeThe frontier agents announcement arrived alongside a cascade of other news at re:Invent 2025. AWS kicked off the conference with major announcements on agentic AI capabilities, customer service innovations, and multicloud networking.Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio with four new models delivering industry-leading price-performance across reasoning, multimodal processing, conversational AI, code generation, and agentic tasks. Nova Forge pioneers \"open training,\" giving organizations access to pre-trained model checkpoints and the ability to blend proprietary data with Amazon Nova-curated datasets.AWS also added 18 new open weight models to Amazon Bedrock, reinforcing its commitment to offering a broad selection of fully managed models from leading AI providers. The launch includes new models from Mistral AI, Google&#x27;s Gemma 3, MiniMax&#x27;s M2, NVIDIA&#x27;s Nemotron, and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT OSS Safeguard.On the infrastructure side, Amazon EC2 Trn3 UltraServers, powered by AWS&#x27;s first 3nm AI chip, pack up to 144 Trainium3 chips into a single integrated system, delivering up to 4.4x more compute performance and 4x greater energy efficiency than the previous generation. AWS AI Factories provides enterprises and government organizations with dedicated AWS AI infrastructure deployed in their own data centers, combining NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium chips, AWS networking, and AI services like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker AI.All three frontier agents launched in preview on Tuesday. Pricing will be announced when the services reach general availability.Singh made clear the company sees applications far beyond coding. \"These are the first frontier agents we are releasing, and they&#x27;re in the software development lifecycle,\" he said. \"The problems and use cases for frontier agents—these agents that are long running, capable of autonomy, thinking, always learning and improving—can be applied to many, many domains.\"Amazon, after all, operates satellite networks, runs robotics warehouses, and manages one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce platforms. If autonomous agents can learn to write code on their own, the company is betting they can eventually learn to do just about anything else.",

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday has ended; The deals party is over. But like any party, there are still a few stragglers not ready to go home just yet. This list once housed over 75 stellar Black Friday deals under $50 each. Today, we've found around 30 or so that are still within a couple bucks of their sales event low. You can get wall chargers, Roku streaming sticks, stocking-stuffer Lego sets, Bluetooth trackers and a couple of small speakers at a discount. This is still stuff Engadget has tested and recommend in our guides — yes, these are late-stage deals but the devices are still solid. Here are the best extended Cyber Monday deals you can still get for under $50. Under $50 Cyber Monday deals that you can still get Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Audible (3 months) for $3 ($42 off): As it does every sales event, Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. With the plan, you get one audiobook of your choice each month, which includes new and bestseller titles. You can also listen to an unlimited number of titles from a narrower library. A membership also grants access to a daily discounted title and other member-only discounts. With this deal, the plan will auto-renew at a dollar per month for three months, then default to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. The offer ends December 16. Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. It went as low as $33 during the sale. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Amazon: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Amazon: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Cyber Monday. This cute-as-a-button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. This is a dollar more than it sold for during the sale. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. This is two dollars more than it sold for during the sale. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $33 ($17 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). It was $3 cheaper during the sale. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. This is $2 more than it sold for during Black Friday. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $35 ($12 off) at Samsung: We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal is a few dollars more than during Cyber Monday. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off with Prime) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide.

          "content": "Cyber Monday has ended; The deals party is over. But like any party, there are still a few stragglers not ready to go home just yet. This list once housed over 75 stellar Black Friday deals under $50 each. Today, we've found around 30 or so that are still within a couple bucks of their sales event low. You can get wall chargers, Roku streaming sticks, stocking-stuffer Lego sets, Bluetooth trackers and a couple of small speakers at a discount. This is still stuff Engadget has tested and recommend in our guides — yes, these are late-stage deals but the devices are still solid. Here are the best extended Cyber Monday deals you can still get for under $50. Under $50 Cyber Monday deals that you can still get Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Audible (3 months) for $3 ($42 off): As it does every sales event, Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. With the plan, you get one audiobook of your choice each month, which includes new and bestseller titles. You can also listen to an unlimited number of titles from a narrower library. A membership also grants access to a daily discounted title and other member-only discounts. With this deal, the plan will auto-renew at a dollar per month for three months, then default to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. The offer ends December 16. Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. It went as low as $33 during the sale. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Amazon: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Amazon: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Cyber Monday. This cute-as-a-button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. This is a dollar more than it sold for during the sale. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. This is two dollars more than it sold for during the sale. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $33 ($17 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). It was $3 cheaper during the sale. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light.

UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. This is $2 more than it sold for during Black Friday. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $35 ($12 off) at Samsung: We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal is a few dollars more than during Cyber Monday. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday has come and gone, but if you’re still hoping to make a living room upgrade for the holidays, a handful of the better TV deals from the past week are still available. We’ve scoured the web and picked out the best of what's left below. The offers include a few well-reviewed OLED TVs from Samsung, Sony and LG. as well as a couple noteworthy budget models from Hisense. If you're happy with your current TV, some discounts on streaming gear are still live too. Best Cyber Monday TV deals still available Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is an entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the competing TCL QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so that model should be a better buy when the two are the same price. This set also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can reach a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($890) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a mid-tier mini-LED TV and a fairly sizable step up over the U65QG. Its main advantage over rivals like the TCL QM7K is that it can get seriously bright, which helps HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, so it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. You may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion, etc. — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. (The C5 isn't discounted right now.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal has been live for a few weeks but still matches the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds of dollars less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals still available Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of Roku's higher-end Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Walmart. Roku Ultra for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the company's streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Walmart. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Paramount says this offer will end today.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-tv-deals-that-are-still-available-include-sets-from-samsung-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-190000746.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A lot of people think Cyber Monday subscriptions are just about streaming, but that's not true. Although there are some incredible discounts to be had on the likes of Stars (Outlander and Spartacus) and Paramount+ (Yellowjackets and Star Trek), there's more to the story. We've also found great deals on exciting learning platforms like MasterClass and Rosetta Stone, cord-cutting services like DirecTV and Fubo and useful privacy services like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN. Read on to see which deals are still active. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Lower Decks, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. DirectTV (first month) for $50 (44 percent off): If you're a cord-cutter with a more general taste in TV, DirectTV is the perfect way for you to keep enjoying live channels without cable. This deal only applies for your first month, but it's great for seeing if DirectTV will work for you long-term. Better yet, any DirectTV subscription also comes with free access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Unlimited. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobook lover can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year because (true to its name) it's the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Cyber Monday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. The Wall Street Journal (one year) for $12 (90 percent off): Let's get really old-school for a moment. If you want to add some classic journalism to your diet (and you're OK with ignoring a right-leaning opinion page), one of America's \"papers of record\" is cutting annual subscription costs by 90 percent. That's enough to get you financial, US and world news all the way to the next Cyber Monday, when they'll probably do this again. Infinite money glitch! Best VPN deals for Cyber Monday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $97.72 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-you-can-still-get-big-discounts-on-starz-masterclass-headspace-and-more-174507557.html?src=rss",

This year likely more so than ever thanks to the launch of the Switch 2 back in the spring. But if you were hoping to save money on the console with Cyber Monday gaming deals still live, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Cyber Monday sale was announced a few weeks ago, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Cyber Monday deals are few and far between. However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Walmart currently have the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that on Walmart, you'll have to be signed into a Walmart account, which is free to make, and add the item to your cart to see the discounted price. There's no telling how long this deal will last. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, as well as other classics like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

          "standfirst": "The sales have officially ended. Cyber Monday and Black Friday are behind us and most deals have slipped back in to their deal caves to hibernate until the next sale event. But! There are still a few deals that haven't packed it in yet. And there are still a few discounts left on Apple gear. The standout is the new Apple Watch Series 11 that's still down to the all-time low it hit during the sales. That's $70 off and the best price on the wearable so far. The AirPods 4 without ANC are $80, which is more than the all-time low, but still nearly a $50 discount. If you still have a few Apple devices on your wish list, here are the Apple deals from Cyber Monday that still remain. Cyber Monday Apple deals still available AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $99 ($80 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,779 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Best Buy. It went as low as $1,699 during the sale. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Apple AirTag (single) for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: Still the most popular finding fob for iPhone users, the AirTag is known for its uncanny ability to find lost things by anonymously pinging nearby iPhones. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. The deal has been vacillating between $49 and $69 over the shopping holiday. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. The $95 price is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apple-cyber-monday-deals-you-can-still-get-include-discounts-on-apple-watches-and-airpods-4-182846356.html?src=rss",
          "content": "The sales have officially ended. Cyber Monday and Black Friday are behind us and most deals have slipped back in to their deal caves to hibernate until the next sale event. But! There are still a few deals that haven't packed it in yet. And there are still a few discounts left on Apple gear. The standout is the new Apple Watch Series 11 that's still down to the all-time low it hit during the sales. That's $70 off and the best price on the wearable so far. The AirPods 4 without ANC are $80, which is more than the all-time low, but still nearly a $50 discount. If you still have a few Apple devices on your wish list, here are the Apple deals from Cyber Monday that still remain. Cyber Monday Apple deals still available AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $99 ($80 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,779 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Best Buy. It went as low as $1,699 during the sale. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming.

          "standfirst": "Mistral AI, Europe&#x27;s most prominent artificial intelligence startup, is releasing its most ambitious product suite to date: a family of 10 open-source models designed to run everywhere from smartphones and autonomous drones to enterprise cloud systems, marking a major escalation in the company&#x27;s challenge to both U.S. tech giants and surging Chinese competitors.The Mistral 3 family, launching today, includes a new flagship model called Mistral Large 3 and a suite of smaller \"Ministral 3\" models optimized for edge computing applications. All models will be released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial use — a sharp contrast to the closed systems offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.The release is a pointed bet by Mistral that the future of artificial intelligence lies not in building ever-larger proprietary systems, but in offering businesses maximum flexibility to customize and deploy AI tailored to their specific needs, often using smaller models that can run without cloud connectivity.\"The gap between closed and open source is getting smaller, because more and more people are contributing to open source, which is great,\" Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s chief scientist and co-founder, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We are catching up fast.\"Why Mistral is choosing flexibility over frontier performance in the AI raceThe strategic calculus behind Mistral 3 diverges sharply from recent model releases by industry leaders. While OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have focused recent launches on increasingly capable \"agentic\" systems — AI that can autonomously execute complex multi-step tasks — Mistral is prioritizing breadth, efficiency, and what Lample calls \"distributed intelligence.\"Mistral Large 3, the flagship model, employs a Mixture of Experts architecture with 41 billion active parameters drawn from a total pool of 675 billion parameters. The model can process both text and images, handles context windows up to 256,000 tokens, and was trained with particular emphasis on non-English languages — a rarity among frontier AI systems.\"Most AI labs focus on their native language, but Mistral Large 3 was trained on a wide variety of languages, making advanced AI useful for billions who speak different native languages,\" the company said in a statement reviewed ahead of the announcement.But the more significant departure lies in the Ministral 3 lineup: nine compact models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants tailored for different use cases. Each variant serves a distinct purpose: base models for extensive customization, instruction-tuned models for general chat and task completion, and reasoning-optimized models for complex logic requiring step-by-step deliberation.The smallest Ministral 3 models can run on devices with as little as 4 gigabytes of video memory using 4-bit quantization — making frontier AI capabilities accessible on standard laptops, smartphones, and embedded systems without requiring expensive cloud infrastructure or even internet connectivity. This approach reflects Mistral&#x27;s belief that AI&#x27;s next evolution will be defined not by sheer scale, but by ubiquity: models small enough to run on drones, in vehicles, in robots, and on consumer devices.How fine-tuned small models beat expensive large models for enterprise customersLample&#x27;s comments reveal a business model fundamentally different from that of closed-source competitors. Rather than competing primarily on benchmark performance, Mistral is targeting enterprise customers frustrated by the cost and inflexibility of proprietary systems.\"Sometimes customers say, &#x27;Is there a use case where the best closed-source model isn&#x27;t working?&#x27; If that&#x27;s the case, then they&#x27;re essentially stuck,\" Lample explained. \"There&#x27;s nothing they can do. It&#x27;s the best model available, and it&#x27;s not working out of the box.\"This is where Mistral&#x27;s approach diverges. When a generic model fails, the company deploys engineering teams to work directly with customers, analyzing specific problems, creating synthetic training data, and fine-tuning smaller models to outperform larger general-purpose systems on narrow tasks.\"In more than 90% of cases, a small model can do the job, especially if it&#x27;s fine-tuned. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a model with hundreds of billions of parameters, just a 14-billion or 24-billion parameter model,\" Lample said. \"So it&#x27;s not only much cheaper, but also faster, plus you have all the benefits: you don&#x27;t need to worry about privacy, latency, reliability, and so on.\"The economic argument is compelling. Multiple enterprise customers have approached Mistral after building prototypes with expensive closed-source models, only to find deployment costs prohibitive at scale, according to Lample.\"They come back to us a couple of months later because they realize, &#x27;We built this prototype, but it&#x27;s way too slow and way too expensive,&#x27;\" he said.Where Mistral 3 fits in the increasingly crowded open-source AI marketMistral&#x27;s release comes amid fierce competition on multiple fronts. OpenAI recently released GPT-5.1 with enhanced agentic capabilities. Google launched Gemini 3 with improved multimodal understanding. Anthropic released Opus 4.5 on the same day as this interview, with similar agent-focused features.But Lample argues those comparisons miss the point. \"It&#x27;s a little bit behind. But I think what matters is that we are catching up fast,\" he acknowledged regarding performance against closed models. \"I think we are maybe playing a strategic long game.\"That long game involves a different competitive set: primarily open-source models from Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen series, which have made remarkable strides in recent months.Mistral differentiates itself through multilingual capabilities that extend far beyond English or Chinese, multimodal integration handling both text and images in a unified model, and what the company characterizes as superior customization through easier fine-tuning.\"One key difference with the models themselves is that we focused much more on multilinguality,\" Lample said. \"If you look at all the top models from [Chinese competitors], they&#x27;re all text-only. They have visual models as well, but as separate systems. We wanted to integrate everything into a single model.\"The multilingual emphasis aligns with Mistral&#x27;s broader positioning as a European AI champion focused on digital sovereignty — the principle that organizations and nations should maintain control over their AI infrastructure and data.Building beyond models: Mistral&#x27;s full-stack enterprise AI platform strategyMistral 3&#x27;s release builds on an increasingly comprehensive enterprise AI platform that extends well beyond model development. The company has assembled a full-stack offering that differentiates it from pure model providers.Recent product launches include Mistral Agents API, which combines language models with built-in connectors for code execution, web search, image generation, and persistent memory across conversations; Magistral, the company&#x27;s reasoning model designed for domain-specific, transparent, and multilingual reasoning; and Mistral Code, an AI-powered coding assistant bundling models, an in-IDE assistant, and local deployment options with enterprise tooling.The consumer-facing Le Chat assistant has been enhanced with Deep Research mode for structured research reports, voice capabilities, and Projects for organizing conversations into context-rich folders. More recently, Le Chat gained a connector directory with 20+ enterprise integrations powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), spanning tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Atlassian, Asana, and Stripe.In October, Mistral unveiled AI Studio, a production AI platform providing observability, agent runtime, and AI registry capabilities to help enterprises track output changes, monitor usage, run evaluations, and fine-tune models using proprietary data.Mistral now positions itself as a full-stack, global enterprise AI company, offering not just models but an application-building layer through AI Studio, compute infrastructure, and forward-deployed engineers to help businesses realize return on investment.Why open source AI matters for customization, transparency and sovereigntyMistral&#x27;s commitment to open-source development under permissive licenses is both an ideological stance and a competitive strategy in an AI landscape increasingly dominated by closed systems.Lample elaborated on the practical benefits: \"I think something that people don&#x27;t realize — but our customers know this very well — is how much better any model can actually improve if you fine tune it on the task of interest. There&#x27;s a huge gap between a base model and one that&#x27;s fine-tuned for a specific task, and in many cases, it outperforms the closed-source model.\"The approach enables capabilities impossible with closed systems: organizations can fine-tune models on proprietary data that never leaves their infrastructure, customize architectures for specific workflows, and maintain complete transparency into how AI systems make decisions — critical for regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and defense.This positioning has attracted government and public sector partnerships. The company launched \"AI for Citizens\" in July 2025, an initiative to \"help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services\" and has secured strategic partnerships with France&#x27;s army and job agency, Luxembourg&#x27;s government, and various European public sector organizations.Mistral&#x27;s transatlantic AI collaboration goes beyond European bordersWhile Mistral is frequently characterized as Europe&#x27;s answer to OpenAI, the company views itself as a transatlantic collaboration rather than a purely European venture. The company has teams across both continents, with co-founders spending significant time with customers and partners in the United States, and these models are being trained in partnerships with U.S.-based teams and infrastructure providers.This transatlantic positioning may prove strategically important as geopolitical tensions around AI development intensify. The recent ASML investment, a €1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) funding round led by the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, signals deepening collaboration across the Western semiconductor and AI value chain at a moment when both Europe and the United States are seeking to reduce dependence on Chinese technology.Mistral&#x27;s investor base reflects this dynamic: the Series C round included participation from U.S. firms Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Lightspeed, and Index Ventures alongside European investors like France&#x27;s state-backed Bpifrance and global players like DST Global and Nvidia.Founded in May 2023 by former Google DeepMind and Meta researchers, Mistral has raised roughly $1.05 billion (€1 billion) in funding. The company was valued at $6 billion in a June 2024 Series B, then more than doubled its valuation in a September Series C.Can customization and efficiency beat raw performance in enterprise AI?The Mistral 3 release crystallizes a fundamental question facing the AI industry: Will enterprises ultimately prioritize the absolute cutting-edge capabilities of proprietary systems, or will they choose open, customizable alternatives that offer greater control, lower costs, and independence from big tech platforms?Mistral&#x27;s answer is unambiguous. The company is betting that as AI moves from prototype to production, the factors that matter most shift dramatically. Raw benchmark scores matter less than total cost of ownership. Slight performance edges matter less than the ability to fine-tune for specific workflows. Cloud-based convenience matters less than data sovereignty and edge deployment.It&#x27;s a wager with significant risks. Despite Lample&#x27;s optimism about closing the performance gap, Mistral&#x27;s models still trail the absolute frontier. The company&#x27;s revenue, while growing, reportedly remains modest relative to its nearly $14 billion valuation. And competition intensifies from both well-funded Chinese rivals making remarkable open-source progress and U.S. tech giants increasingly offering their own smaller, more efficient models.But if Mistral is right — if the future of AI looks less like a handful of cloud-based oracles and more like millions of specialized systems running everywhere from factory floors to smartphones — then the company has positioned itself at the center of that transformation.The release of Mistral 3 is the most comprehensive expression yet of that vision: 10 models, spanning every size category, optimized for every deployment scenario, available to anyone who wants to build with them.Whether \"distributed intelligence\" becomes the industry&#x27;s dominant paradigm or remains a compelling alternative serving a narrower market will determine not just Mistral&#x27;s fate, but the broader question of who controls the AI future — and whether that future will be open.For now, the race is on. And Mistral is betting it can win not by building the biggest model, but by building everywhere else.",

The vulnerability is easy to exploit and allows hackers to execute malicious code on servers that run it. Exploit code is now publicly available. React is embedded into web apps running on servers so that remote devices render JavaScript and content more quickly and with fewer resources required. React is used by an estimated 6 percent of all websites and 39 percent of cloud environments. When end users reload a page, React allows servers to re-render only parts that have changed, a feature that drastically speeds up performance and lowers the computing resources required by the server.Read full article Comments",

Without evidence, Prasad claimed COVID-19 vaccines have killed 10 children in the US, and, as such, he announced unilateral, sweeping changes to the way the agency regulates and approves vaccines, including seasonal flu shots. On Wednesday evening, a dozen former FDA commissioners, who collectively oversaw the agency for more than 35 years, responded to the memo with a scathing rebuke. Uniting to publish their response in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former commissioners said they were “deeply concerned” by Prasad’s memo, which they framed as a “threat” to the FDA’s work and a danger to Americans’ health. In his memo, Prasad called for abandoning the FDA’s current framework for updating seasonal flu shots and other vaccines, such as those for COVID-19. Those updates currently involve studies that measure well-characterized immune responses (called immunobridging studies). Prasad dismissed this approach as insufficient and, instead, plans to require expensive randomized trials, which can take months to years for each vaccine update.Read full article Comments",

The new BMW iX3 is an important car for the automaker. It’s the first of a new series of vehicles that BMW is calling the Neue Klasse, calling back to a range of cars that helped define the brand in the 1960s. Then, as now, propulsion is provided by the best powertrain BMW’s engineers could design and build, wrapped in styling that heralds the company’s new look. Except now, that powertrain is fully electric, and the cabin features technology that would have been scarcely believable to the driver of a new 1962 BMW 1500. In fact, the iX3 is only half the story when it comes to BMW’s neue look for the Neue Klasse—there’s an all-electric 3 series sedan on the way, too. The sedan will surely appeal to enthusiasts, particularly the version that the M tuning arm has worked its magic upon, but you’ll have to wait until early 2026 to read about that stuff. Which makes sense: crossovers and SUVs—or “sports activity vehicles” in BMW-speak—are what the market wants these days, so that’s what comes first. The technical stuff As we learned earlier this summer, BMW leaned heavily into sustainability when it designed the iX3. There’s extensive use of recycled battery minerals, interior plastics, and aluminum, and the automaker has gone for a monomaterial approach where possible to make recycling the car a lot easier. There’s also an all-new EV powertrain, BMW’s sixth-generation. When it goes on sale here next summer, the launch model will be the iX3 50 xDrive, which pairs an asynchronous motor at the front axle and an electrically excited synchronous motor at the rear for a combined output of 463 hp (345 kW) and 475 lb-ft (645 Nm).Read full article Comments",

Other Republicans opposed including the AI preemption in the defense bill, The Hill reported, joining critics who see value in allowing states to quickly regulate AI risks as they arise. For months, Trump has pressured the Republican-led Congress to block state AI laws that the president claims could bog down innovation as AI firms waste time and resources complying with a patchwork of state laws. But Republicans have continually failed to unite behind Trump’s command, first voting against including a similar measure in the “Big Beautiful” budget bill and then this week failing to negotiate a solution to pass the NDAA measure.Read full article Comments",

The most genetically diverse human populations—the groups that have had the longest time to pick up novel mutations—live there today. But the history of what went on within Africa between our origins and the present day is a bit murky. That’s partly because DNA doesn’t survive long in the conditions typical of most of the continent, which has largely limited us to trying to reconstruct the past using data from present-day populations. The other part is that many of those present-day populations have been impacted by the vast genetic churn caused by the Bantu expansion, which left its traces across most of the populations south of the Sahara. But a new study has managed to extract genomes from ancient samples in southern Africa. While all of these are relatively recent, dating from after the end of the most recent glacial period, they reveal a distinct southern African population that was relatively large, outside of the range of previously described human variation, and it remained isolated until only about 1,000 years ago.Read full article Comments",

It’s the sequel to this year’s critically acclaimed 28 Years Later, the third film in a franchise credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. (Some spoilers for the first three films below.) As previously reported, in 28 Days Later, a highly contagious “Rage Virus” was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called “fast zombies”—and the virus spread rapidly, effectively collapsing society. The sequel, 28 Weeks Later, featured a new cast of characters living on the outskirts of London. But all it takes is one careless person getting infected for the virus to spread uncontrollably again. So naturally, that’s what happened.Read full article Comments",

The adjustment is reportedly unusual for Microsoft, and it comes after the company missed a number of ambitious sales goals for its AI offerings. AI agents are specialized implementations of AI language models designed to perform multistep tasks autonomously rather than simply responding to single prompts. So-called “agentic” features have been central to Microsoft’s 2025 sales pitch: At its Build conference in May, the company declared that it has entered “the era of AI agents.” The company has promised customers that agents could automate complex tasks, such as generating dashboards from sales data or writing customer reports. At its Ignite conference in November, Microsoft announced new features like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, along with tools for building and deploying agents through Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. But as the year draws to a close, that promise has proven harder to deliver than the company expected.Read full article Comments",

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a co-recipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding. Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.Read full article Comments",

The move follows Google’s release of its Gemini 3 model last month, which has outperformed ChatGPT on some industry benchmark tests and sparked high-profile praise on social media. In the memo, Altman wrote, “We are at a critical time for ChatGPT.” The company will push back work on advertising integration, AI agents for health and shopping, and a personal assistant feature called Pulse. Altman encouraged temporary team transfers and established daily calls for employees responsible for enhancing the chatbot. The directive creates an odd symmetry with events from December 2022, when Google management declared its own “code red” internal emergency after ChatGPT launched and rapidly gained in popularity. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reassigned teams across the company to develop AI prototypes and products to compete with OpenAI’s chatbot.

Last month, security firm Sucuri reported that the operation seeks out and compromises poorly configured websites running the WordPress CMS.

Once the weaknesses are exploited, the attackers install a GSocket, a backdoor that the attackers use to compromise servers and host gambling web content on them. All of the gambling sites target Indonesian-speaking visitors. Because Indonesian law prohibits gambling, many people in that country are drawn to illicit services.

While the impact of these constellations on ground-based has been widely considered, orbital hardware was thought to be relatively immune from their interference. But the planned expansion of constellations, coupled with some of the features of upcoming missions, will mean that at least one proposed observatory will see an average of nearly 100 satellite tracks in every exposure. Making matters worse, some of the planned measures meant to minimize the impact on ground-based telescopes will make things worse for those in orbit. Constellations vs. astronomy Satellite constellations are a relatively new threat to astronomy; prior to the drop in launch costs driven by SpaceX’s reusable rockets, the largest constellations in orbit consisted of a few dozen satellites. But the rapid growth of the Starlink system caused problems for ground-based astronomy that are not easy to solve.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "There’s a race in China among several companies vying to become the next to launch and land an orbital-class rocket, and the starting gun could go off as soon as tonight. LandSpace, one of several maturing Chinese rocket startups, is about to launch the first flight of its medium-lift Zhuque-3 rocket. Liftoff could happen around 11 pm EST tonight (04:00 UTC Wednesday), or noon local time at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China. Airspace warning notices advising pilots to steer clear of the rocket’s flight path suggest LandSpace has a launch window of about two hours. When it lifts off, the Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket will become the largest commercial launch vehicle ever flown in China. What’s more, LandSpace will become the first Chinese launch provider to attempt a landing of its first stage booster, using the same tried-and-true return method pioneered by SpaceX and, more recently, Blue Origin in the United States.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It’s an incredible time to be a guitarist who doesn’t want to own a bunch of $2,000 amps and an expensive pedalboard of gear. Amp and pedal simulators, which have been around for decades, have in the last few years finally come into their own as nearly indistinguishable sonic replacements. Even John Mayer is now willing to ditch his beloved tube amps for digital models. I certainly don’t have Mayer’s chops or gear budget, but I do love messing with this sort of tech and have purchased everything from NeuralDSP‘s Archetypes series to Amplitube and Guitar Rig. Last week, as part of an early Black Friday sale, I picked up two amp/effects suites from British developer Polychrome DSP—Nunchuck (Marshall amps) and Lumos (clean through mid-gain tones). They are both excellent. Any reasonable person should be satisfied with this tech stack, which models gear that collectively costs as much as my house. After my Polychrome DSP purchases, I reminded myself that I am a reasonable person, and that I could therefore ignore any further amp sims that might tempt my wandering eye.Read full article Comments",
