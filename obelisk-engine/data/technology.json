          "content": "We’re running out of ways to tell you that Google is releasing more generative AI features, but that’s what’s happening in Google Photos today. The Big G is finally making good on its promise to add its market-leading Nano Banana image-editing model to the app. The model powers a couple of features, and it’s not just for Google’s Android platform. Nano Banana edits are also coming to the iOS version of the app. Nano Banana started making waves when it appeared earlier this year as an unbranded demo. You simply feed the model an image and tell it what edits you want to see. Google said Nano Banana was destined for the Photos app back in October, but it’s only now beginning the rollout. The Photos app already had conversational editing in the “Help Me Edit” feature, but it was running an older non-fruit model that produced inferior results. Nano Banana editing will produce AI slop, yes, but it’s better slop. Nano Banana in Help me edit Nano Banana in Help me edit Google says the updated Help Me Edit feature has access to your private face groups, so you can use names in your instructions. For example, you could type “Remove Riley’s sunglasses,” and Nano Banana will identify Riley in the photo (assuming you have a person of that name saved) and make the edit without further instructions. You can also ask for more fantastical edits in Help Me Edit, changing the style of the image from top to bottom.Read full article Comments",

Google is rolling out several AI updates to its Google Photos app, including iOS support for conversational edits, more accurate facial editing, and new AI tools. This means the “Help me edit” feature that lets you describe how you want Google’s AI to change your photos will be available to iPhone users, following its release on Pixel and other Android devices. “Starting to roll out on iOS in the US, you can simply describe the edits you want using your voice or text and watch Google Photos bring your vision to life,” Google said in its announcement blog. This update also brings the redesigned editor UI for Google Photos to iPhones, making it easy to adjust images with simple gestures and one-tap suggestions. New personalized editing capabilities should make changing something about you or your friends&#8217; faces — such as removing glasses, opening blinked eyes, or inserting a smile — more accurate by referencing images from your private face groups. Google’s Nano Banana AI model is also being integrated into Google Photos, giving users more options for transforming images into new styles like paintings, mosaics, and illustrations. Other updates include a new “Ask” button for Android and iOS users, which launches a chatbot-style interface to edit images and answer questions about their contents, and ready-made AI templates for Android users that let you instantly edit photos using popular prompts, such as “put me in a high fashion photoshoot.” The “Ask Photos” tool that makes it easier to find specific images in your gallery is also being expanded to more than 100 new regions and 17 new languages.",

It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund.

The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Black Friday deals are few and far between. However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirPods 4 for $85 (34 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

Which retailers have the best Black Friday tech deals? The best Black Friday tech deals are typically available online at retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target. It's also a good idea to check the store websites of the companies that make the products you want — for example, if you're looking for a Sonos speaker, check the Sonos website on Black Friday. Most of the time, you'll find the best Black Friday tech deals are matched at multiple retailers. Does Apple have Black Friday sales? No, you will usually not find Black Friday sales at Apple stores or on Apple's website. However, you can find Black Friday deals on Apple devices elsewhere; we recommend checking Amazon, Best Buy and other big retailers for discounts on iPads, Apple Watches and more on Black Friday. Does Amazon have Black Friday sales? Yes, Amazon has Black Friday sales. The online retailer's site will look similar to Prime Day on Black Friday, with discounts on all sorts of items from household essentials to fashion to tech.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-for-2025-are-here-early-we-found-the-best-tech-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-anker-and-others-100052831.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirPods 4 for $85 (34 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

Apple's most affordable smartwatch is even cheaper right now, down to just $200.

The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you'll find in those more expensive devices as well.

Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 3, which you can snag for $100 off. The sale model comes with 64GB of storage, a 49mm screen and GPS and cellular service. Notably, it's also only available with the one size, adjustable band and in two colors: a Black titanium case with Black Ocean band and a natural titanium Case with Anchor Blue Ocean band. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 came out in early September and is one of the first smartwatches to support satellite communications. This feature means you can call, send messages or share your location with emergency services through the watch — even if you don't have a connection. The new Ultra 3 also has a larger screen thanks to thinner bezels and a battery that can last for up to 42 hours.

          "standfirst": "Dyson is holding an early Black Friday sale on vacuums and related products. Sure, Black Friday isn't for another month, but who are we to turn down a fantastic deal? To that end, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum is a whopping $600 off and down to $400 right now. That's $100 less than its previous all-time low and the cheapest we've seen it. Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) one of the strongest in the category. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we've tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you'll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson's mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you're looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don't mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option. Cordless vacuums are also a part of the sale. Take the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for just $270, which is a discount of $330. That's more than half off. Dyson devices are all over our list of the best cordless vacuums, and for good reason. The company makes effective products. The V9 Motorbar has been designed to clean all floor types, in addition to upholstery. It's also been engineered to squeeze into tight spots, which is great for hitting those oft-neglected parts of the home. The suction power is on point and the battery lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a charge. That's just enough time to vacuum a standard-sized home if you don't stop for too many breaks. The V9 is getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. If you want a newer model, the V11 Extra is on sale for $400, which is a discount of $260. This one boosts the suction power and increases the battery life to 60 minutes.

The company typically reserves this sale for Prime Day, so it's nice to see the deal make an unexpected return. This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That's not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still. Audible has a diverse catalog that goes beyond audiobooks. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases.

          "content": "Amazon is selling three months of Audible for just $3 in honor of Black Friday. The company typically reserves this sale for Prime Day, so it's nice to see the deal make an unexpected return. This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That's not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still. Audible has a diverse catalog that goes beyond audiobooks. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases.

          "standfirst": "The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop has long hovered at $799 at Amazon — a full $200 below its Apple Store price. But it just dropped down to $749, which is the lowest price we've seen since this model was introduced in March. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, across all four colorways, but the 512GB model is also down to $949 — another all-time low versus the Apple Store price of $1,199. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future. (Read: sometime in early 2026). If you need more screen space, you'll find a similar discount on the 15-inch MacBook Air on Amazon, too. Most color options are $250 off and down to $949 for the base model (you guessed it — another all-time low).

If you don’t feel like hunting through eBay and local game shops for old cartridges to add to your loved one’s collection, we’ve picked out a few other gift ideas for the nostalgic gamer in your life — from video upscalers for old consoles to retro-themed books and artwork. Best retro gaming gifts FAQs Why do people buy retro games? Because they’re fun! Or because video game companies have generally had a spotty record of preserving their own history — and (legally) saving art, even in a minuscule way, is important. Or because, deep down, collectors just want to stave off the ceaseless march of time and hang onto any way to relive their youth before it dissipates for good. Or because they’re jaded with modern game design and crave shorter, more distinct or altogether different experiences that aren’t being served by today’s market. Or because they want to flip the games they collect for a quick buck on eBay. Or because… well, you get the idea. — J.D. Why is retro gaming so expensive? To put it simply: supply and demand. Companies aren’t making old games and consoles any more, yet a growing number of gaming enthusiasts want them. And as retro game collecting has grown more popular, sellers have become more acutely aware of how high they can price their goods. Not every retro game costs an arm and a leg, however: Popular games from relatively recent consoles are usually more affordable than lesser-selling titles for older hardware, and you can still find a good bargain every now and then by digging through local yard sales, individual eBay sellers and the like. — J.D. Are retro games a good investment? It depends on how you define “good.” Is it a good idea to buy a bunch of old games in the hopes that their value will skyrocket and make you a tidy profit? No, there’s little rhyme or reason to determining exactly which games will shoot up in value and by how much. There are much safer ways to invest if all you care about are financial returns. Is it a good idea to drop a bunch of cash on 40-year-old video games if you have pressing financial responsibilities? Probably not! But hey, it’s your life. If collecting retro games makes you happy, and you can budget for them within reason, that’s a good thing. Have fun. — J.D. What qualifies as a retro game? There’s no set definition for when a video game becomes “retro.” Personally, I think of it as any game that’s at least 10 years old and was originally released on a console that’s two or more generations old (or, for PC games, during that generation). But many others would stretch the timeline back farther, and the growing advent of “live service” games has complicated things. For instance, Grand Theft Auto V was released in 2013, while World of Warcraft arrived in 2004 — are those “retro games” when millions of people still play them today? Maybe not. With games from the ‘90s or earlier, though, the distinction is clearer. — J.D.

          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-75-percent-off-proton-vpn-two-year-plans-before-black-friday-153737772.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we’re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.Editor's note: Amazon announced a revamped family of Kindle Scribe E Ink tablets in September 2025. The Kindle Scribe 3 is thinner and lighter than its predecessor with faster page-turning and writing experiences. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is the first full-color addition to the lineup, with a pen that will support writing in 10 colors and highlighting in five different shades. Both new Scribe tablets will be available in the US \"later this year.\" You can read our Kindle Scribe Colorsoft hands on to get a first look, but we'll update this guide once we've had the chance to test out both new E Ink tablets. Table of contents Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? What to look for in an E Ink tablet Other E Ink tablets we've tested Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Onyx Boox Tab X C The Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet. Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",
          "content": "E Ink tablets have always been intriguing to me because I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper. I’ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens.

          "standfirst": "The Rodecaster series of podcast mixers have become a mainstay among audio creatives. Last year, the company expanded the line with its first multimedia model — the Rodecaster Video. It was a more niche proposition, aimed at streamers, video podcasters and live producers, and, at $1,200, people with deeper pockets. Today, Rode returns with the Rodecaster Video S (RCV-S), a streamlined version that offers much of the same functionality for less than half the cost of the original ($499). If you currently use Ecamm Live, OBS, a Stream Deck, a Rodecaster Pro/Duo, a video capture card or Blackmagic Atem type switcher, then there’s a good chance the RCV-S does something, or many things, useful to you. Maybe it can replace all those products, some of them or enhance your workflow. It’s a little complicated, but within that complication is a lot of versatility. With three HDMI inputs, one USB webcam/mic input and up to four NDI/wireless camera inputs, video is clearly the focus here. But there are also two XLR/Combo ports for studio microphones and instruments and the option to connect up to two of Rode’s wireless lav mics (such as the Wireless Go) directly without the need for a receiver. The RCV-S, like Blackmagic’s popular Atem Mini, outputs over HDMI at 1080p/60 (no 4K) or can be used over USB as a virtual camera just like you’d find in Zoom or Teams. Unlike the Rodecaster Pro or Duo, there are no faders; instead, there are two rows of pads for switching between video sources and scenes. There’s 20GB of onboard storage for media — such as overlays, graphics and audio/video clips — and you can record shows directly onto USB hard-drives or stream natively to Twitch, YouTube and other platforms via RTMP/S. There’s a lot going on, and how you want to use it all is largely up to you. While the RCV-S leans more toward “live” productions such as streaming or podcasts, you can use it for conventional YouTube-style video production, depending on your workflow or video preferences. Rodecaster Video versus Rodecaster Video S The huge price difference between the original Rodecaster Video and the new S model might lead you to expect some serious feature trimming this time around, but Rode’s garden shears have been fairly kind. Most notably, the number of sources you can connect has been reduced from six to four. Meanwhile, the number of “scenes” you can create is now five, down from seven. As mentioned above, there are three HDMI inputs, not four, and only one USB webcam/mic input, down from two on the original. There are still nine channels of audio with two headphone outputs, but the line outputs on the original are no longer here. The SD card slot for media has also been removed in favor of internal storage. In short, there’s a little bit less connectivity, but not enough for it to feel hobbled, especially for the more casual users this is clearly aimed at. In-use At its most basic, the RCV-S is an all-in-one video switcher. You don’t need to connect it to a PC, just plug in your video and audio sources and you can jump between them in real time with a choice of transitions. For a more polished production you can create “scenes” via the menu with a selection of layouts for multiple cameras, picture-in-picture and so on. That could be two talking heads for a podcast, overlaying your web camera on top of your gameplay or a top-down camera mixed with a different perspective for cooking tutorials or presentations. You can create scenes directly on the device in advance or live via templates, but things get a lot easier and more creative when you use Rode’s companion Rodecaster app. Here, you’ll find a “scene creator” tool that’s both visual and intuitive, plus it has the option to make custom layouts where you can freely resize and place all your different media wherever you want, add borders or rounded corners and so on. While the main pads are primarily for switching between sources and scenes, they can also trigger media — pre-made video clips, overlays and graphics, for example. You can assign media to them without reducing the number of sources/scenes that are available to switch between, just tap the Media/Overlay button to temporarily change the functionality of the pads. You can also set up chromakey/green screening directly on the device or via the Rodecaster App, too. Once you have everything set up, you can directly record output onto a USB SSD, again, without the need for a PC. There’s even the option to record only the main output (“program”) or a multi-track version which will export a recording of every input as a separate file that you can edit as you see fit. This is helpful if you’re using apps like Adobe Premier or Davinci Resolve. If you shoot multi-camera dance tutorials, for example, you can jump between your main and wide camera and then to a close up without having to hunt-down the right part from each file you recorded on different memory cards. Rode recently updated the Rodecaster Video firmware to add support for up to four “NDI” wireless cameras as additional sources. Typically these are remote or security-style cameras, but Rode’s Capture mobile app also supports NDI streaming, meaning you can use your phone wirelessly as another camera that you can switch to, which is particularly useful. Though do note, the Rodecaster Video will need to be hard-wired to your router on the same network as your phone for this to work. Audio The Rodecaster Video S handles audio and video with ease. James Trew for Engadget While the RCV-S offers nine audio tracks, it’s fair to say it isn’t really designed for live audio mixing in the pure sense since there are no faders. Instead, you have to access different channels via the menu on a small display and a dial — It’s a lot of hunting and pecking. If you’re connected to a PC, the Rodecaster app does offer a software mixer with faders though, which makes adjusting levels on the fly much easier. The good news is that some voice enhancement tools, such as Depth, Sparkle and Punch have been carried over from the Rodecaster Pro/Duo, giving you a little more fine-grained control over how you or your guests sound. There’s a slight drawback when using the RCV-S as a standalone unit, in that you need to physically push the buttons to change the scene, which might not be ideal if you’re trying to make a polished recording or can’t always be near the console. Thankfully, Rode has a solution in “auto switching.” I’m mentioning it here, in the audio section, as the RCV-S can switch cameras based on which one has the strongest audio or based on user-defined priority. Typically, that would be whoever is talking in a podcast, but it could also be in-game sound or when you switch to playing a musical instrument. Auto switching works well, but it’s not quite dependable enough to rely on for full autonomy in a professional environment — say while recording a panel at a conference — but it solves a problem if you’re on your own, and it could at least save some time in a casual podcast situation. Things to consider The Rodecaster Video S (top) vs. The Rodecaster Video (bottom) James Trew for Engadget It’s clear that the RCV-S, despite having fewer inputs than the original Rodecaster Video, is still quite a complex, open-ended tool. If you already have a streaming setup you like and the software and interfaces you need, then the appeal of the RCV-S will be down to whether it can do what you need more efficiently. For live video production, it’s an easier sell, as there aren’t many all-in-one devices to compete with it that can be used standalone. For example, Blackmagic’s Atem series is incredibly popular, and until now, had the advantage on price with the Mini Pro costing just $330. Even the Mini Pro ISO ($550) that exports multi-track video was half the price of the original Rodecaster Video. The RCV-S now offers comparable connectivity, onboard recording, more expansive audio features and multi-track export for $50 less. For general content creators it’s a little trickier. As someone that makes YouTube videos, the appeal to me is the chance to consolidate a few devices into one and remove some friction in my recordings. Right now, I have a Rodecaster Duo handling my audio, a capture card for my main camera and I swap out that camera for a smaller one if I am shooting top-down footage or need a second angle. That means I have several different devices on my desk, and I’m constantly doing a dance of unplugging things and juggling media or different recordings before I get everything ready to edit. The Rodecaster Video S has a tiny display for menus and settings. James Trew for Engadget With the RCV-S I can ditch my standalone capture card and permanently leave multiple cameras connected to the Rodecaster so that they are ready to go at any time. I can even remove the Rodecaster Duo and bring it back out again on the occasions I need more immediate control over multiple sources of audio (which is sometimes, but not often). The appeal in my case is fewer devices on my desk, and the ability to record multi-camera video without having to set up every shot, every single time, which saves significant time that I can then use to actually get more work done. There are, of course, some limitations. Not least of all is the lack of 4K. I’m still inclined to record on camera for my primary shot to ensure I still have a 4K copy for YouTube and then use the Rodecaster Video S for everything else, but as a small creator, convenience and flexibility is very appealing. For streamers and live video production, the Rodecaster Video S is a very capable tool that offers a wide range of functionality for an accessible price that will no doubt become the central hub for many creators. The real kicker here is the price. Let’s be clear, $500 is still significant money. But at less than half the price of the original Rodecaster with decent connectivity and basically the same functionality, it's an easy recommendation to those who were holding off based on price alone. Likewise, if you’re just starting out with content creation and need something with solid video credentials and audio chops, Rode makes a good case for itself with the Rodecaster Video S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/rodecaster-video-s-review-compact-and-comprehensive-video-production-230000221.html?src=rss",

You can create scenes directly on the device in advance or live via templates, but things get a lot easier and more creative when you use Rode’s companion Rodecaster app. Here, you’ll find a “scene creator” tool that’s both visual and intuitive, plus it has the option to make custom layouts where you can freely resize and place all your different media wherever you want, add borders or rounded corners and so on. While the main pads are primarily for switching between sources and scenes, they can also trigger media — pre-made video clips, overlays and graphics, for example. You can assign media to them without reducing the number of sources/scenes that are available to switch between, just tap the Media/Overlay button to temporarily change the functionality of the pads. You can also set up chromakey/green screening directly on the device or via the Rodecaster App, too. Once you have everything set up, you can directly record output onto a USB SSD, again, without the need for a PC. There’s even the option to record only the main output (“program”) or a multi-track version which will export a recording of every input as a separate file that you can edit as you see fit. This is helpful if you’re using apps like Adobe Premier or Davinci Resolve. If you shoot multi-camera dance tutorials, for example, you can jump between your main and wide camera and then to a close up without having to hunt-down the right part from each file you recorded on different memory cards. Rode recently updated the Rodecaster Video firmware to add support for up to four “NDI” wireless cameras as additional sources. Typically these are remote or security-style cameras, but Rode’s Capture mobile app also supports NDI streaming, meaning you can use your phone wirelessly as another camera that you can switch to, which is particularly useful. Though do note, the Rodecaster Video will need to be hard-wired to your router on the same network as your phone for this to work. Audio The Rodecaster Video S handles audio and video with ease. James Trew for Engadget While the RCV-S offers nine audio tracks, it’s fair to say it isn’t really designed for live audio mixing in the pure sense since there are no faders. Instead, you have to access different channels via the menu on a small display and a dial — It’s a lot of hunting and pecking. If you’re connected to a PC, the Rodecaster app does offer a software mixer with faders though, which makes adjusting levels on the fly much easier. The good news is that some voice enhancement tools, such as Depth, Sparkle and Punch have been carried over from the Rodecaster Pro/Duo, giving you a little more fine-grained control over how you or your guests sound. There’s a slight drawback when using the RCV-S as a standalone unit, in that you need to physically push the buttons to change the scene, which might not be ideal if you’re trying to make a polished recording or can’t always be near the console. Thankfully, Rode has a solution in “auto switching.” I’m mentioning it here, in the audio section, as the RCV-S can switch cameras based on which one has the strongest audio or based on user-defined priority. Typically, that would be whoever is talking in a podcast, but it could also be in-game sound or when you switch to playing a musical instrument. Auto switching works well, but it’s not quite dependable enough to rely on for full autonomy in a professional environment — say while recording a panel at a conference — but it solves a problem if you’re on your own, and it could at least save some time in a casual podcast situation. Things to consider The Rodecaster Video S (top) vs. The Rodecaster Video (bottom) James Trew for Engadget It’s clear that the RCV-S, despite having fewer inputs than the original Rodecaster Video, is still quite a complex, open-ended tool. If you already have a streaming setup you like and the software and interfaces you need, then the appeal of the RCV-S will be down to whether it can do what you need more efficiently. For live video production, it’s an easier sell, as there aren’t many all-in-one devices to compete with it that can be used standalone. For example, Blackmagic’s Atem series is incredibly popular, and until now, had the advantage on price with the Mini Pro costing just $330. Even the Mini Pro ISO ($550) that exports multi-track video was half the price of the original Rodecaster Video. The RCV-S now offers comparable connectivity, onboard recording, more expansive audio features and multi-track export for $50 less. For general content creators it’s a little trickier. As someone that makes YouTube videos, the appeal to me is the chance to consolidate a few devices into one and remove some friction in my recordings. Right now, I have a Rodecaster Duo handling my audio, a capture card for my main camera and I swap out that camera for a smaller one if I am shooting top-down footage or need a second angle. That means I have several different devices on my desk, and I’m constantly doing a dance of unplugging things and juggling media or different recordings before I get everything ready to edit. The Rodecaster Video S has a tiny display for menus and settings. James Trew for Engadget With the RCV-S I can ditch my standalone capture card and permanently leave multiple cameras connected to the Rodecaster so that they are ready to go at any time. I can even remove the Rodecaster Duo and bring it back out again on the occasions I need more immediate control over multiple sources of audio (which is sometimes, but not often). The appeal in my case is fewer devices on my desk, and the ability to record multi-camera video without having to set up every shot, every single time, which saves significant time that I can then use to actually get more work done. There are, of course, some limitations. Not least of all is the lack of 4K. I’m still inclined to record on camera for my primary shot to ensure I still have a 4K copy for YouTube and then use the Rodecaster Video S for everything else, but as a small creator, convenience and flexibility is very appealing. For streamers and live video production, the Rodecaster Video S is a very capable tool that offers a wide range of functionality for an accessible price that will no doubt become the central hub for many creators. The real kicker here is the price. Let’s be clear, $500 is still significant money. But at less than half the price of the original Rodecaster with decent connectivity and basically the same functionality, it's an easy recommendation to those who were holding off based on price alone. Likewise, if you’re just starting out with content creation and need something with solid video credentials and audio chops, Rode makes a good case for itself with the Rodecaster Video S.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/rodecaster-video-s-review-compact-and-comprehensive-video-production-230000221.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Meta returns to open source AI with Omnilingual ASR models that can transcribe 1,600+ languages natively",
          "standfirst": "Meta has just released a new multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) system supporting 1,600+ languages — dwarfing OpenAI’s open source Whisper model, which supports just 99. Is architecture also allows developers to extend that support to thousands more. Through a feature called zero-shot in-context learning, users can provide a few paired examples of audio and text in a new language at inference time, enabling the model to transcribe additional utterances in that language without any retraining.In practice, this expands potential coverage to more than 5,400 languages — roughly every spoken language with a known script.It’s a shift from static model capabilities to a flexible framework that communities can adapt themselves. So while the 1,600 languages reflect official training coverage, the broader figure represents Omnilingual ASR’s capacity to generalize on demand, making it the most extensible speech recognition system released to date.Best of all: it&#x27;s been open sourced under a plain Apache 2.0 license — not a restrictive, quasi open-source Llama license like the company&#x27;s prior releases, which limited use by larger enterprises unless they paid licensing fees — meaning researchers and developers are free to take and implement it right away, for free, without restrictions, even in commercial and enterprise-grade projects!Released on November 10 on Meta&#x27;s website, Github, along with a demo space on Hugging Face and technical paper, Meta’s Omnilingual ASR suite includes a family of speech recognition models, a 7-billion parameter multilingual audio representation model, and a massive speech corpus spanning over 350 previously underserved languages. All resources are freely available under open licenses, and the models support speech-to-text transcription out of the box.“By open sourcing these models and dataset, we aim to break down language barriers, expand digital access, and empower communities worldwide,” Meta posted on its @AIatMeta account on XDesigned for Speech-to-Text TranscriptionAt its core, Omnilingual ASR is a speech-to-text system. The models are trained to convert spoken language into written text, supporting applications like voice assistants, transcription tools, subtitles, oral archive digitization, and accessibility features for low-resource languages.Unlike earlier ASR models that required extensive labeled training data, Omnilingual ASR includes a zero-shot variant. This version can transcribe languages it has never seen before—using just a few paired examples of audio and corresponding text. This lowers the barrier for adding new or endangered languages dramatically, removing the need for large corpora or retraining.Model Family and Technical DesignThe Omnilingual ASR suite includes multiple model families trained on more than 4.3 million hours of audio from 1,600+ languages:wav2vec 2.0 models for self-supervised speech representation learning (300M–7B parameters)CTC-based ASR models for efficient supervised transcriptionLLM-ASR models combining a speech encoder with a Transformer-based text decoder for state-of-the-art transcriptionLLM-ZeroShot ASR model, enabling inference-time adaptation to unseen languagesAll models follow an encoder–decoder design: raw audio is converted into a language-agnostic representation, then decoded into written text.Why the Scale MattersWhile Whisper and similar models have advanced ASR capabilities for global languages, they fall short on the long tail of human linguistic diversity. Whisper supports 99 languages. Meta’s system:Directly supports 1,600+ languagesCan generalize to 5,400+ languages using in-context learningAchieves character error rates (CER) under 10% in 78% of supported languagesAmong those supported are more than 500 languages never previously covered by any ASR model, according to Meta’s research paper.This expansion opens new possibilities for communities whose languages are often excluded from digital toolsHere’s the revised and expanded background section, integrating the broader context of Meta’s 2025 AI strategy, leadership changes, and Llama 4’s reception, complete with in-text citations and links:Background: Meta’s AI Overhaul and a Rebound from Llama 4The release of Omnilingual ASR arrives at a pivotal moment in Meta’s AI strategy, following a year marked by organizational turbulence, leadership changes, and uneven product execution. Omnilingual ASR is the first major open-source model release since the rollout of Llama 4, Meta’s latest large language model, which debuted in April 2025 to mixed and ultimately poor reviews, with scant enterprise adoption compared to Chinese open source model competitors.The failure led Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appoint Alexandr Wang, co-founder and prior CEO of AI data supplier Scale AI, as Chief AI Officer, and embark on an extensive and costly hiring spree that shocked the AI and business communities with eye-watering pay packages for top AI researchers.In contrast, Omnilingual ASR represents a strategic and reputational reset. It returns Meta to a domain where the company has historically led — multilingual AI — and offers a truly extensible, community-oriented stack with minimal barriers to entry. The system’s support for 1,600+ languages and its extensibility to over 5,000 more via zero-shot in-context learning reassert Meta’s engineering credibility in language technology. Importantly, it does so through a free and permissively licensed release, under Apache 2.0, with transparent dataset sourcing and reproducible training protocols.This shift aligns with broader themes in Meta’s 2025 strategy. The company has refocused its narrative around a “personal superintelligence” vision, investing heavily in infrastructure (including a September release of custom AI accelerators and Arm-based inference stacks) source while downplaying the metaverse in favor of foundational AI capabilities. The return to public training data in Europe after a regulatory pause also underscores its intention to compete globally, despite privacy scrutiny source.Omnilingual ASR, then, is more than a model release — it’s a calculated move to reassert control of the narrative: from the fragmented rollout of Llama 4 to a high-utility, research-grounded contribution that aligns with Meta’s long-term AI platform strategy.Community-Centered Dataset CollectionTo achieve this scale, Meta partnered with researchers and community organizations in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere to create the Omnilingual ASR Corpus, a 3,350-hour dataset across 348 low-resource languages. Contributors were compensated local speakers, and recordings were gathered in collaboration with groups like:African Next Voices: A Gates Foundation–supported consortium including Maseno University (Kenya), University of Pretoria, and Data Science NigeriaMozilla Foundation’s Common Voice, supported through the Open Multilingual Speech FundLanfrica / NaijaVoices, which created data for 11 African languages including Igala, Serer, and UrhoboThe data collection focused on natural, unscripted speech. Prompts were designed to be culturally relevant and open-ended, such as “Is it better to have a few close friends or many casual acquaintances? Why?” Transcriptions used established writing systems, with quality assurance built into every step.Performance and Hardware ConsiderationsThe largest model in the suite, the omniASR_LLM_7B, requires ~17GB of GPU memory for inference, making it suitable for deployment on high-end hardware. Smaller models (300M–1B) can run on lower-power devices and deliver real-time transcription speeds.Performance benchmarks show strong results even in low-resource scenarios:CER <10% in 95% of high-resource and mid-resource languagesCER <10% in 36% of low-resource languagesRobustness in noisy conditions and unseen domains, especially with fine-tuningThe zero-shot system, omniASR_LLM_7B_ZS, can transcribe new languages with minimal setup. Users provide a few sample audio–text pairs, and the model generates transcriptions for new utterances in the same language.Open Access and Developer ToolingAll models and the dataset are licensed under permissive terms:Apache 2.0 for models and codeCC-BY 4.0 for the Omnilingual ASR Corpus on HuggingFaceInstallation is supported via PyPI and uv:pip install omnilingual-asrMeta also provides:A HuggingFace dataset integrationPre-built inference pipelinesLanguage-code conditioning for improved accuracyDevelopers can view the full list of supported languages using the API:from omnilingual_asr.models.wav2vec2_llama.lang_ids import supported_langsprint(len(supported_langs)) print(supported_langs)Broader ImplicationsOmnilingual ASR reframes language coverage in ASR from a fixed list to an extensible framework. It enables:Community-driven inclusion of underrepresented languagesDigital access for oral and endangered languagesResearch on speech tech in linguistically diverse contextsCrucially, Meta emphasizes ethical considerations throughout—advocating for open-source participation and collaboration with native-speaking communities.“No model can ever anticipate and include all of the world’s languages in advance,” the Omnilingual ASR paper states, “but Omnilingual ASR makes it possible for communities to extend recognition with their own data.”Access the ToolsAll resources are now available at:Code + Models: github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asrDataset: huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/omnilingual-asr-corpusBlogpost: ai.meta.com/blog/omnilingual-asrWhat This Means for EnterprisesFor enterprise developers, especially those operating in multilingual or international markets, Omnilingual ASR significantly lowers the barrier to deploying speech-to-text systems across a broader range of customers and geographies. Instead of relying on commercial ASR APIs that support only a narrow set of high-resource languages, teams can now integrate an open-source pipeline that covers over 1,600 languages out of the box—with the option to extend it to thousands more via zero-shot learning.This flexibility is especially valuable for enterprises working in sectors like voice-based customer support, transcription services, accessibility, education, or civic technology, where local language coverage can be a competitive or regulatory necessity. Because the models are released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, businesses can fine-tune, deploy, or integrate them into proprietary systems without restrictive terms.It also represents a shift in the ASR landscape—from centralized, cloud-gated offerings to community-extendable infrastructure. By making multilingual speech recognition more accessible, customizable, and cost-effective, Omnilingual ASR opens the door to a new generation of enterprise speech applications built around linguistic inclusion rather than linguistic limitation.",

The deal for new subscribers is just $49 for the first year, marked down from $98. The real value is in selecting Peacock Premium, which would normally run you $110 per year on its own. With the current discount on a Walmart+ subscription you are essentially getting half off on your streaming subscription for that year. Just about every major streaming service has raised its prices in the last year, including HBO Max, Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV and YouTube TV, so saving some money on one of them just might be worth the effort. Cord cutting is not nearly as affordable as it used to be, so finding a deal like this is pretty helpful. Walmart+ itself offers myriad additional benefits like early access to Black Friday deals, free shipping on orders over $35, discounts on gas, free online veterinary care and more. Earlier this year, Walmart+ subscribers got first dibs on the Nintendo Switch 2 at the retailer. You can also use that free shipping to take advantage of Walmart's drone delivery program in a handful of select cities.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/use-this-hack-to-get-one-year-of-peacock-for-49-before-black-friday-192739041.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Chronosphere, a New York-based observability startup valued at $1.6 billion, announced Monday it will launch AI-Guided Troubleshooting capabilities designed to help engineers diagnose and fix production software failures — a problem that has intensified as artificial intelligence tools accelerate code creation while making systems harder to debug.The new features combine AI-driven analysis with what Chronosphere calls a Temporal Knowledge Graph, a continuously updated map of an organization&#x27;s services, infrastructure dependencies, and system changes over time. The technology aims to address a mounting challenge in enterprise software: developers are writing code faster than ever with AI assistance, but troubleshooting remains largely manual, creating bottlenecks when applications fail.\"For AI to be effective in observability, it needs more than pattern recognition and summarization,\" said Martin Mao, Chronosphere&#x27;s CEO and co-founder, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Chronosphere has spent years building the data foundation and analytical depth needed for AI to actually help engineers. With our Temporal Knowledge Graph and advanced analytics capabilities, we&#x27;re giving AI the understanding it needs to make observability truly intelligent — and giving engineers the confidence to trust its guidance.\"The announcement comes as the observability market — software that monitors complex cloud applications— faces mounting pressure to justify escalating costs. Enterprise log data volumes have grown 250% year-over-year, according to Chronosphere&#x27;s own research, while a study from MIT and the University of Pennsylvania found that generative AI has spurred a 13.5% increase in weekly code commits, signifying faster development velocity but also greater system complexity.AI writes code 13% faster, but debugging stays stubbornly manualDespite advances in automated code generation, debugging production failures remains stubbornly manual. When a major e-commerce site slows during checkout or a banking app fails to process transactions, engineers must sift through millions of data points — server logs, application traces, infrastructure metrics, recent code deployments — to identify root causes.Chronosphere&#x27;s answer is what it calls AI-Guided Troubleshooting, built on four core capabilities: automated \"Suggestions\" that propose investigation paths backed by data; the Temporal Knowledge Graph that maps system relationships and changes; Investigation Notebooks that document each troubleshooting step for future reference; and natural language query building.Mao explained the Temporal Knowledge Graph in practical terms: \"It&#x27;s a living, time-aware model of your system. It stitches together telemetry—metrics, traces, logs—infrastructure context, change events like deploys and feature flags, and even human input like notes and runbooks into a single, queryable map that updates as your system evolves.\"This differs fundamentally from the service dependency maps offered by competitors like Datadog, Dynatrace, and Splunk, Mao argued. \"It adds time, not just topology,\" he said. \"It tracks how services and dependencies change over time and connects those changes to incidents—what changed and why. Many tools rely on standardized integrations; our graph goes a step further to normalize custom, non-standard telemetry so application-specific signals aren&#x27;t a blind spot.\"Why Chronosphere shows its work instead of making automatic decisionsUnlike purely automated systems, Chronosphere designed its AI features to keep engineers in the driver&#x27;s seat—a deliberate choice meant to address what Mao calls the \"confident-but-wrong guidance\" problem plaguing early AI observability tools.\"&#x27;Keeping engineers in control&#x27; means the AI shows its work, proposes next steps, and lets engineers verify or override — never auto-deciding behind the scenes,\" Mao explained. \"Every Suggestion includes the evidence—timing, dependencies, error patterns — and a &#x27;Why was this suggested?&#x27; view, so they can inspect what was checked and ruled out before acting.\"He walked through a concrete example: \"An SLO [service level objective] alert fires on Checkout. Chronosphere immediately surfaces a ranked Suggestion: errors appear to have started in the dependent Payment service. An engineer can click Investigate to see the charts and reasoning and, if it holds up, choose to dig deeper. As they steer into Payment, the system adapts with new Suggestions scoped to that service—all from one view, no tab-hopping.\"In this scenario, the engineer asks \"what changed?\" and the system pulls in change events. \"Our Notebook capability makes the causal chain plain: a feature-flag update preceded pod memory exhaustion in Payment; Checkout&#x27;s spike is a downstream symptom,\" Mao said. \"They can decide to roll back the flag. That whole path — suggestions followed, evidence viewed, conclusions—is captured automatically in an Investigation Notebook, and the outcome feeds the Temporal Knowledge Graph so similar future incidents are faster to resolve.\"How a $1.6 billion startup takes on Datadog, Dynatrace, and SplunkChronosphere enters an increasingly crowded field. Datadog, the publicly traded observability leader valued at over $40 billion, has introduced its own AI-powered troubleshooting features. So have Dynatrace and Splunk. All three offer comprehensive \"all-in-one\" platforms that promise single-pane-of-glass visibility.Mao distinguished Chronosphere&#x27;s approach on technical grounds. \"Early &#x27;AI for observability&#x27; leaned heavily on pattern-spotting and summarization, which tends to break down during real incidents,\" he said. \"These approaches often stop at correlating anomalies or producing fluent explanations without the deeper analysis and causal reasoning observability leaders need. They can feel impressive in demos but disappoint in production—they summarize signals rather than explain cause and effect.\"A specific technical gap, he argued, involves custom application telemetry. \"Most platforms reason over standardized integrations—Kubernetes, common cloud services, popular databases—ignoring the most telling clues that live in custom app telemetry,\" Mao said. \"With an incomplete picture, large language models will &#x27;fill in the gaps,&#x27; producing confident-but-wrong guidance that sends teams down dead ends.\"Chronosphere&#x27;s competitive positioning received validation in July when Gartner named it a Leader in the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms for the second consecutive year. The firm was recognized based on both \"Completeness of Vision\" and \"Ability to Execute.\" In December 2024, Chronosphere also tied for the highest overall rating among recognized vendors in Gartner Peer Insights&#x27; \"Voice of the Customer\" report, scoring 4.7 out of 5 based on 70 reviews.Yet the company faces intensifying competition for high-profile customers. UBS analysts noted in July that OpenAI now runs both Datadog and Chronosphere side-by-side to monitor GPU workloads, suggesting the AI leader is evaluating alternatives. While UBS maintained its buy rating on Datadog, the analysts warned that growing Chronosphere usage could pressure Datadog&#x27;s pricing power.Inside the 84% cost reduction claims—and what CIOs should actually measureBeyond technical capabilities, Chronosphere has built its market position on cost control — a critical factor as observability spending spirals. The company claims its platform reduces data volumes and associated costs by 84% on average while cutting critical incidents by up to 75%.When pressed for specific customer examples with real numbers, Mao pointed to several case studies. \"Robinhood has seen a 5x improvement in reliability and a 4x improvement in Mean Time to Detection,\" he said. \"DoorDash used Chronosphere to improve governance and standardize monitoring practices. Astronomer achieved over 85% cost reduction by shaping data on ingest, and Affirm scaled their load 10x during a Black Friday event with no issues, highlighting the platform&#x27;s reliability under extreme conditions.\"The cost argument matters because, as Paul Nashawaty, principal analyst at CUBE Research, noted when Chronosphere launched its Logs 2.0 product in June: \"Organizations are drowning in telemetry data, with over 70% of observability spend going toward storing logs that are never queried.\"For CIOs fatigued by \"AI-powered\" announcements, Mao acknowledged skepticism is warranted. \"The way to cut through it is to test whether the AI shortens incidents, reduces toil, and builds reusable knowledge in your own environment, not in a demo,\" he advised. He recommended CIOs evaluate three factors: transparency and control (does the system show its reasoning?), coverage of custom telemetry (can it handle non-standardized data?), and manual toil avoided (how many ad-hoc queries and tool-switches are eliminated?).Why Chronosphere partners with five vendors instead of building everything itselfAlongside the AI troubleshooting announcement, Chronosphere revealed a new Partner Program integrating five specialized vendors to fill gaps in its platform: Arize for large language model monitoring, Embrace for real user monitoring, Polar Signals for continuous profiling, Checkly for synthetic monitoring, and Rootly for incident management.The strategy represents a deliberate bet against the all-in-one platforms dominating the market. \"While an all-in-one platform may be sufficient for smaller organizations, global enterprises demand best-in-class depth across each domain,\" Mao said. \"This is what drove us to build our Partner Program and invest in seamless integrations with leading providers—so our customers can operate with confidence and clarity at every layer of observability.\"Noah Smolen, head of partnerships at Arize, said the collaboration addresses a specific enterprise need. \"With a wide array of Fortune 500 customers, we understand the high bar needed to ensure AI agent systems are ready to deploy and stay incident-free, especially given the pace of AI adoption in the enterprise,\" Smolen said. \"Our partnership with Chronosphere comes at a time when an integrated purpose-built cloud-native and AI-observability suite solves a huge pain point for forward-thinking C-suite leaders who demand the very best across their entire observability stack.\"Similarly, JJ Tang, CEO and founder of Rootly, emphasized the incident resolution benefits. \"Incidents hinder innovation and revenue, and the challenge lies in sifting through vast amounts of observability data, mobilizing teams, and resolving issues quickly,\" Tang said. \"Integrating Chronosphere with Rootly allows engineers to collaborate with context and resolve issues faster within their existing communication channels, drastically reducing time to resolution and ultimately improving reliability—78% plus decreases in repeat Sev0 and Sev1 incidents.\"When asked how total costs compare when customers use multiple partner contracts versus a single platform, Mao acknowledged the current complexity. \"At present, mutual customers typically maintain separate contracts unless they engage through a services partner or system integrator,\" he said. However, he argued the economics still favor the composable approach: \"Our combined technologies deliver exceptional value—in most circumstances at just a fraction of the price of a single-platform solution. Beyond the savings, customers gain a richer, more unified observability experience that unlocks deeper insights and greater efficiency, especially for large-scale environments.\"The company plans to streamline this over time. \"As the ISV program matures, we&#x27;re focused on delivering a more streamlined experience by transitioning to a single, unified contract that simplifies procurement and accelerates time to value,\" Mao said.How two Uber engineers turned Halloween outages into a billion-dollar startupChronosphere&#x27;s origins trace to 2019, when Mao and co-founder Rob Skillington left Uber after building the ride-hailing giant&#x27;s internal observability platform. At Uber, Mao&#x27;s team had faced a crisis: the company&#x27;s in-house tools would fail on its two busiest nights — Halloween and New Year&#x27;s Eve — cutting off visibility into whether customers could request rides or drivers could locate passengers.The solution they built at Uber used open-source software and ultimately allowed the company to operate without outages, even during high-volume events. But the broader market insight came at an industry conference in December 2018, when major cloud providers threw their weight behind Kubernetes, Google&#x27;s container orchestration technology.\"This meant that most technology architectures were eventually going to look like Uber&#x27;s,\" Mao recalled in an August 2024 profile by Greylock Partners, Chronosphere&#x27;s lead investor. \"And that meant every company, not just a few big tech companies and the Walmarts of the world, would have the exact same problem we had solved at Uber.\"Chronosphere has since raised more than $343 million in funding across multiple rounds led by Greylock, Lux Capital, General Atlantic, Addition, and Founders Fund. The company operates as a remote-first organization with offices in New York, Austin, Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, employing approximately 299 people according to LinkedIn data.The company&#x27;s customer base includes DoorDash, Zillow, Snap, Robinhood, and Affirm — predominantly high-growth technology companies operating cloud-native, Kubernetes-based infrastructures at massive scale.What&#x27;s available now—and what enterprises can expect in 2026Chronosphere&#x27;s AI-Guided Troubleshooting capabilities, including Suggestions and Investigation Notebooks, entered limited availability Monday with select customers. The company plans full general availability in 2026. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server, which enables engineers to integrate Chronosphere directly into internal AI workflows and query observability data through AI-enabled development environments, is available immediately for all Chronosphere customers.The phased rollout reflects the company&#x27;s cautious approach to deploying AI in production environments where mistakes carry real costs. By gathering feedback from early adopters before broad release, Chronosphere aims to refine its guidance algorithms and validate that its suggestions genuinely accelerate troubleshooting rather than simply generating impressive demonstrations.The longer game, however, extends beyond individual product features. Chronosphere&#x27;s dual bet — on transparent AI that shows its reasoning and on a partner ecosystem rather than all-in-one integration — amounts to a fundamental thesis about how enterprise observability will evolve as systems grow more complex.If that thesis proves correct, the company that solves observability for the AI age won&#x27;t be the one with the most automated black box. It will be the one that earns engineers&#x27; trust by explaining what it knows, admitting what it doesn&#x27;t, and letting humans make the final call. In an industry drowning in data and promised silver bullets, Chronosphere is wagering that showing your work still matters — even when AI is doing the math.",

          "standfirst": "As cloud project tracking software monday.com’s engineering organization scaled past 500 developers, the team began to feel the strain of its own success. Product lines were multiplying, microservices proliferating, and code was flowing faster than human reviewers could keep up. The company needed a way to review thousands of pull requests each month without drowning developers in tedium — or letting quality slip.That’s when Guy Regev, VP of R&D and head of the Growth and monday Dev teams, started experimenting with a new AI tool from Qodo, an Israeli startup focused on developer agents. What began as a lightweight test soon became a critical part of monday.com’s software delivery infrastructure, as a new case study released by both Qodo and monday.com today reveals. “Qodo doesn’t feel like just another tool—it’s like adding a new developer to the team who actually learns how we work,\" Regev told VentureBeat in a recent video call interview, adding that it has \"prevented over 800 issues per month from reaching production—some of them could have caused serious security vulnerabilities.\"Unlike code generation tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, Qodo isn’t trying to write new code. Instead, it specializes in reviewing it — using what it calls context engineering to understand not just what changed in a pull request, but why, how it aligns with business logic, and whether it follows internal best practices. \"You can call Claude Code or Cursor and in five minutes get 1,000 lines of code,\" said Itamar Friedman, co-founder and CEO of Qodo, in the same video call interview as with Regev. \"You have 40 minutes, and you can&#x27;t review that. So you need Qodo to actually review it.”For monday.com, this capability wasn’t just helpful — it was transformative.Code Review, at ScaleAt any given time, monday.com’s developers are shipping updates across hundreds of repositories and services. The engineering org works in tightly coordinated teams, each aligned with specific parts of the product: marketing, CRM, dev tools, internal platforms, and more.That’s where Qodo came in. The company’s platform uses AI not just to check for obvious bugs or style violations, but to evaluate whether a pull request follows team-specific conventions, architectural guidelines, and historical patterns. It does this by learning from your own codebase — training on previous PRs, comments, merges, and even Slack threads to understand how your team works.\"The comments Qodo gives aren’t generic—they reflect our values, our libraries, even our standards for things like feature flags and privacy,\" Regev said. \"It’s context-aware in a way traditional tools aren’t.\"What “Context Engineering” Actually MeansQodo calls its secret sauce context engineering — a system-level approach to managing everything the model sees when making a decision. This includes the PR code diff, of course, but also prior discussions, documentation, relevant files from the repo, even test results and configuration data.The idea is that language models don’t really “think” — they predict the next token based on the inputs they’re given. So the quality of their output depends almost entirely on the quality and structure of their inputs.As Dana Fine, Qodo’s community manager, put it in a blog post: “You’re not just writing prompts; you’re designing structured input under a fixed token limit. Every token is a design decision.”This isn’t just theory. In monday.com’s case, it meant Qodo could catch not only the obvious bugs, but the subtle ones that typically slip past human reviewers — hardcoded variables, missing fallbacks, or violations of cross-team architecture conventions.One example stood out. In a recent PR, Qodo flagged a line that inadvertently exposed a staging environment variable — something no human reviewer caught. Had it been merged, it might have caused problems in production. \"The hours we would spend on fixing this security leak and the legal issue that it would bring would be much more than the hours that we reduce from a pull-request,\" said Regev.Integration into the PipelineToday, Qodo is deeply integrated into monday.com’s development workflow, analyzing pull requests and surfacing context-aware recommendations based on prior team code reviews. “It doesn’t feel like just another tool... It feels like another teammate that joined the system — one who learns how we work,\" Regev noted. Developers receive suggestions during the review process and remain in control of final decisions — a human-in-the-loop model that was critical for adoption.Because Qodo integrated directly into GitHub via pull request actions and comments, Monday.com’s infrastructure team didn’t face a steep learning curve.“It’s just a GitHub action,” said Regev. “It creates a PR with the tests. It’s not like a separate tool we had to learn.”“The purpose is to actually help the developer learn the code, take ownership, give feedback to each other, and learn from that and establish the standards,\" added Friedman.The Results: Time Saved, Bugs PreventedSince rolling out Qodo more broadly, monday.com has seen measurable improvements across multiple teams.Internal analysis shows that developers save roughly an hour per pull request on average. Multiply that across thousands of PRs per month, and the savings quickly reach thousands of developer hours annually.These aren’t just cosmetic issues — many relate to business logic, security, or runtime stability. And because Qodo’s suggestions reflect monday.com’s actual conventions, developers are more likely to act on them.The system’s accuracy is rooted in its data-first design. Qodo trains on each company’s private codebase and historical data, adapting to different team styles and practices. It doesn’t rely on one-size-fits-all rules or external datasets. Everything is tailored.From Internal Tool to Product VisionRegev’s team was so impressed with Qodo’s impact that they’ve started planning deeper integrations between Qodo and Monday Dev, the developer-focused product line monday.com is building.The vision is to create a workflow where business context — tasks, tickets, customer feedback — flows directly into the code review layer. That way, reviewers can assess not just whether the code “works,” but whether it solves the right problem.“Before, we had linters, danger rules, static analysis... rule-based... you need to configure all the rules,\" Regev said. \"But it doesn’t know what you don’t know... Qodo... feels like it’s learning from our engineers.”This aligns closely with Qodo’s own roadmap. The company doesn’t just review code. It’s building a full platform of developer agents — including Qodo Gen for context-aware code generation, Qodo Merge for automated PR analysis, and Qodo Cover, a regression-testing agent that uses runtime validation to ensure test coverage.All of this is powered by Qodo’s own infrastructure, including its new open-source embedding model, Qodo-Embed-1-1.5B, which outperformed offerings from OpenAI and Salesforce on code retrieval benchmarks.What’s Next?Qodo is now offering its platform under a freemium model — free for individuals, discounted for startups through Google Cloud’s Perks program, and enterprise-grade for companies that need SSO, air-gapped deployment, or advanced controls.The company is already working with teams at NVIDIA, Intuit, and other Fortune 500 companies. And thanks to a recent partnership with Google Cloud, Qodo’s models are available directly inside Vertex AI’s Model Garden, making it easier to integrate into enterprise pipelines.\"Context engines will be the big story of 2026,\" Friedman said. \"Every enterprise will need to build their own second brain if they want AI that actually understands and helps them.\"As AI systems become more embedded in software development, tools like Qodo are showing how the right context — delivered at the right moment — can transform how teams build, ship, and scale code across the enterprise.",

          "title": "The Logitech MX Master 4 comes with haptic feedback, less rubber and the same general shape",
          "standfirst": "Editor’s note (11/10/25): After spending another month with the MX Master 4, our impressions remain largely unchanged. The new textured plastic finish and silicone thumb rest have shown no signs of wear, and we’ve continued to see no erratic behavior with the electromagnetic scroll wheel. Battery life still lines up with Logitech’s rating, while the haptic feedback and Actions Ring functionality remain useful if inessential. We’ve added an official review score to this post as a result. Our original hands-on is below. Original post (9/30/25): If you’ve shopped around for a wireless mouse at any point in the past decade, you’ve probably seen lots of people recommending a Logitech MX Master. There’s good reason for that: They aren’t cheap, but they’re usually comfortable, versatile and loaded with features designed to make working in front of a monitor all day a little less annoying. The current MX Master 3S has sat at the top of our own wireless mouse buying guide for some time now. Now, three years after releasing the 3S, Logitech is rolling out the new MX Master 4, which costs $120 and will ship in October. I’ve been able to test it out for the past few weeks. For the most part, this is an iterative update, with the same general shape, battery life, 8K DPI sensor and ultra-quiet clicks as the MX Master 3S before it. It is a touch heavier (150 grams vs. 141g), wider (3.48 inches vs 3.32 in.) and taller (5.05 inches vs. 4.92 in.) than the last model, and the main click buttons are slightly larger. But if you found the 3S or older MX Master 3 comfortable, you should have few issues here. That said, this is still a hefty mouse designed for palm grippers and right-handed users: Its gentle contours, generous hump, ample thumb rest and large buttons will fit like a glove if that describes you, but lefties and those with especially petite hands won’t agree. The flashiest change here is the addition of haptic feedback, which is built into a small panel within the mouse’s thumb rest. You can customize the intensity of this effect through Logitech’s Options+ software — or turn it off entirely — but it essentially brings a modicum of smartphone-style feedback to your desktop. When you first pair the mouse, for one, you’ll feel a little bump. The same goes if you move between devices using Logitech’s “Flow” feature. When battery is low, it’ll vibrate. If you’re trying to precisely line up a graphic in an app like Photoshop, you’ll get a little buzz when you’ve moved it to the exact right spot. Jeff Dunn for Engadget You’ll also feel it when you hover over options in the Actions Ring, a customizable overlay that presents different shortcuts depending on the app you’re using. This pops up when you click the side panel; you could use it quickly access the screenshot tool while in Chrome, for instance, or the brightness and contrast sliders in Photoshop. If all of this sounds like a gimmick, well, yeah it kind of is. It’s not the kind of thing anyone needs. But the effect is surprisingly subtle on the default “medium” setting, and there’s a level of reassurance that comes with feeling a confirmed action instead of just seeing it. I found it more pleasant than distracting. The catch is that only a few apps will natively support the MX Master 4’s haptics at launch: Photoshop, Lightroom and Zoom, with Adobe Premiere Pro to follow soon after. You’ll still be able to utilize the haptic feedback on a system level on Windows and macOS, and Logitech is releasing an SDK for more developers to integrate the functionality, but we’ll have to see how many do so. Another change is with the mouse’s coating, which trades the 3S’ rubbery finish for a lightly textured plastic around the top. (The thumb rest area and right side still use a denser rubber.) Some users have complained about older MX Master mice peeling and wearing down after extended use; time will tell how well the new model holds up, but it should avoid the same sort of sweat-induced degradation. Either way, I’ve found it smooth to the touch without being slippery. I also haven’t been able to replicate the accuracy issues some 3S buyers have had with that mouse’s electromagnetic scroll wheel, which is still made of a high-quality metal and lets you conveniently swap between a notched and free-spin scroll on the fly. Customizing the Actions Ring in Logitech's Options+ app. Logitech/Jeff Dunn for Engadget There are other minor tweaks and improvements. The receiver included with the Windows model is now USB-C instead of USB-A. The horizontal scroll wheel on the side — which remains a blessing for navigating spreadsheets — is now more exposed and extends a little farther with each spin. The PTFE feet on the bottom are a bit larger for a smoother glide. The dedicated gesture button is no longer awkwardly integrated into the thumb rest; instead, it’s been pulled out ahead of the two programmable side buttons. Logitech says there’s a more powerful chip inside the mouse to improve connection quality. The edges around the main click buttons are now translucent: nothing major, but a bit more stylish. The screws on the bottom are now exposed, too, which Logitech says should be helpful for recycling purposes down the road. The rest is largely the same as before, which isn’t a bad thing. The best feature here is still the virtually silent main buttons, which keep a pleasing level of travel but will never bother anyone around you. Battery life is still rated at a solid 70 days, which seems about right — I haven’t charged the mouse in about a month and the Options+ app says I still have about 50 percent juice left. The design still feels super sturdy, with no flexing or creaking. The side buttons feel firm and tactile. Options+ is resource-heavy but still intuitive enough for reprogramming buttons and customizing app-specific settings. It can still track on a variety of surfaces, including glass or the fabric of my couch. You can still connect to three devices simultaneously and switch between them with a button on the bottom, too. Logitech On the downside, there’s no USB-C cable included in the box anymore, and the polling rate is still set at a basic 125Hz, which means tracking isn’t quite as buttery smooth as it could be. (Though you'd never want to use something this heavy for gaming.) The Mac version doesn’t come with a USB receiver, and there’s still no built-in storage compartment for the dongle with either model. You also need to keep Options+ open to feel the haptic feedback, which is annoying, especially if your work limits use of third-party software. Some of those complaints have been issues for a while, so it’s frustrating to see them three years later. Still, they’re probably not dealbreakers. The MX Master 4 may not be a essential upgrade if you’re happy with an older MX Master mouse, and if those didn’t work for you before, this one probably won’t work for you now. But if you’re a power user in the market for a new productivity mouse, we’d expect this newest iteration to be as popular as its predecessors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-logitech-mx-master-4-comes-with-haptic-feedback-less-rubber-and-the-same-general-shape-070129482.html?src=rss",

When you first pair the mouse, for one, you’ll feel a little bump. The same goes if you move between devices using Logitech’s “Flow” feature. When battery is low, it’ll vibrate. If you’re trying to precisely line up a graphic in an app like Photoshop, you’ll get a little buzz when you’ve moved it to the exact right spot. Jeff Dunn for Engadget You’ll also feel it when you hover over options in the Actions Ring, a customizable overlay that presents different shortcuts depending on the app you’re using. This pops up when you click the side panel; you could use it quickly access the screenshot tool while in Chrome, for instance, or the brightness and contrast sliders in Photoshop. If all of this sounds like a gimmick, well, yeah it kind of is. It’s not the kind of thing anyone needs. But the effect is surprisingly subtle on the default “medium” setting, and there’s a level of reassurance that comes with feeling a confirmed action instead of just seeing it. I found it more pleasant than distracting. The catch is that only a few apps will natively support the MX Master 4’s haptics at launch: Photoshop, Lightroom and Zoom, with Adobe Premiere Pro to follow soon after. You’ll still be able to utilize the haptic feedback on a system level on Windows and macOS, and Logitech is releasing an SDK for more developers to integrate the functionality, but we’ll have to see how many do so. Another change is with the mouse’s coating, which trades the 3S’ rubbery finish for a lightly textured plastic around the top. (The thumb rest area and right side still use a denser rubber.) Some users have complained about older MX Master mice peeling and wearing down after extended use; time will tell how well the new model holds up, but it should avoid the same sort of sweat-induced degradation. Either way, I’ve found it smooth to the touch without being slippery. I also haven’t been able to replicate the accuracy issues some 3S buyers have had with that mouse’s electromagnetic scroll wheel, which is still made of a high-quality metal and lets you conveniently swap between a notched and free-spin scroll on the fly. Customizing the Actions Ring in Logitech's Options+ app. Logitech/Jeff Dunn for Engadget There are other minor tweaks and improvements. The receiver included with the Windows model is now USB-C instead of USB-A. The horizontal scroll wheel on the side — which remains a blessing for navigating spreadsheets — is now more exposed and extends a little farther with each spin. The PTFE feet on the bottom are a bit larger for a smoother glide. The dedicated gesture button is no longer awkwardly integrated into the thumb rest; instead, it’s been pulled out ahead of the two programmable side buttons. Logitech says there’s a more powerful chip inside the mouse to improve connection quality. The edges around the main click buttons are now translucent: nothing major, but a bit more stylish. The screws on the bottom are now exposed, too, which Logitech says should be helpful for recycling purposes down the road. The rest is largely the same as before, which isn’t a bad thing. The best feature here is still the virtually silent main buttons, which keep a pleasing level of travel but will never bother anyone around you. Battery life is still rated at a solid 70 days, which seems about right — I haven’t charged the mouse in about a month and the Options+ app says I still have about 50 percent juice left. The design still feels super sturdy, with no flexing or creaking. The side buttons feel firm and tactile. Options+ is resource-heavy but still intuitive enough for reprogramming buttons and customizing app-specific settings. It can still track on a variety of surfaces, including glass or the fabric of my couch. You can still connect to three devices simultaneously and switch between them with a button on the bottom, too. Logitech On the downside, there’s no USB-C cable included in the box anymore, and the polling rate is still set at a basic 125Hz, which means tracking isn’t quite as buttery smooth as it could be. (Though you'd never want to use something this heavy for gaming.) The Mac version doesn’t come with a USB receiver, and there’s still no built-in storage compartment for the dongle with either model. You also need to keep Options+ open to feel the haptic feedback, which is annoying, especially if your work limits use of third-party software. Some of those complaints have been issues for a while, so it’s frustrating to see them three years later. Still, they’re probably not dealbreakers. The MX Master 4 may not be a essential upgrade if you’re happy with an older MX Master mouse, and if those didn’t work for you before, this one probably won’t work for you now. But if you’re a power user in the market for a new productivity mouse, we’d expect this newest iteration to be as popular as its predecessors.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-logitech-mx-master-4-comes-with-haptic-feedback-less-rubber-and-the-same-general-shape-070129482.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Baseten, the AI infrastructure company recently valued at $2.15 billion, is making its most significant product pivot yet: a full-scale push into model training that could reshape how enterprises wean themselves off dependence on OpenAI and other closed-source AI providers.The San Francisco-based company announced Thursday the general availability of Baseten Training, an infrastructure platform designed to help companies fine-tune open-source AI models without the operational headaches of managing GPU clusters, multi-node orchestration, or cloud capacity planning. The move is a calculated expansion beyond Baseten&#x27;s core inference business, driven by what CTO Amir Haghighat describes as relentless customer demand and a strategic imperative to capture the full lifecycle of AI deployment.\"We had a captive audience of customers who kept coming to us saying, &#x27;Hey, I hate this problem,&#x27;\" Haghighat said in an interview. \"One of them told me, &#x27;Look, I bought a bunch of H100s from a cloud provider. I have to SSH in on Friday, run my fine-tuning job, then check on Monday to see if it worked. Sometimes I realize it just hasn&#x27;t been working all along.&#x27;\"The launch comes at a critical inflection point in enterprise AI adoption. As open-source models from Meta, Alibaba, and others increasingly rival proprietary systems in performance, companies face mounting pressure to reduce their reliance on expensive API calls to services like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 or Anthropic&#x27;s Claude. But the path from off-the-shelf open-source model to production-ready custom AI remains treacherous, requiring specialized expertise in machine learning operations, infrastructure management, and performance optimization.Baseten&#x27;s answer: provide the infrastructure rails while letting companies retain full control over their training code, data, and model weights. It&#x27;s a deliberately low-level approach born from hard-won lessons.How a failed product taught Baseten what AI training infrastructure really needsThis isn&#x27;t Baseten&#x27;s first foray into training. The company&#x27;s previous attempt, a product called Blueprints launched roughly two and a half years ago, failed spectacularly — a failure Haghighat now embraces as instructive.\"We had created the abstraction layer a little too high,\" he explained. \"We were trying to create a magical experience, where as a user, you come in and programmatically choose a base model, choose your data and some hyperparameters, and magically out comes a model.\"The problem? Users didn&#x27;t have the intuition to make the right choices about base models, data quality, or hyperparameters. When their models underperformed, they blamed the product. Baseten found itself in the consulting business rather than the infrastructure business, helping customers debug everything from dataset deduplication to model selection.\"We became consultants,\" Haghighat said. \"And that&#x27;s not what we had set out to do.\"Baseten killed Blueprints and refocused entirely on inference, vowing to \"earn the right\" to expand again. That moment arrived earlier this year, driven by two market realities: the vast majority of Baseten&#x27;s inference revenue comes from custom models that customers train elsewhere, and competing training platforms were using restrictive terms of service to lock customers into their inference products.\"Multiple companies who were building fine-tuning products had in their terms of service that you as a customer cannot take the weights of the fine-tuned model with you somewhere else,\" Haghighat said. \"I understand why from their perspective — I still don&#x27;t think there is a big company to be made purely on just training or fine-tuning. The sticky part is in inference, the valuable part where value is unlocked is in inference, and ultimately the revenue is in inference.\"Baseten took the opposite approach: customers own their weights and can download them at will. The bet is that superior inference performance will keep them on the platform anyway.Multi-cloud GPU orchestration and sub-minute scheduling set Baseten apart from hyperscalersThe new Baseten Training product operates at what Haghighat calls \"the infrastructure layer\" — lower-level than the failed Blueprints experiment, but with opinionated tooling around reliability, observability, and integration with Baseten&#x27;s inference stack.Key technical capabilities include multi-node training support across clusters of NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPUs, automated checkpointing to protect against node failures, sub-minute job scheduling, and integration with Baseten&#x27;s proprietary Multi-Cloud Management (MCM) system. That last piece is critical: MCM allows Baseten to dynamically provision GPU capacity across multiple cloud providers and regions, passing cost savings to customers while avoiding the capacity constraints and multi-year contracts typical of hyperscaler deals.\"With hyperscalers, you don&#x27;t get to say, &#x27;Hey, give me three or four B200 nodes while my job is running, and then take it back from me and don&#x27;t charge me for it,&#x27;\" Haghighat said. \"They say, &#x27;No, you need to sign a three-year contract.&#x27; We don&#x27;t do that.\"Baseten&#x27;s approach mirrors broader trends in cloud infrastructure, where abstraction layers increasingly allow workloads to move fluidly across providers. When AWS experienced a major outage several weeks ago, Baseten&#x27;s inference services remained operational by automatically routing traffic to other cloud providers — a capability now extended to training workloads.The technical differentiation extends to Baseten&#x27;s observability tooling, which provides per-GPU metrics for multi-node jobs, granular checkpoint tracking, and a refreshed UI that surfaces infrastructure-level events. The company also introduced an \"ML Cookbook\" of open-source training recipes for popular models like Gemma, GPT OSS, and Qwen, designed to help users reach \"training success\" faster.Early adopters report 84% cost savings and 50% latency improvements with custom modelsTwo early customers illustrate the market Baseten is targeting: AI-native companies building specialized vertical solutions that require custom models.Oxen AI, a platform focused on dataset management and model fine-tuning, exemplifies the partnership model Baseten envisions. CEO Greg Schoeninger articulated a common strategic calculus, telling VentureBeat: \"Whenever I&#x27;ve seen a platform try to do both hardware and software, they usually fail at one of them. That&#x27;s why partnering with Baseten to handle infrastructure was the obvious choice.\"Oxen built its customer experience entirely on top of Baseten&#x27;s infrastructure, using the Baseten CLI to programmatically orchestrate training jobs. The system automatically provisions and deprovisions GPUs, fully concealing Baseten&#x27;s interface behind Oxen&#x27;s own. For one Oxen customer, AlliumAI — a startup bringing structure to messy retail data — the integration delivered 84% cost savings compared to previous approaches, reducing total inference costs from $46,800 to $7,530.\"Training custom LoRAs has always been one of the most effective ways to leverage open-source models, but it often came with infrastructure headaches,\" said Daniel Demillard, CEO of AlliumAI. \"With Oxen and Baseten, that complexity disappears. We can train and deploy models at massive scale without ever worrying about CUDA, which GPU to choose, or shutting down servers after training.\"Parsed, another early customer, tackles a different pain point: helping enterprises reduce dependence on OpenAI by creating specialized models that outperform generalist LLMs on domain-specific tasks. The company works in mission-critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal services, where model performance and reliability aren&#x27;t negotiable.\"Prior to switching to Baseten, we were seeing repetitive and degraded performance on our fine-tuned models due to bugs with our previous training provider,\" said Charles O&#x27;Neill, Parsed&#x27;s co-founder and chief science officer. \"On top of that, we were struggling to easily download and checkpoint weights after training runs.\"With Baseten, Parsed achieved 50% lower end-to-end latency for transcription use cases, spun up HIPAA-compliant EU deployments for testing within 48 hours, and kicked off more than 500 training jobs. The company also leveraged Baseten&#x27;s modified vLLM inference framework and speculative decoding — a technique that generates draft tokens to accelerate language model output — to cut latency in half for custom models.\"Fast models matter,\" O&#x27;Neill said. \"But fast models that get better over time matter more. A model that&#x27;s 2x faster but static loses to one that&#x27;s slightly slower but improving 10% monthly. Baseten gives us both — the performance edge today and the infrastructure for continuous improvement.\"Why training and inference are more interconnected than the industry realizesThe Parsed example illuminates a deeper strategic rationale for Baseten&#x27;s training expansion: the boundary between training and inference is blurrier than conventional wisdom suggests.Baseten&#x27;s model performance team uses the training platform extensively to create \"draft models\" for speculative decoding, a cutting-edge technique that can dramatically accelerate inference. The company recently announced it achieved 650+ tokens per second on OpenAI&#x27;s GPT OSS 120B model — a 60% improvement over its launch performance — using EAGLE-3 speculative decoding, which requires training specialized small models to work alongside larger target models.\"Ultimately, inference and training plug in more ways than one might think,\" Haghighat said. \"When you do speculative decoding in inference, you need to train the draft model. Our model performance team is a big customer of the training product to train these EAGLE heads on a continuous basis.\"This technical interdependence reinforces Baseten&#x27;s thesis that owning both training and inference creates defensible value. The company can optimize the entire lifecycle: a model trained on Baseten can be deployed with a single click to inference endpoints pre-optimized for that architecture, with deployment-from-checkpoint support for chat completion and audio transcription workloads.The approach contrasts sharply with vertically integrated competitors like Replicate or Modal, which also offer training and inference but with different architectural tradeoffs. Baseten&#x27;s bet is on lower-level infrastructure flexibility and performance optimization, particularly for companies running custom models at scale.As open-source AI models improve, enterprises see fine-tuning as the path away from OpenAI dependencyUnderpinning Baseten&#x27;s entire strategy is a conviction about the trajectory of open-source AI models — namely, that they&#x27;re getting good enough, fast enough, to unlock massive enterprise adoption through fine-tuning.\"Both closed and open-source models are getting better and better in terms of quality,\" Haghighat said. \"We don&#x27;t even need open source to surpass closed models, because as both of them are getting better, they unlock all these invisible lines of usefulness for different use cases.\"He pointed to the proliferation of reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning techniques that allow companies to take an open-source model and make it \"as good as the closed model, not at everything, but at this narrow band of capability that they want.\"That trend is already visible in Baseten&#x27;s Model APIs business, launched alongside Training earlier this year to provide production-grade access to open-source models. The company was the first provider to offer access to DeepSeek V3 and R1, and has since added models like Llama 4 and Qwen 3, optimized for performance and reliability. Model APIs serves as a top-of-funnel product: companies start with off-the-shelf open-source models, realize they need customization, move to Training for fine-tuning, and ultimately deploy on Baseten&#x27;s Dedicated Deployments infrastructure.Yet Haghighat acknowledged the market remains \"fuzzy\" around which training techniques will dominate. Baseten is hedging by staying close to the bleeding edge through its Forward Deployed Engineering team, which works hands-on with select customers on reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and other advanced techniques.\"As we do that, we will see patterns emerge about what a productized training product can look like that really addresses the user&#x27;s needs without them having to learn too much about how RL works,\" he said. \"Are we there as an industry? I would say not quite. I see some attempts at that, but they all seem like almost falling to the same trap that Blueprints fell into—a bit of a walled garden that ties the hands of AI folks behind their back.\"The roadmap ahead includes potential abstractions for common training patterns, expansion into image, audio, and video fine-tuning, and deeper integration of advanced techniques like prefill-decode disaggregation, which separates the initial processing of prompts from token generation to improve efficiency.Baseten faces crowded field but bets developer experience and performance will win enterprise customersBaseten enters an increasingly crowded market for AI infrastructure. Hyperscalers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer GPU compute for training, while specialized providers like Lambda Labs, CoreWeave, and Together AI compete on price, performance, or ease of use. Then there are vertically integrated platforms like Hugging Face, Replicate, and Modal that bundle training, inference, and model hosting.Baseten&#x27;s differentiation rests on three pillars: its MCM system for multi-cloud capacity management, deep performance optimization expertise built from its inference business, and a developer experience tailored for production deployments rather than experimentation.The company&#x27;s recent $150 million Series D and $2.15 billion valuation provide runway to invest in both products simultaneously. Major customers include Descript, which uses Baseten for transcription workloads; Decagon, which runs customer service AI; and Sourcegraph, which powers coding assistants. All three operate in domains where model customization and performance are competitive advantages.Timing may be Baseten&#x27;s biggest asset. The confluence of improving open-source models, enterprise discomfort with dependence on proprietary AI providers, and growing sophistication around fine-tuning techniques creates what Haghighat sees as a sustainable market shift.\"There is a lot of use cases for which closed models have gotten there and open ones have not,\" he said. \"Where I&#x27;m seeing in the market is people using different training techniques — more recently, a lot of reinforcement learning and SFT — to be able to get this open model to be as good as the closed model, not at everything, but at this narrow band of capability that they want. That&#x27;s very palpable in the market.\"For enterprises navigating the complex transition from closed to open AI models, Baseten&#x27;s positioning offers a clear value proposition: infrastructure that handles the messy middle of fine-tuning while optimizing for the ultimate goal of performant, reliable, cost-effective inference at scale. The company&#x27;s insistence that customers own their model weights — a stark contrast to competitors using training as a lock-in mechanism — reflects confidence that technical excellence, not contractual restrictions, will drive retention.Whether Baseten can execute on this vision depends on navigating tensions inherent in its strategy: staying at the infrastructure layer without becoming consultants, providing power and flexibility without overwhelming users with complexity, and building abstractions at exactly the right level as the market matures. The company&#x27;s willingness to kill Blueprints when it failed suggests a pragmatism that could prove decisive in a market where many infrastructure providers over-promise and under-deliver.\"Through and through, we&#x27;re an inference company,\" Haghighat emphasized. \"The reason that we did training is at the service of inference.\"That clarity of purpose — treating training as a means to an end rather than an end in itself—may be Baseten&#x27;s most important strategic asset. As AI deployment matures from experimentation to production, the companies that solve the full stack stand to capture outsized value. But only if they avoid the trap of technology in search of a problem.At least Baseten&#x27;s customers no longer have to SSH into boxes on Friday and pray their training jobs complete by Monday. In the infrastructure business, sometimes the best innovation is simply making the painful parts disappear.",

Then there are vertically integrated platforms like Hugging Face, Replicate, and Modal that bundle training, inference, and model hosting.Baseten&#x27;s differentiation rests on three pillars: its MCM system for multi-cloud capacity management, deep performance optimization expertise built from its inference business, and a developer experience tailored for production deployments rather than experimentation.The company&#x27;s recent $150 million Series D and $2.15 billion valuation provide runway to invest in both products simultaneously. Major customers include Descript, which uses Baseten for transcription workloads; Decagon, which runs customer service AI; and Sourcegraph, which powers coding assistants. All three operate in domains where model customization and performance are competitive advantages.Timing may be Baseten&#x27;s biggest asset. The confluence of improving open-source models, enterprise discomfort with dependence on proprietary AI providers, and growing sophistication around fine-tuning techniques creates what Haghighat sees as a sustainable market shift.\"There is a lot of use cases for which closed models have gotten there and open ones have not,\" he said. \"Where I&#x27;m seeing in the market is people using different training techniques — more recently, a lot of reinforcement learning and SFT — to be able to get this open model to be as good as the closed model, not at everything, but at this narrow band of capability that they want. That&#x27;s very palpable in the market.\"For enterprises navigating the complex transition from closed to open AI models, Baseten&#x27;s positioning offers a clear value proposition: infrastructure that handles the messy middle of fine-tuning while optimizing for the ultimate goal of performant, reliable, cost-effective inference at scale. The company&#x27;s insistence that customers own their model weights — a stark contrast to competitors using training as a lock-in mechanism — reflects confidence that technical excellence, not contractual restrictions, will drive retention.Whether Baseten can execute on this vision depends on navigating tensions inherent in its strategy: staying at the infrastructure layer without becoming consultants, providing power and flexibility without overwhelming users with complexity, and building abstractions at exactly the right level as the market matures. The company&#x27;s willingness to kill Blueprints when it failed suggests a pragmatism that could prove decisive in a market where many infrastructure providers over-promise and under-deliver.\"Through and through, we&#x27;re an inference company,\" Haghighat emphasized. \"The reason that we did training is at the service of inference.\"That clarity of purpose — treating training as a means to an end rather than an end in itself—may be Baseten&#x27;s most important strategic asset. As AI deployment matures from experimentation to production, the companies that solve the full stack stand to capture outsized value. But only if they avoid the trap of technology in search of a problem.At least Baseten&#x27;s customers no longer have to SSH into boxes on Friday and pray their training jobs complete by Monday. In the infrastructure business, sometimes the best innovation is simply making the painful parts disappear.",

          "standfirst": "It's a good idea to look for Black Friday Apple deals this time of year if you're thinking about upgrading an aging laptop or picking up a pair of AirPods or an Apple Watch as a gift. One of the best discounts we're tracking at the moment is on the M4-powered Mac Mini desktop — it's $100 off right now, down from $599 to $499. That applies to the 16GB of RAM/256GB SSD model, and it's pretty close to its all-time-low price. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "title": "Apple Watch SE 3 review: Good enough for most people",
          "standfirst": "I started my review of the Apple Watch Series 11 talking about how everyone uses smartwatches differently. And based on your needs, the right Apple Watch might not be the one with the most features. The Apple Watch SE series has long been the option for parents to buy for their kids or other dependents, or people who are dipping their toe into the world of smartwatches. But with the introduction of an always-on-display (AOD), on-device Siri and faster charging, the Apple Watch SE 3 has shed most of its limitations and may well be good enough for most people. Throw in an onboard temperature sensor, support for 5G, media playback and gestures like double tap and wrist flick, and the latest Watch SE is not only a serious upgrade over its predecessor but also a compelling option for pretty much anyone. I used the SE 3 for a few weeks to see if it’s good enough to replace the Apple Watch Series 11 I regularly wear, and, setting aside some small caveats, the short answer is yes. What’s new in the Apple Watch SE 3? The most important upgrades in this generation of the entry-level smartwatch are the arrival of the always-on-display, faster charging speeds and on-device Siri. That latter addition allowed me to ask the assistant to start workouts, reply to messages or check the weather without having to deal with the tiny buttons on the cramped screen. You’ll also be able to dismiss notifications and alarms with a flick of your wrist, or use the double tap gesture to navigate the smart stack and select or confirm items onscreen. Older models of the Watch SE would not only require a connection to your iPhone to work with Siri, but those requests would also be a lot slower since the system would need to wait for the phone to deliver the answer. I also loathed how long it took for earlier Apple Watches to charge, and in my testing the Watch SE 3’s speed comes closer to more recent models like the Series 7 and newer. It still took noticeably more time to recharge than the Series 11, but it’s not slow enough to be a dealbreaker. You’ll just need to establish some sort of charging routine that allows at least a few hours for the Watch SE 3 to get back to 100 percent. An always-on-display is something I missed when I tested the Watch SE 2, because I’m the sort of gym fiend that likes to be able to quickly glance at my wrist while pumping some pushups and see exactly what my heart rate is. Without AOD, you’d need to raise your wrist or wake the screen somehow to see your stats, which is annoying if you’re in the middle of a workout or are lugging heavy weights around. The Watch SE 3 delivered basically the same experience as the Series 11 when I wore both to my resistance and HIIT (high intensity interval training) sessions, though the latter’s larger display did make it easier to read my stats. Speaking of the screen, the Watch SE 3 hasn’t gotten any brighter, with its peak of 1,000 nits being the same as the SE 2’s. But the latest SE can get as dim as 2 nits, which is very close to the Series 11’s 1 nit. You may wonder why this is worth noting, but trust me — your retinas will be grateful when you accidentally raise your wrist or get a notification in the middle of the night or are in a darkened theater. Older smartwatches were pretty disruptive in cinemas since their screens were bright enough to scorch any eyeballs that were accustomed to low-light environments. The Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3 side by side on the same forearm. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Another screen-related update that isn’t immediately obvious is the Ion-X glass on the SE 3, which Apple says is four times more crack-resistant than the SE 2. I haven’t put this claim to the test, but the hardier material should help keep your smartwatch safe from more mishaps. I should also point out that the Watch SE 3 uses the same S10 processor as the Series 11, which has a four-core neural engine that should help speed up Siri and Apple Intelligence tasks. In general, I found the SE 3 snappy and responsive, and mostly as fast as the Series 11. Previous Watch SE models tended to be a bit sluggish, so it’s nice to see the SE 3 get this particular bump. The impact of most of the other improvements to the SE 3 depend on how you use a smartwatch. The new 5G support, for example, would be helpful if you get a cellular model and want to leave your phone behind while you run errands or go on walks. The wrist temperature sensor is mostly there to help with predicting cycles, so if you don’t ovulate it is unlikely to be useful to you right now. Sleep apnea notifications don’t affect non-sufferers, though they’re a nice feature to have. And finally, though I appreciate the ability to play songs of media through the watch’s onboard speaker, I rarely find myself wanting to do so. It might be worth noting that the SE 3 comes in one fewer color option than the SE 2. You can only choose between starlight (a warm light gray) or midnight (black), as the silver version is not available in the latest generation. Apple Watch Series 11 vs the Watch SE 3 The main thing I wanted to determine when reviewing the Watch SE 3 was whether it’s good enough to replace the Series 11. Like I said earlier, the short answer is yes, but it depends on how you use these devices. I don’t wear smartwatches to bed, and as a result my Watch SE 3 still has plenty of power left in the morning when I need it, so I’m a lot less affected by its relatively slower charging speeds. If you use your Apple Watch all the time, you might find something that recharges faster a lot more suitable — the Series 10 or 11 are both better on that front. The Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3 side by side on the same forearm, with the same photo watch face on their screens. Cherlynn Low for Engadget The Series 11’s larger screen and smaller bezels makes it a lot nicer to look at, though since the SE 3 also runs watchOS 26, I was able to use the same watch faces for both. Aesthetically, I didn’t find the two to be very far apart in terms of appearances, and if you’re not familiar with the latest Apple Watches like I am, you might not find the bezels as unsightly as I did. And though the SE 3 uses a flat OLED compared to the Series 11’s wide-angle OLED, I never really had an issue reading it, regardless of the position. Thanks to their electrical heart rate sensors, the Series 11 and Series 10 support Apple’s newer health-centric features like hypertension alerts, as well as apps for ECG and blood oxygen readings. The SE 3’s optical sensor is older and doesn’t have those capabilities, but you’ll still get notifications for irregular rhythms, low cardio fitness, as well as high and low heart rate notifications. Those were more than enough for me, and though I occasionally run an ECG reading on my Series 11, it’s not something I’d miss (especially if a $150 difference in price were in the balance). I’m also not a big swimmer or underwater enthusiast, so the SE 3’s lack of a depth gauge and water temperature sensor don’t bother me. All three watches I’ve mentioned in this section are water resistant to 50 meters, and that’s more than enough for my needs. If you want your watch to help with your underwater activities, it’s probably worth splurging on the Series 10 or 11. The pricier watches are also certified IP6x for dust resistance, meaning they should offer a bit more peace of mind for those who work on beaches or on job sites, for example. I’ve not yet encountered a smartwatch that stopped working due to dust ingress, regardless of whether it was rated, so the SE 3 not having this certification doesn’t bother me either. One thing that the most discerning tech fans might call out is the fact that the SE 3 doesn’t have the same ultra wideband (UWB) chip that the Series 10 and 11 do. This enables the greater precision in Find My that allows you to locate your iPhone or wearable down to the number of feet. But you’ll still get basic Find My support on the Watch SE 3, and honestly all I really did with this was to use my watch to ring my phone so I could confirm it was with me without having to dig through all the pockets in my gigantic purse. Still, if you use this Find My interface a lot, it’s worth considering when getting your next Apple Watch. Finally, if you’re a fan of the titanium finish or multiple color options in Apple’s more-premium lineup, only the Series 10 and 11 come in the silver and rose gold colors for the aluminum case. The Series 11 is also available in Space Gray in aluminum, as well as Slate, Gold and Natural hues for the titanium finish. Again, the SE 3 is only available in two colors. Using the Apple Watch SE 3 as a Series 11 wearer I’m the sort of person who straps on my smartwatch when I head out and removes it when I get home. When I’m outside, I expect my Apple Watch to track my steps and activity, automatically detect and log extended walks, tell me when someone’s calling or texting and keep tabs on my workouts. For all those situations, the SE 3 was more than adequate. Occasionally I noticed it was a bit slower than the Series 11 at recognizing when I was done working out and suggesting I end the session, but not at a frequency that was concerning. The SE 3 was also as capable as the Series 11 when it came to acting as a remote viewfinder for my iPhone’s camera, and Siri was satisfyingly responsive at launching my workouts or telling me about the weather. I also enjoyed having the double tap and wrist flick gestures at my disposal, and honestly kind of liked the watch’s smaller size. But I did miss the Series 11’s brighter screen and smaller bezels. I also prefer the Series 11 for its ability to recharge more quickly, as well as its slightly longer-lasting battery. Both still were able to make it through an entire day before needing a charge, but the Series 11 generally did more in the background in that amount of time. In the end, it wasn’t the features like blood oxygen readings or hypertension notifications that I wanted back. It boiled down to physical components like a brighter display or bigger battery and more durable case that I wanted around for peace of mind. Wrap-up Is peace of mind worth a $150 premium? In this economy, it’s hard to say. On one hand, it’s possible a $399 Apple Watch will outlast the $249 SE 3, mostly due to its harder materials, making it a more astute investment in the long run. But for those who currently have tight budgets and need to replace aging or broken smartwatches, the SE 3 is the way to go.

          "title": "Black Friday deal: The Google TV Streamer 4K drops to a record-low price",
          "standfirst": "One of the best streaming devices you can get today is deeply discounted on Amazon ahead of Black Friday. The Google TV Streamer is going for just $75 right now — the lowest price we've seen it hit yet. The device normally costs $100. The Amazon deal applies to both color options, White and the soft gray Haze. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste.

          "title": "Celosphere 2025: Where enterprise AI moved from experiment to execution",
          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisAfter a year of boardroom declarations about “AI transformation,” this was the week where enterprise leaders came together to talk about what actually works. Speaking from the stage at Celosphere in Munich, Celonis co-founder and co-CEO Alexander Rinke set the tone early in his keynote:“Only 11 % of companies are seeing measurable benefits from AI projects today,” he said. “That’s not an adoption problem. That’s a context problem.”It’s a sentiment familiar to anyone who’s tried to deploy AI inside a large enterprise. You can’t automate what you don’t understand — and most organizations still lack a unified picture of how work in their companies really gets done.Celonis’ answer, showcased across three days at the company’s annual event, was less about new tech acronyms and more about connective tissue: how to make AI fit within the messy, living processes that drive business. The company framed it as achieving a real “Return on AI (ROAI)” — measurable impact that comes only when intelligence is grounded in process context.A living model of how the enterprise worksAt the heart of the keynote was what Rinke called a “living digital twin of your operations.” Celonis has been building toward this moment for years — but this was the first time the company made clear how far that concept has evolved.“We start by freeing the process,” said Rinke. “Freeing it from the restrictions of your current legacy systems.” Data Core, Celonis’ data infrastructure, extracts raw data from source systems. It’s capable of querying billions of records in near real time with sub-minute refresh — extending visibility beyond traditional systems of record.Built on this foundation, the Process Intelligence Graph sits at the center of the Celonis Platform. It’s a system-agnostic, graph-based model that unifies data across systems, apps, and even devices, including task-mining data that captures clicks, spreadsheets, and browser activity. It combines this data with business context—business rules, KPIs, benchmarks, and exceptions. Every transaction, rule, and process interaction becomes part of a continuously updated replica that reflects how the organization actually operates.On top of the Graph, the company’s new Build Experience allows organizations to analyze, design, and operate AI-driven, composable processes — integrating AI where it delivers business impact, not just technical demos:Analyze where processes stall or repeatDesign the future state, setting outcomes, guardrails, and AI touchpointsOperate with humans, systems, and AI agents working in sync — now orchestrated through a generally available Orchestration Engine that can trigger and monitor every step in one flowIt’s a deliberate shift from discovery-driven AI pilots to outcome-driven AI operations — and a blueprint for orchestrating agentic AI, where human teams, systems, and autonomous agents work together through shared process context rather than in silos.Real-world proof: Mercedes-Benz, Vinmar, and UniperThe Celosphere stage offered real proof of theCelonisPlatform in action, through live stories from customers already building on it.Mercedes-Benz shared how process intelligence became their “connective tissue” during the semiconductor crisis. “We had data everywhere — plants, suppliers, logistics,” recalled Dr. Jörg Burzer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG. “What we didn’t have was a way to see it together. Celonis helped us connect those dots fast enough to act.”The partnership has since expanded across eight of the company’s ten most critical processes, from supply chain to quality to after-sales. But what impressed the audience wasn’t just the scale — it was the cultural shift.“If you show data in context, and let teams visualize processes, you also change the culture,” Burzer said. “It’s not just process transformation — it’s people transformation.”At Vinmar, CEO Vishal Baid described Celonis as “the foundation of our automation and AI strategy.” His global plastics distribution business has already automated its entire order-to-cash process for a $3 B unit, achieving a 40 % productivity lift. But Baid wasn’t there to just celebrate finished work — he was looking ahead. “Now we’re tackling the non-algorithmic stuff,” he said. “Matching purchase and sales orders sounds simple until you have thousands of edge cases. We’re building an AI agent that can do that allocation intelligently. That’s the next frontier.”And in the energy sector, Uniper, with partner Microsoft, demonstrated how process-aware AI copilots are already reshaping operations. Using Celonis and Microsoft’s AI stack, Uniper can predict when hydropower plants will need maintenance — and cluster those jobs to reduce downtime and emissions.“Each technician, each part, each system plays a role in a living process,” said Hans Berg, Uniper’s CIO. “The human can’t see all of it. But process intelligence can — and it can nudge the system toward the best outcome.”Agnes Heftberger, CVP & CEO, Microsoft Germany & Austria, who joined Berg on stage, summed it up crisply:“The hard part isn’t building AI features — it’s scaling them responsibly,” she explained. “You need to marry intelligence with the beating heart of the company: its processes.”Across the global community, Celonis reports more than $8 billion in realized business valueand over 120 certified value champions — proof that process intelligence is driving measurable impact far beyond pilots. Rinke called it “the early proof points of a true return on AI.” From closed systems to composable intelligenceCelosphere 2025 marked a shift from architecture to interoperability — from defining enterprise AI to making it work across boundaries.Rinke’s vision for the future is unapologetically open: “Good things grow from open ecosystems,” he said. That philosophy is taking shape through deeper platform integrations — including Microsoft Fabric, Databricks, and Bloomfilter — with zero-copy, bidirectional lakehouse access that lets customers query process data in place with minimal latency. The company also announced MCP Server support for embedding the Process Intelligence Graph directly into agentic AI platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Microsoft Copilot Studio.These updates make “composable enterprise AI” tangible — organizations can now assemble and govern AI solutions across ecosystems rather than being locked into any single vendor.Rather than competing on who has the “best agent,” the message was that enterprise AI will thrive when agents work together through shared context and models that mirror how businesses actually run.“Every vendor is bringing out their own agent,” Rinke said. “But each one is limited to that vendor’s world. If they can’t work together, they can’t work for you. That’s what process intelligence fixes.”The idea drew sustained applause. For companies juggling multiple cloud platforms, ERPs, and data tools, composability isn’t just elegant; it’s survival.Beyond operations: data, democracy, and directionThe closing moments of the keynote took an unexpected turn — from enterprise architecture to human courage. Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado joined live via satellite to share how her movement used data, encrypted apps, and civic coordination to expose election fraud and mobilize millions.It was a powerful contrast: the same principles — transparency, accountability, context — at work in both business and democracy.“Technology can be a weapon or a liberator,” Machado said. “It depends on who holds the context.”Her words landed with weight in a room full of people used to talking about data, systems, and governance — a reminder that context isn’t just technical, it’s human.Why this year matteredCelosphere 2025 marked a shift in how enterprises approach AI — from experimentation to results grounded in process intelligence. The shift was evident in both tone and technology, with a more powerful Data Core, enhanced Process Intelligence Graph, and new Build Experience. But the deeper takeaway was philosophical: AI only scales when it’s grounded in how people and systems actually work together.Celonis president Carsten Thoma was candid in acknowledging that early process-mining projects often “stormed in with discovery” before understanding organizational value — a lesson that now defines the company’s measured, pragmatic approach to enterprise AI.Rinke put it best near the end of his keynote:“We’re not just automating steps,” he said. “We’re building enterprises that can adapt instantly, innovate freely, and improve continuously.”Missed it?

The bill would complement the Trump administration overhaul of the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. The administration required states to rewrite their grant plans, reducing the overall projected spending and diverting some of the money from fiber projects to satellite. The result is that over $21 billion is projected to be left over after money is allocated to projects that expand broadband access. Current US law allows nondeployment funds to be used for other broadband-related purposes, like providing Wi-Fi and Internet-capable devices to US residents. But a draft bill by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) would change the law to redirect all the remaining money to the US Treasury for deficit reduction.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Amid what one judge called an “epidemic” of fake AI-generated case citations bogging down courts, some common excuses are emerging from lawyers hoping to dodge the most severe sanctions for filings deemed misleading. Using a database compiled by French lawyer and AI researcher Damien Charlotin, Ars reviewed 23 cases where lawyers were sanctioned for AI hallucinations. In many, judges noted that the simplest path to avoid or diminish sanctions was to admit that AI was used as soon as it’s detected, act humble, self-report the error to relevant legal associations, and voluntarily take classes on AI and law. But not every lawyer takes the path of least resistance, Ars’ review found, with many instead offering excuses that no judge found credible. Some even lie about their AI use, judges concluded. Since 2023—when fake AI citations started being publicized—the most popular excuse has been that the lawyer didn’t know AI was used to draft a filing.Read full article Comments",

The increasingly common method, which many potential targets have yet to learn of, is quick, bypasses most endpoint protections, and works against both macOS and Windows users. ClickFix often starts with an email sent from a hotel that the target has a pending registration with and references the correct registration information. In other cases, ClickFix attacks begin with a WhatsApp message. In still other cases, the user receives the URL at the top of Google results for a search query. Once the mark accesses the malicious site referenced, it presents a CAPTCHA challenge or other pretext requiring user confirmation. The user receives an instruction to copy a string of text, open a terminal window, paste it in, and press Enter. One line is all it takes Once entered, the string of text causes the PC or Mac to surreptitiously visit a scammer-controlled server and download malware. Then, the machine automatically installs it—all with no indication to the target. With that, users are infected, usually with credential-stealing malware. Security firms say ClickFix campaigns have run rampant. The lack of awareness of the technique, combined with the links also coming from known addresses or in search results, and the ability to bypass some endpoint protections are all factors driving the growth.Read full article Comments",

When we first learned of the smart tire, it was making its debut fitted to McLaren’s then-new plug-in hybrid supercar. As an alternative to a tire pressure monitoring system fitted to the car’s wheels, the Cyber Tire wirelessly reports its temperature and pressure to its car via Bluetooth Low Energy, along with some specific information about the tire itself. Since then, Pirelli has continued to develop the technology. When it created Cyber Tires for the Pagani Utopia, it allowed a car to tailor its antilock braking and electronic stability control to the specific rubber fitted to the wheels. Right now, a car’s ABS or ESC will be tuned regardless of the tires it’s fitted to. But a high-performance summer tire acts quite differently from a winter tire, not just because of the composition of the rubber but also due to the tread pattern, depth, and stiffness, not to mention factors like sidewall stiffness. And the Utopia can take advantage of that fact.Read full article Comments",

New research from AI startup Goodfire.ai provides the first potentially clear evidence that these different functions actually work through completely separate neural pathways in the model’s architecture. The researchers discovered that this separation proves remarkably clean. In a preprint paper released in late October, they described that when they removed the memorization pathways, models lost 97 percent of their ability to recite training data verbatim but kept nearly all their “logical reasoning” ability intact. For example, at layer 22 in Allen Institute for AI’s OLMo-7B language model, the researchers ranked all the weight components (the mathematical values that process information) from high to low based on a measure called “curvature” (which we’ll explain more below). When they examined these ranked components, the bottom 50 percent of weight components showed 23 percent higher activation on memorized data, while the top 10 percent showed 26 percent higher activation on general, non-memorized text.Read full article Comments",

The fact that Canada has lost its elimination status means that the region of the Americas overall has also lost the status, which it achieved in 2016. Of the 35 countries and territories in the region—a health region designated by the World Health Organization—Canada is currently the only country where measles is considered to be spreading endemically, though other countries, namely the US and Mexico, are headed in the same direction. Measles is considered eliminated when a country can go 12 months without continuous local spread.

In September, we got The Long Walk, an excellent (though harrowing) adaptation of King’s 1979 Richard Bachman novel. Last month, HBO debuted its new series IT: Welcome to Derry, which explores the mythology and origins of Pennywise the killer clown. And this Friday is the premiere of The Running Man, director Edgar Wright’s (Shaun of the Dead, Baby Driver, Last Night in Soho) take on King’s novel of the same name. So naturally Paramount has released a final trailer to lure us to the theater. As previously reported, the 1987 action film starring Schwarzenegger was only loosely based on King’s novel, preserving the basic concept and very little else in favor of more sci-fi gadgetry and high-octane action. It was a noisy, entertaining romp—and very late ’80s—but it lacked King’s subtler satirical tone. Wright expressed interest in adapting his own version of The Running Man in 2017, and Paramount greenlit the project four years later. Wright and co-screenwriter Michael Bacall envisioned their film as less of a remake and more of a faithful adaptation of King’s original novel.

          "content": "After a weekend off, perhaps spent trick or treating, Formula 1’s drivers, engineers, and mechanics made their yearly trip to the Interlagos track for the Brazilian Grand Prix. More formally called the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace, it’s definitely one of the more old-school circuits that F1 visits—and invariably one of the more dramatic. For one thing, it’s anything but billiard-smooth. Better yet, there’s elevation—lots of it—and cambers, too. Unlike most F1 tracks, it runs counterclockwise, and it combines some very fast sections with several rather technical corners that can catch out even the best drivers in the world. Nestled between a couple of lakes in São Paulo, weather is also a regular factor in races here. And indeed, a severe weather warning was issued in the lead-up to this weekend’s race. You have to hit the ground running This was another sprint weekend, which means that instead of two practice sessions on Friday and another on Saturday morning, the teams get one on Friday, then go into qualifying for the Saturday sprint race. The shortened testing time tends to shake things up a bit, and we definitely saw that this weekend.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "After a long summer and fall of uncertainty, private astronaut Jared Isaacman has been renominated to lead NASA, and there appears to be momentum behind getting him confirmed quickly as the space agency’s 15th administrator. It is possible, although far from a lock, the Senate could finalize his nomination before the end of this year. It cannot happen soon enough. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is, to put it bluntly, kind of a mess. This is not meant to disparage the many fine people who work at NASA. But years of neglect, changing priorities, mismanagement, creeping bureaucracy, meeting bloat, and other factors have taken their toll. NASA is still capable of doing great things. It still inspires. But it needs a fresh start.Read full article Comments",
