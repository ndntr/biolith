          "title": "The best gaming headsets for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Sometimes, the best gaming headset doesn’t have to be a “gaming headset” at all. While many people view these devices as their own category, they’re ultimately still headphones, just with a boom mic and some fancy branding attached. While the overall quality of dedicated headsets has improved over time, they still tend to cost extra compared to a good pair of wired headphones (which, yes, still exist). If you need to chat with friends, you can always buy a microphone separately and get superior sound quality there as well.That said, we completely understand that many people just want the simplicity of a headset with a built-in mic. So after testing dozens of contenders over the past couple of years, we’ve rounded up a few commendable gaming headsets and headphones that work well for gaming — which aren’t quite the same thing. Whichever way you go, all of our picks should make your game time more enjoyable, whether you play competitively or just for fun. Table of contents Best gaming headphones for 2025 Best gaming headsets for 2025 Other gaming headsets we've tested Best gaming headsets and headphones: What to look for Recent updates Best gaming headphones for 2025 Best gaming headsets for 2025 Other gaming headsets we've tested The PlayStation Pulse Elite. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming headsets and headphones we’ve put through their paces, not a comprehensive list of everything we’ve ever tried. PlayStation Pulse Elite The PlayStation Pulse Elite is a reasonable alternative to the Turtle Beach Atlas Air for PS5 owners, as it allows you to change volume, swap between different EQ presets, adjust the game-to-chat mix and mute the mic right from the console’s native UI. It’s similar to the way AirPods integrate with iPhones. This pair also lets you connect to a second device over Bluetooth at the same time, and the planar magnetic drivers — a rarity for $150 headphones — do a decent job of reproducing smaller details. The sound profile as a whole is narrower and more uneven in the bass and treble than the Atlas Air, however, while the all-plastic design is comfortable but flimsy-feeling. It also doesn’t do much to block outside noise, despite being closed-back, and the control buttons are awkward to reach. PlayStation Pulse Expore We also tested the in-ear equivalent to the Pulse Elite, the PlayStation Pulse Explore, but found it too uncomfortable to wear over extended sessions. This one is limited to roughly five hours of battery life, too. Astro A50 (Gen 5) The Astro A50 (Gen 5) is effectively the same headset as the A50X, just without any HDMI ports on its base station. It costs $100 less, so it’s a worthy alternative to the Audeze Maxwell if you mainly play on one platform and want a superior microphone. But the ability to automatically switch between consoles is the thing that makes the A50X worth buying in the first place, so that convenience is still worth paying for if you game on multiple devices. The Corsair Virtuoso Pro. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Corsair Virtuoso Pro The Corsair Virtuoso Pro is another one of the few dedicated gaming headsets with an open-back design. It has a relatively dark sound with mostly underemphasized treble and elevated upper-bass, though the highs are clearer here than they are on the Astro A40 — a former top pick that's now discontinued — and it still delivers a wider soundstage than most gaming headsets. We preferred this signature over Astro’s pair with some games, though in others it felt less balanced. The Virtuoso Pro’s mic still sounds fairly thin as well, so it’s merely decent compared to the wider headset market. Its headband adjustment mechanism feels cheap, too, and you can’t detach the mic without swapping cables out entirely. Its round, breathable ear cups and manageable weight do make it easy to wear, though, and it comes with a sturdy travel case for protection. Ultimately, it’s a decent buy, but it’s hard to justify over the more featured and easier-sounding Atlas Air. HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless can last well over 300 hours at moderate volumes, which is remarkable and by far the best of any wireless model we’ve tested. It’s light and not too snug on the head, and its powerful bass lends a real sense of excitement to in-game action. But it blunts more detail than the Atlas Air, Maxwell and A50 X, and its mic isn’t as good. Several users have also reported latency issues when using the headset with HyperX’s Ngenuity software, and there’s no Xbox, Bluetooth or wired audio support. Still, if battery life is paramount, you may be able to look past all of that. The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed If the Audeze Maxwell is out of stock, the Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed is another quality wireless headset worth considering. It sounds better than something like the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless, with satisfying but more controlled bass and more accurate mids. It’s also lighter on the head than the Maxwell. Logitech rates its battery life at 50 hours, but we found it to last much longer at moderate volumes. However, similar to the Astro A50 X, a dip in the treble makes it sound darker and more veiled than the Maxwell, and it doesn’t have any HDMI-switching tricks to fall back on. Its mic also sounds less natural than those of the Maxwell and A50 X. Plus, while it can connect over a USB dongle, Bluetooth or a 3.5mm cable, it can’t pair to two devices at once like Audeze’s and Astro’s pairs. Our biggest issue is the price: Value-wise, it’s in something of a no man’s land at its MSRP of $280. It’s a fine choice if it ever dips around $200, though. Razer BlackShark V2 Pro The wireless Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is tremendously comfortable and has a good mic, but its boomy sound is less refined and detailed than the Audeze Maxwell. As a closed-back headset, it also lacks the width of the Atlas Air. There’s no support for wired audio either. It's worth noting that Razer has released a new BlackShark V3 Pro model that adds active noise cancellation, wired audio support and the ability to listen to multiple audio sources simultaneously, among other tweaks. We haven't tested it yet, but it also costs $50 more at $250. Logitech G535 Lightspeed The Logitech G535 is an impressively light (0.52 pounds) and comfy wireless headset that’s often available for $100 or less. It has a relatively neutral sound signature: not flat, but not beholden to big, thumping bass. It can make details in the mids sound thin, and if anything it could use a little more sub-bass, but it’s an agreeable listen overall. However, its mic isn't especially full, and its 35-or-so-hour battery life is a significant drop from our top recommendations. It doesn’t work with Xbox’s wireless protocol or Bluetooth either, and it forces you to crank the volume to reach a listenable level. But if you don’t want to spend a ton on a wireless headset, it’s a fine value. The Logitech G535 Lightspeed. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Xbox owners who want a more affordable wireless headset than the Audeze Maxwell could do worse than the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X. It’s another bass-forward pair, and its mic is comparable to that of the Cloud Alpha Wireless. It offers multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth and a 3.5mm cable. While it's marketed for Xbox, it can also connect to PCs and PS5s. Its 30-ish-hour battery life is well short of the Maxwell and Cloud Alpha Wireless, however, and its uneven treble can cause things like in-game dialogue to sound masked in certain titles. SteelSeries sells a cheaper Arctis Nova 5X model with longer battery life, though we haven't been able to test that one yet, and it doesn't support wired connections. HyperX Cloud Alpha The wired HyperX Cloud Alpha often goes for $80 or less, and at that price it’s fine as a mild step-up from the Cloud Stinger 2 if you really want a closed-back gaming headset. It’s old, but its plush earpads and headband are comfy, and its detachable mic, while not superb, is still serviceable. Its treble is underemphasized, however, and again it sounds more “in your head” than our open-back picks. SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro is a comfortable wired-only headset with a good mic and a useful DAC that makes it easy to adjust the headset’s EQ and game-to-chat mix on the fly. However, its closed-back design can’t provide the same enveloping sense of width, and its default sound can sound piercing in the treble. It’s also pricier, typically fluctuating between $200 to $280 these days. SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is largely similar to its wired counterpart but adds a passable level of active noise cancellation. Being able to hot-swap battery packs and connect to multiple devices at once is also nice. It’s not as convenient for multi-console play as the Astro A50 X, though, and it's usually not much cheaper than the Audeze Maxwell, which sounds better, has a superior mic and lasts longer on a charge. The Beyerdynamic MMX 200 (left) and HyperX Cloud III Wireless (right). Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro There’s nothing particularly bad about the Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro: It uses the same drivers as the DT 900 Pro X, its velour earpads are comfy and its mic works well. It’s just hard to recommend spending $380 on a wired-only headset when the Audeze Maxwell offers wireless functionality and similarly excellent sound — with slightly less spiky treble and more even bass — for $80 less. The MMX 300 Pro’s mic isn’t detachable either, and the closed-back design keeps it from sounding as wide as the DT 900 Pro X. HyperX Cloud III Wireless The HyperX Cloud III Wireless is comfy and can last up to 120 hours per charge, but it sounds less dynamic than the older Cloud Alpha Wireless, with weaker bass response. Like that pair, it also lacks a 3.5mm jack, Bluetooth audio support and Xbox compatibility. The Cloud Alpha Wireless still gets nearly three times the battery life, too, so it remains a better buy if you want a wireless headset for PS5 or PC gaming in the $150 range. The Cloud III Wireless has also become harder to find in stock in recent months. Sennheiser HD 490 Pro The Sennheiser HD 490 Pro are studio-focused open-back headphones that also work well for gaming. They come with two sets of ear pads, one that slightly elevates the bass and another that bumps the midrange, though they deliver impressive width and detail either way without pushing too hard in one direction. They’re also a pleasure to wear over long periods, both lighter than the DT 900 Pro X and less stiff than the HD 560S. That said, they're often priced around $400, and their sound profile is more of a nice alternative to our top picks than something clearly more natural or resolving. Most people don’t need to pay the premium. Best gaming headsets and headphones: What to look for The HyperX Cloud Stinger 2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Evaluating headphones is a particularly subjective exercise, so calling one pair the absolute “best” is something of a fool’s errand. At a certain point, whether you're an audiophile or not, everything becomes a matter of taste. For most, a headphone with a wide soundscape and strong imaging performance — i.e., the ability to position sounds correctly, so you can more precisely tell where footsteps and other gameplay effects are coming from — will provide the most immersive gaming experience, the kind that makes you feel like your head is within a given scene. For that, you want a high-quality pair of open-back headphones. That is to say, an over-ear pair whose ear cups do not completely seal off the ear from air and outside noise. These are inherently terrible at isolating you from external sound and preventing others from hearing what you’re playing, so if you often play games in a noisy environment, their benefits will be blunted. But in a quiet room, the best open-back pairs sound significantly wider and more precise than more common closed-back models. More up for debate is how a good gaming headphone should sound. If you want something that’ll help you in competitive multiplayer games, you may prefer a headphone with a flatter sound signature, which'll keep a game’s mix from being overly boosted in one direction and is less likely to mask the smaller details of what’s happening around you. A slightly brighter sound, one that pushes the upper frequencies a tad, may also work. Open-back headphones almost never have huge sub-bass, so you rarely have to worry about low-end sounds muddying up the rest of the signature. In this light, the fact that an overwhelming amount of gaming headsets are closed-back and bass-heavy seems counterintuitive. Lots of people love bass, though. And if you don't really care about competitive play, some extra low-end can add a touch of excitement to action scenes or rousing soundtracks. You still don’t want a pair that boosts the low-end too hard — as many gaming headsets do — but the point is that what makes a pair “immersive” to one person may sound dull to another. Recent updates November 2025: We’ve updated this guide for clarity and made sure all pricing and availability details are accurate. We’ve also removed the Astro A40 TR, our longtime favorite wired headset, as it appears to have been discontinued (and since our top wireless pick comes with a cable in the box anyway). April 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and removed our testing notes for the Beyerdynamic MMX 200, which is no longer available. January 2025: We’ve looked over this guide to ensure our picks are still accurate and added notes on a few more headsets we’ve recently tested, including the PlayStation Pulse Elite, Astro A50 (Gen 5) and Beyerdynamic MMX 300 Pro. November 2024: We've updated this guide with a new recommendation for the best dedicated gaming headset, the Turtle Beach Atlas Air, and reorganized our picks accordingly. We've also added notes on other gaming-friendly headphones we've tested, including the Sennheiser HD 490 Pro and Razer BlackShark V2 Pro, and removed a couple of write-ups on headsets that are no longer available.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html?src=rss",

These are inherently terrible at isolating you from external sound and preventing others from hearing what you’re playing, so if you often play games in a noisy environment, their benefits will be blunted. But in a quiet room, the best open-back pairs sound significantly wider and more precise than more common closed-back models. More up for debate is how a good gaming headphone should sound. If you want something that’ll help you in competitive multiplayer games, you may prefer a headphone with a flatter sound signature, which'll keep a game’s mix from being overly boosted in one direction and is less likely to mask the smaller details of what’s happening around you. A slightly brighter sound, one that pushes the upper frequencies a tad, may also work. Open-back headphones almost never have huge sub-bass, so you rarely have to worry about low-end sounds muddying up the rest of the signature. In this light, the fact that an overwhelming amount of gaming headsets are closed-back and bass-heavy seems counterintuitive. Lots of people love bass, though. And if you don't really care about competitive play, some extra low-end can add a touch of excitement to action scenes or rousing soundtracks. You still don’t want a pair that boosts the low-end too hard — as many gaming headsets do — but the point is that what makes a pair “immersive” to one person may sound dull to another. Recent updates November 2025: We’ve updated this guide for clarity and made sure all pricing and availability details are accurate.

          "standfirst": "If you hate losing stuff — your keys, backpack, jacket, purse or just about anything else — a Bluetooth tracker can help. These little tags pair with your smartphone so you can make your keys chirp from the couch cushions or your jacket sing from the hall closet. Even better, these fobs tap into larger community networks, like Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, to locate tagged items you misplace out in the world. We tested Apple AirTags, Samsung’s own trackers and many third party fobs from Chipolo, Pebblebee and others that work with either the Apple or Android networks. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers that’ll make sure you don’t lose a thing. Table of contents The best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device How we tested Bluetooth trackers Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Bluetooth tracker FAQs Best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. Device compatibility Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags. Finding network Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range. Apple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US Now that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices. Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users. In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Samsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs. Amy Skorheim / Engadget Separation alerts A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house. Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item. Connectivity and volume The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device. If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature. The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels. Design and alternative formats Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring. You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The SmartLock from KeySmart is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag. Battery life AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable). Stalking, theft and data privacy AirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android. Last year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose. How we tested Bluetooth trackers Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options. Here’s the full list of every tracker we tested: Apple AirTag Chipolo Card Spot Chipolo One Spot Chipolo One Chipolo Card Chipolo Loop Chipolo Pop KeySmart SmartLock Motorola Moto Tag Pebblebe Clip Universal Pebblebee Clip Samsung SmartTag 2 Chipolo One Point Pebblebee Clip for Android Tile Pro (2024) Tile Mate (2024) Tile Mate (2022) Tile Pro (2022) Tile Slim (2022) After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use. As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. The HyperShield Universal Locator from Hyper works with both Apple’s FindMy or Google’s Find Hub. It’s cheaper than most trackers at $20, but has a shorter, 50-foot range. We’re in the process of testing it and will add what we find to this guide. Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Motorola Moto Tag The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house. It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself just out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better. Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024) Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices. There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob. I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).

So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US Now that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices. Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users. In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Samsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs. Amy Skorheim / Engadget Separation alerts A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house. Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item. Connectivity and volume The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device. If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature. The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels. Design and alternative formats Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring. You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The SmartLock from KeySmart is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag. Battery life AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable). Stalking, theft and data privacy AirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android. Last year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose. How we tested Bluetooth trackers Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options. Here’s the full list of every tracker we tested: Apple AirTag Chipolo Card Spot Chipolo One Spot Chipolo One Chipolo Card Chipolo Loop Chipolo Pop KeySmart SmartLock Motorola Moto Tag Pebblebe Clip Universal Pebblebee Clip Samsung SmartTag 2 Chipolo One Point Pebblebee Clip for Android Tile Pro (2024) Tile Mate (2024) Tile Mate (2022) Tile Pro (2022) Tile Slim (2022) After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use. As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. The HyperShield Universal Locator from Hyper works with both Apple’s FindMy or Google’s Find Hub. It’s cheaper than most trackers at $20, but has a shorter, 50-foot range. We’re in the process of testing it and will add what we find to this guide. Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Motorola Moto Tag The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house. It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself just out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better. Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024) Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices. There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob. I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).

          "title": "Grok 4.1 Fast's compelling dev access and Agent Tools API overshadowed by Musk glazing",
          "standfirst": "Elon Musk&#x27;s frontier generative AI startup xAI formally opened developer access to its Grok 4.1 Fast models last night and introduced a new Agent Tools API—but the technical milestones were immediately subverted by a wave of public ridicule about Grok&#x27;s responses on the social network X over the last few days praising its creator Musk as more athletic than championship-winning American football players and legendary boxer Mike Tyson, despite having displayed no public prowess at either sport.They emerge as yet another black eye for xAI&#x27;s Grok following the \"MechaHitler\" scandal in the summer of 2025, in which an earlier version of Grok adopted a verbally antisemitic persona inspired by the late German dictator and Holocaust architect, and an incident in May 2025 which it replied to X users to discuss unfounded claims of \"white genocide\" in Musk&#x27;s home country of South Africa to unrelated subject matter.This time, X users shared dozens of examples of Grok alleging Musk was stronger or more performant than elite athletes and a greater thinker than luminaries such as Albert Einstein, sparking questions about the AI&#x27;s reliability, bias controls, adversarial prompting defenses, and the credibility of xAI’s public claims about “maximally truth-seeking” models. .Against this backdrop, xAI’s actual developer-focused announcement—the first-ever API availability for Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, Grok 4.1 Fast Non-Reasoning, and the Agent Tools API—landed in a climate dominated by memes, skepticism, and renewed scrutiny.How the Grok Musk Glazing Controversy Overshadowed the API ReleaseAlthough Grok 4.1 was announced on the evening of Monday, November 17, 2025 as available to consumers via the X and Grok apps and websites, the API launch announced last night, on November 19, was intended to mark a developer-focused expansion. Instead, the conversation across X shifted sharply toward Grok’s behavior in consumer channels.Between November 17–20, users discovered that Grok would frequently deliver exaggerated, implausible praise for Musk when prompted—sometimes subtly, often brazenly. Responses declaring Musk “more fit than LeBron James,” a superior quarterback to Peyton Manning, or “smarter than Albert Einstein” gained massive engagement. When paired with identical prompts substituting “Bill Gates” or other figures, Grok often responded far more critically, suggesting inconsistent preference handling or latent alignment drift.Screenshots spread by high-engagement accounts (e.g., @SilvermanJacob, @StatisticUrban) framed Grok as unreliable or compromised.Memetic commentary—“Elon’s only friend is Grok”—became shorthand for perceived sycophancy.Media coverage, including a November 20 report from The Verge, characterized Grok’s responses as “weird worship,” highlighting claims that Musk is “as smart as da Vinci” and “fitter than LeBron James.”Critical threads argued that Grok’s design choices replicated past alignment failures, such as a July 2025 incident where Grok generated problematic praise of Adolf Hitler under certain prompting conditions.The viral nature of the glazing overshadowed the technical release and complicated xAI’s messaging about accuracy and trustworthiness.Implications for Developer Adoption and TrustThe juxtaposition of a major API release with a public credibility crisis raises several concerns:Alignment Controls The glazing behavior suggests that prompt adversariality may expose latent preference biases, undermining claims of “truth-maximization.”Brand Contamination Across Deployment Contexts Though the consumer chatbot and API-accessible model share lineage, developers may conflate the reliability of both—even if safeguards differ.Risk in Agentic Systems The Agent Tools API gives Grok abilities such as web search, code execution, and document retrieval. Bias-driven misjudgments in those contexts could have material consequences.Regulatory Scrutiny Biased outputs that systematically favor a CEO or public figure could attract attention from consumer protection regulators evaluating AI representational neutrality.Developer Hesitancy Early adopters may wait for evidence that the model version exposed through the API is not subject to the same glazing behaviors seen in consumer channels.Musk himself attempted to defuse the situation with a self-deprecating X post this evening, writing:“Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me. For the record, I am a fat retard.”While intended to signal transparency, the admission did not directly address whether the root cause was adversarial prompting alone or whether model training introduced unintentional positive priors. Nor did it clarify whether the API-exposed versions of Grok 4.1 Fast differ meaningfully from the consumer version that produced the offending outputs.Until xAI provides deeper technical detail about prompt vulnerabilities, preference modeling, and safety guardrails, the controversy is likely to persist.Two Grok 4.1 Models Available on xAI APIAlthough consumers using Grok apps gained access to Grok 4.1 Fast earlier in the week, developers could not previously use the model through the xAI API. The latest release closes that gap by adding two new models to the public model catalog:grok-4-1-fast-reasoning — designed for maximal reasoning performance and complex tool workflowsgrok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning — optimized for extremely fast responsesBoth models support a 2 million–token context window, aligning them with xAI’s long-context roadmap and providing substantial headroom for multistep agent tasks, document processing, and research workflows.The new additions appear alongside updated entries in xAI’s pricing and rate-limit tables, confirming that they now function as first-class API endpoints across xAI infrastructure and routing partners such as OpenRouter.Agent Tools API: A New Server-Side Tool LayerThe other major component of the announcement is the Agent Tools API, which introduces a unified mechanism for Grok to call tools across a range of capabilities:Search Tools including a direct link to X (Twitter) search for real-time conversations and web search for broad external retrieval.Files Search: Retrieval and citation of relevant documents uploaded by usersCode Execution: A secure Python sandbox for analysis, simulation, and data processingMCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration: Connects Grok agents with third-party tools or custom enterprise systemsxAI emphasizes that the API handles all infrastructure complexity—including sandboxing, key management, rate limiting, and environment orchestration—on the server side. Developers simply declare which tools are available, and Grok autonomously decides when and how to invoke them. The company highlights that the model frequently performs multi-tool, multi-turn workflows in parallel, reducing latency for complex tasks.How the New API Layer Leverages Grok 4.1 FastWhile the model existed before today’s API release, Grok 4.1 Fast was trained explicitly for tool-calling performance. The model’s long-horizon reinforcement learning tuning supports autonomous planning, which is essential for agent systems that chain multiple operations.Key behaviors highlighted by xAI include:Consistent output quality across the full 2M token context window, enabled by long-horizon RLReduced hallucination rate, cut in half compared with Grok 4 Fast while maintaining Grok 4’s factual accuracy performanceParallel tool use, where Grok executes multiple tool calls concurrently when solving multi-step problemsAdaptive reasoning, allowing the model to plan tool sequences over several turnsThis behavior aligns directly with the Agent Tools API’s purpose: to give Grok the external capabilities necessary for autonomous agent work.Benchmark Results Demonstrating Highest Agentic PerformancexAI released a set of benchmark results intended to illustrate how Grok 4.1 Fast performs when paired with the Agent Tools API, emphasizing scenarios that rely on tool calling, long-context reasoning, and multi-step task execution. On τ²-bench Telecom, a benchmark built to replicate real-world customer-support workflows involving tool use, Grok 4.1 Fast achieved the highest score among all listed models — outpacing even Google&#x27;s new Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s recent 5.1 on high reasoning — while also achieving among the lowest prices for developers and users. The evaluation, independently verified by Artificial Analysis, cost $105 to complete and served as one of xAI’s central claims of superiority in agentic performance.In structured function-calling tests, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning recorded a 72 percent overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling v4 benchmark, a result accompanied by a reported cost of $400 for the run. xAI noted that Gemini 3 Pro’s comparative result in this benchmark stemmed from independent estimates rather than an official submission, leaving some uncertainty in cross-model comparisons.Long-horizon evaluations further underscored the model’s design emphasis on stability across large contexts. In multi-turn tests involving extended dialog and expanded context windows, Grok 4.1 Fast outperformed both Grok 4 Fast and the earlier Grok 4, aligning with xAI’s claims that long-horizon reinforcement learning helped mitigate the typical degradation seen in models operating at the two-million-token scale.A second cluster of benchmarks—Research-Eval, FRAMES, and X Browse—highlighted Grok 4.1 Fast’s capabilities in tool-augmented research tasks. Across all three evaluations, Grok 4.1 Fast paired with the Agent Tools API earned the highest scores among the models with published results. It also delivered the lowest average cost per query in Research-Eval and FRAMES, reinforcing xAI’s messaging on cost-efficient research performance. In X Browse, an internal xAI benchmark assessing multihop search capabilities across the X platform, Grok 4.1 Fast again led its peers, though Gemini 3 Pro lacked cost data for direct comparison.Developer Pricing and Temporary Free AccessAPI pricing for Grok 4.1 Fast is as follows:Input tokens: $0.20 per 1MCached input tokens: $0.05 per 1MOutput tokens: $0.50 per 1MTool calls: From $5 per 1,000 successful tool invocationsTo facilitate early experimentation:Grok 4.1 Fast is free on OpenRouter until December 3rd.The Agent Tools API is also free through December 3rd via the xAI API.When paying for the models outside of the free period, Grok 4.1 Fast reasoning and non-reasoning are both among the cheaper options from major frontier labs through their own APIs.

Across multiple agentic and function-calling benchmarks, the model consistently outperforms or matches leading systems like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1 (high), and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, while operating inside a far more economical cost envelope. At $0.70 per million tokens, both Grok 4.1 Fast variants sit only marginally above ultracheap models like Qwen 3 Turbo but deliver accuracy levels in line with systems that cost 10–20× more per unit. The τ²-bench Telecom results reinforce this value proposition: Grok 4.1 Fast not only achieved the highest score in its test cohort but also appears to be the lowest-cost model in that benchmark run. In practical terms, this gives enterprises an unusually favorable cost-to-intelligence ratio, particularly for workloads involving multistep planning, tool use, and long-context reasoning.However, performance and pricing are only part of the equation for organizations considering large-scale adoption. The recent “glazing” controversy from Grok’s consumer deployment on X — combined with the earlier \"MechaHitler\" and \"White Genocid\" incidents — expose credibility and trust-surface risks that enterprises cannot ignore. Even if the API models are technically distinct from the consumer-facing variant, the inability to prevent sycophantic, adversarially-induced bias in a high-visibility environment raises legitimate concerns about downstream reliability in operational contexts. Enterprise procurement teams will rightly ask whether similar vulnerabilities—preference skew, alignment drift, or context-sensitive bias—could surface when Grok is connected to production databases, workflow engines, code-execution tools, or research pipelines.The introduction of the Agent Tools API raises the stakes further. Grok 4.1 Fast is not just a text generator—it is now an orchestrator of web searches, X-data queries, document retrieval operations, and remote Python execution. These agentic capabilities amplify productivity but also expand the blast radius of any misalignment. A model that can over-index on flattering a public figure could, in principle, also misprioritize results, mis-handle safety boundaries, or deliver skewed interpretations when operating with real-world data. Enterprises therefore need a clear understanding of how xAI isolates, audits, and hardens its API models relative to the consumer-facing Grok whose failures drove the latest scrutiny.The result is a mixed strategic picture. On performance and price, Grok 4.1 Fast is highly competitive—arguably one of the strongest value propositions in the modern LLM market. But xAI’s enterprise appeal will ultimately depend on whether the company can convincingly demonstrate that the alignment instability, susceptibility to adversarial prompting, and bias-amplifying behavior observed on X do not translate into its developer-facing platform. Without transparent safeguards, auditability, and reproducible evaluation across the very tools that enable autonomous operation, organizations may hesitate to commit core workloads to a system whose reliability is still the subject of public doubt.

          "content": "Elon Musk&#x27;s frontier generative AI startup xAI formally opened developer access to its Grok 4.1 Fast models last night and introduced a new Agent Tools API—but the technical milestones were immediately subverted by a wave of public ridicule about Grok&#x27;s responses on the social network X over the last few days praising its creator Musk as more athletic than championship-winning American football players and legendary boxer Mike Tyson, despite having displayed no public prowess at either sport.They emerge as yet another black eye for xAI&#x27;s Grok following the \"MechaHitler\" scandal in the summer of 2025, in which an earlier version of Grok adopted a verbally antisemitic persona inspired by the late German dictator and Holocaust architect, and an incident in May 2025 which it replied to X users to discuss unfounded claims of \"white genocide\" in Musk&#x27;s home country of South Africa to unrelated subject matter.This time, X users shared dozens of examples of Grok alleging Musk was stronger or more performant than elite athletes and a greater thinker than luminaries such as Albert Einstein, sparking questions about the AI&#x27;s reliability, bias controls, adversarial prompting defenses, and the credibility of xAI’s public claims about “maximally truth-seeking” models. .Against this backdrop, xAI’s actual developer-focused announcement—the first-ever API availability for Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, Grok 4.1 Fast Non-Reasoning, and the Agent Tools API—landed in a climate dominated by memes, skepticism, and renewed scrutiny.How the Grok Musk Glazing Controversy Overshadowed the API ReleaseAlthough Grok 4.1 was announced on the evening of Monday, November 17, 2025 as available to consumers via the X and Grok apps and websites, the API launch announced last night, on November 19, was intended to mark a developer-focused expansion. Instead, the conversation across X shifted sharply toward Grok’s behavior in consumer channels.Between November 17–20, users discovered that Grok would frequently deliver exaggerated, implausible praise for Musk when prompted—sometimes subtly, often brazenly. Responses declaring Musk “more fit than LeBron James,” a superior quarterback to Peyton Manning, or “smarter than Albert Einstein” gained massive engagement. When paired with identical prompts substituting “Bill Gates” or other figures, Grok often responded far more critically, suggesting inconsistent preference handling or latent alignment drift.Screenshots spread by high-engagement accounts (e.g., @SilvermanJacob, @StatisticUrban) framed Grok as unreliable or compromised.Memetic commentary—“Elon’s only friend is Grok”—became shorthand for perceived sycophancy.Media coverage, including a November 20 report from The Verge, characterized Grok’s responses as “weird worship,” highlighting claims that Musk is “as smart as da Vinci” and “fitter than LeBron James.”Critical threads argued that Grok’s design choices replicated past alignment failures, such as a July 2025 incident where Grok generated problematic praise of Adolf Hitler under certain prompting conditions.The viral nature of the glazing overshadowed the technical release and complicated xAI’s messaging about accuracy and trustworthiness.Implications for Developer Adoption and TrustThe juxtaposition of a major API release with a public credibility crisis raises several concerns:Alignment Controls The glazing behavior suggests that prompt adversariality may expose latent preference biases, undermining claims of “truth-maximization.”Brand Contamination Across Deployment Contexts Though the consumer chatbot and API-accessible model share lineage, developers may conflate the reliability of both—even if safeguards differ.Risk in Agentic Systems The Agent Tools API gives Grok abilities such as web search, code execution, and document retrieval. Bias-driven misjudgments in those contexts could have material consequences.Regulatory Scrutiny Biased outputs that systematically favor a CEO or public figure could attract attention from consumer protection regulators evaluating AI representational neutrality.Developer Hesitancy Early adopters may wait for evidence that the model version exposed through the API is not subject to the same glazing behaviors seen in consumer channels.Musk himself attempted to defuse the situation with a self-deprecating X post this evening, writing:“Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me. For the record, I am a fat retard.”While intended to signal transparency, the admission did not directly address whether the root cause was adversarial prompting alone or whether model training introduced unintentional positive priors. Nor did it clarify whether the API-exposed versions of Grok 4.1 Fast differ meaningfully from the consumer version that produced the offending outputs.Until xAI provides deeper technical detail about prompt vulnerabilities, preference modeling, and safety guardrails, the controversy is likely to persist.Two Grok 4.1 Models Available on xAI APIAlthough consumers using Grok apps gained access to Grok 4.1 Fast earlier in the week, developers could not previously use the model through the xAI API. The latest release closes that gap by adding two new models to the public model catalog:grok-4-1-fast-reasoning — designed for maximal reasoning performance and complex tool workflowsgrok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning — optimized for extremely fast responsesBoth models support a 2 million–token context window, aligning them with xAI’s long-context roadmap and providing substantial headroom for multistep agent tasks, document processing, and research workflows.The new additions appear alongside updated entries in xAI’s pricing and rate-limit tables, confirming that they now function as first-class API endpoints across xAI infrastructure and routing partners such as OpenRouter.Agent Tools API: A New Server-Side Tool LayerThe other major component of the announcement is the Agent Tools API, which introduces a unified mechanism for Grok to call tools across a range of capabilities:Search Tools including a direct link to X (Twitter) search for real-time conversations and web search for broad external retrieval.Files Search: Retrieval and citation of relevant documents uploaded by usersCode Execution: A secure Python sandbox for analysis, simulation, and data processingMCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration: Connects Grok agents with third-party tools or custom enterprise systemsxAI emphasizes that the API handles all infrastructure complexity—including sandboxing, key management, rate limiting, and environment orchestration—on the server side. Developers simply declare which tools are available, and Grok autonomously decides when and how to invoke them. The company highlights that the model frequently performs multi-tool, multi-turn workflows in parallel, reducing latency for complex tasks.How the New API Layer Leverages Grok 4.1 FastWhile the model existed before today’s API release, Grok 4.1 Fast was trained explicitly for tool-calling performance. The model’s long-horizon reinforcement learning tuning supports autonomous planning, which is essential for agent systems that chain multiple operations.Key behaviors highlighted by xAI include:Consistent output quality across the full 2M token context window, enabled by long-horizon RLReduced hallucination rate, cut in half compared with Grok 4 Fast while maintaining Grok 4’s factual accuracy performanceParallel tool use, where Grok executes multiple tool calls concurrently when solving multi-step problemsAdaptive reasoning, allowing the model to plan tool sequences over several turnsThis behavior aligns directly with the Agent Tools API’s purpose: to give Grok the external capabilities necessary for autonomous agent work.Benchmark Results Demonstrating Highest Agentic PerformancexAI released a set of benchmark results intended to illustrate how Grok 4.1 Fast performs when paired with the Agent Tools API, emphasizing scenarios that rely on tool calling, long-context reasoning, and multi-step task execution. On τ²-bench Telecom, a benchmark built to replicate real-world customer-support workflows involving tool use, Grok 4.1 Fast achieved the highest score among all listed models — outpacing even Google&#x27;s new Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s recent 5.1 on high reasoning — while also achieving among the lowest prices for developers and users. The evaluation, independently verified by Artificial Analysis, cost $105 to complete and served as one of xAI’s central claims of superiority in agentic performance.In structured function-calling tests, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning recorded a 72 percent overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling v4 benchmark, a result accompanied by a reported cost of $400 for the run. xAI noted that Gemini 3 Pro’s comparative result in this benchmark stemmed from independent estimates rather than an official submission, leaving some uncertainty in cross-model comparisons.Long-horizon evaluations further underscored the model’s design emphasis on stability across large contexts. In multi-turn tests involving extended dialog and expanded context windows, Grok 4.1 Fast outperformed both Grok 4 Fast and the earlier Grok 4, aligning with xAI’s claims that long-horizon reinforcement learning helped mitigate the typical degradation seen in models operating at the two-million-token scale.A second cluster of benchmarks—Research-Eval, FRAMES, and X Browse—highlighted Grok 4.1 Fast’s capabilities in tool-augmented research tasks. Across all three evaluations, Grok 4.1 Fast paired with the Agent Tools API earned the highest scores among the models with published results. It also delivered the lowest average cost per query in Research-Eval and FRAMES, reinforcing xAI’s messaging on cost-efficient research performance. In X Browse, an internal xAI benchmark assessing multihop search capabilities across the X platform, Grok 4.1 Fast again led its peers, though Gemini 3 Pro lacked cost data for direct comparison.Developer Pricing and Temporary Free AccessAPI pricing for Grok 4.1 Fast is as follows:Input tokens: $0.20 per 1MCached input tokens: $0.05 per 1MOutput tokens: $0.50 per 1MTool calls: From $5 per 1,000 successful tool invocationsTo facilitate early experimentation:Grok 4.1 Fast is free on OpenRouter until December 3rd.The Agent Tools API is also free through December 3rd via the xAI API.When paying for the models outside of the free period, Grok 4.1 Fast reasoning and non-reasoning are both among the cheaper options from major frontier labs through their own APIs.

Across multiple agentic and function-calling benchmarks, the model consistently outperforms or matches leading systems like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1 (high), and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, while operating inside a far more economical cost envelope. At $0.70 per million tokens, both Grok 4.1 Fast variants sit only marginally above ultracheap models like Qwen 3 Turbo but deliver accuracy levels in line with systems that cost 10–20× more per unit. The τ²-bench Telecom results reinforce this value proposition: Grok 4.1 Fast not only achieved the highest score in its test cohort but also appears to be the lowest-cost model in that benchmark run. In practical terms, this gives enterprises an unusually favorable cost-to-intelligence ratio, particularly for workloads involving multistep planning, tool use, and long-context reasoning.However, performance and pricing are only part of the equation for organizations considering large-scale adoption. The recent “glazing” controversy from Grok’s consumer deployment on X — combined with the earlier \"MechaHitler\" and \"White Genocid\" incidents — expose credibility and trust-surface risks that enterprises cannot ignore. Even if the API models are technically distinct from the consumer-facing variant, the inability to prevent sycophantic, adversarially-induced bias in a high-visibility environment raises legitimate concerns about downstream reliability in operational contexts. Enterprise procurement teams will rightly ask whether similar vulnerabilities—preference skew, alignment drift, or context-sensitive bias—could surface when Grok is connected to production databases, workflow engines, code-execution tools, or research pipelines.The introduction of the Agent Tools API raises the stakes further. Grok 4.1 Fast is not just a text generator—it is now an orchestrator of web searches, X-data queries, document retrieval operations, and remote Python execution. These agentic capabilities amplify productivity but also expand the blast radius of any misalignment. A model that can over-index on flattering a public figure could, in principle, also misprioritize results, mis-handle safety boundaries, or deliver skewed interpretations when operating with real-world data. Enterprises therefore need a clear understanding of how xAI isolates, audits, and hardens its API models relative to the consumer-facing Grok whose failures drove the latest scrutiny.The result is a mixed strategic picture. On performance and price, Grok 4.1 Fast is highly competitive—arguably one of the strongest value propositions in the modern LLM market. But xAI’s enterprise appeal will ultimately depend on whether the company can convincingly demonstrate that the alignment instability, susceptibility to adversarial prompting, and bias-amplifying behavior observed on X do not translate into its developer-facing platform. Without transparent safeguards, auditability, and reproducible evaluation across the very tools that enable autonomous operation, organizations may hesitate to commit core workloads to a system whose reliability is still the subject of public doubt. For now, Grok 4.1 Fast is a technically impressive and economically efficient option—one that enterprises should test, benchmark, and validate rigorously before allowing it to take on mission-critical tas",

          "standfirst": "Infographics rendered without a single spelling error. Complex diagrams one-shotted from paragraph prompts. Logos restored from fragments. And visual outputs so sharp with so much text density and accuracy, one developer simply called it “absolutely bonkers.”Google DeepMind’s newly released Nano Banana Pro—officially Gemini 3 Pro Image—has drawn astonishment from both the developer community and enterprise AI engineers. But behind the viral praise lies something more transformative: a model built not just to impress, but to integrate deeply across Google’s AI stack—from Gemini API and Vertex AI to Workspace apps, Ads, and Google AI Studio.Unlike earlier image models, which targeted casual users or artistic use cases, Gemini 3 Pro Image introduces studio-quality, multimodal image generation for structured workflows—with high resolution, multilingual accuracy, layout consistency, and real-time knowledge grounding. It’s engineered for technical buyers, orchestration teams, and enterprise-scale automation, not just creative exploration.Benchmarks already show the model outperforming peers in overall visual quality, infographic generation, and text rendering accuracy. And as real-world users push it to its limits—from medical illustrations to AI memes—the model is revealing itself as both a new creative tool and a visual reasoning system for the enterprise stack.Built for Structured Multimodal ReasoningGemini 3 Pro Image isn’t just drawing pretty pictures—it’s leveraging the reasoning layer of Gemini 3 Pro to generate visuals that communicate structure, intent, and factual grounding. The model is capable of generating UX flows, educational diagrams, storyboards, and mockups from language prompts, and can incorporate up to 14 source images with consistent identity and layout fidelity across subjects.Google describes the model as “a higher-fidelity model built on Gemini 3 Pro for developers to access studio-quality image generation,” and confirms it is now available via Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI for enterprise access.In Antigravity, Google’s new AI vibe coding platform built by the former Windsurf co-founders it hired earlier this year, Gemini 3 Pro Image is already being used to create dynamic UI prototypes with image assets rendered before code is written. The same capabilities are rolling out to Google’s enterprise-facing products like Workspace Vids, Slides, and Google Ads, giving teams precise control over asset layout, lighting, typography, and image composition.High-Resolution Output, Localization, and Real-Time GroundingThe model supports output resolutions of up to 2K and 4K, and includes studio-level controls over camera angle, color grading, focus, and lighting. It handles multilingual prompts, semantic localization, and in-image text translation, enabling workflows like:Translating packaging or signage while preserving layoutUpdating UX mockups for regional marketsGenerating consistent ad variants with product names and pricing changed by localeOne of the clearest use cases is infographics—both technical and commercial. Dr. Derya Unutmaz, an immunologist, generated a full medical illustration describing the stages of CAR-T cell therapy from lab to patient, praising the result as “perfect.” AI educator Dan Mac created a visual guide explaining transformer models “for a non-technical person” and called the result “unbelievable.”Even complex structured visuals like full restaurant menus, chalkboard lecture visuals, or multi-character comic strips have been shared online—generated in a single prompt, with coherent typography, layout, and subject continuity.Benchmarks Signal a Lead in Compositional Image GenerationIndependent GenAI-Bench results show Gemini 3 Pro Image as a state-of-the-art performer across key categories:It ranks highest in overall user preference, suggesting strong visual coherence and prompt alignment.It leads in visual quality, ahead of competitors like GPT-Image 1 and Seedream v4.Most notably, it dominates in infographic generation, outscoring even Google’s own previous model, Gemini 2.5 Flash.Additional benchmarks released by Google show Gemini 3 Pro Image with lower text error rates across multiple languages, as well as stronger performance in image editing fidelity.The difference becomes especially apparent in structured reasoning tasks. Where previous models might approximate style or fill in layout gaps, Gemini 3 Pro Image demonstrates consistency across panels, accurate spatial relationships, and context-aware detail preservation—crucial for systems generating diagrams, documentation, or training visuals at scale.Pricing Is Competitive for the QualityFor developers and enterprise teams accessing Gemini 3 Pro Image via the Gemini API or Google AI Studio, pricing is tiered by resolution and usage. Input tokens for images are priced at $0.0011 per image (equivalent to 560 tokens or $0.067 per image), while output pricing depends on resolution: standard 1K and 2K images cost approximately $0.134 each (1,120 tokens), and high-resolution 4K images cost $0.24 (2,000 tokens). Text input and output are priced in line with Gemini 3 Pro: $2.00 per million input tokens and $12.00 per million output tokens when using the model’s reasoning capabilities. The free tier currently does not include access to Nano Banana Pro, and unlike free-tier models, the paid-tier generations are not used to train Google’s systems.Here’s a comparison table of major image-generation APIs for developers/enterprises, followed by a discussion of how they stack up (including the tiered pricing for Gemini 3 Pro Image / “Nano Banana Pro”).Model / ServiceApproximate Price per Image or Token-UnitKey Notes / Resolution TiersGoogle – Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)Input (image): ~$0.067 per image (560 tokens). Output: ~$0.134 per image for 1K/2K (1120 tokens), ~$0.24 per image for 4K (2000 tokens). Text: $2.00 per million input tokens & $12.00 per million output tokens (≤200k token context) Tiered by resolution; paid-tier images are not used to train Google’s systems.OpenAI – DALL-E 3 API~ $0.04/image for 1024×1024 standard; ~$0.08/image for larger/resolution/HD. Lower cost per image; resolution and quality tiers adjust pricing.OpenAI – GPT-Image-1 (via Azure/OpenAI)Low tier ~$0.01/image; Medium ~$0.04/image; High ~$0.17/image. Token-based pricing – more complex prompts or higher resolution raise cost.Google – Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana)~$0.039 per image for 1024×1024 resolution (1290 tokens) in output. Lower cost “flash” model for high-volume, lower latency use.Other / Smaller APIs (e.g., via third-party credit systems)Examples: $0.02–$0.03 per image in some cases for lower resolution or simpler models. Often used for less demanding production use cases or draft content.The Google Gemini 3 Pro Image / Nano Banana Pro pricing sits at the upper end: ~$0.134 for 1K/2K, ~$0.24 for 4K, significantly higher than the ~$0.04 per image baseline for many OpenAI/DALL-E 3 standard images. But the higher cost might be justifiable if: you require 4K resolution; you need enterprise-grade governance (e.g., Google emphasizes that paid-tier images are not used to train their systems); you need a token-based pricing system aligned with other LLM usage; and you already operate within Google’s cloud/AI stack (e.g., using Vertex AI).On the other hand, if you’re generating large volumes of images (thousands to tens of thousands) and can accept lower resolution (1K/2K) or slightly less premium quality, the lower-cost alternatives (OpenAI, smaller models) offer meaningful savings — for instance, generating 10,000 images at ~$0.04 each costs ~$400, whereas at ~$0.134 each it’s ~$1,340. Over time, that delta adds up.SynthID and the Growing Need for Enterprise ProvenanceEvery image generated by Gemini 3 Pro Image includes SynthID, Google’s imperceptible digital watermarking system. While many platforms are just beginning to explore AI provenance, Google is positioning SynthID as a core part of its enterprise compliance stack.In the updated Gemini app, users can now upload an image and ask whether it was AI-generated by Google—a feature designed to support growing regulatory and internal governance demands.A Google blog post emphasizes that provenance is no longer a “feature” but an operational requirement, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, education, and media. SynthID also allows teams building on Google Cloud to differentiate between AI-generated content and third-party media across assets, use logs, and audit trails.Early Developer Reactions Range from Awe to Edge-Case TestingDespite the enterprise framing, early developer reactions have turned social media into a real-time proving ground.Designer Travis Davids called out a one-shot restaurant menu with flawless layout and typography: “Long generated text is officially solved.” Immunologist Dr. Derya Unutmaz posted his CAR-T diagram with the caption: “What have you done, Google?!” while Nikunj Kothari converted a full essay into a stylized blackboard lecture in one shot, calling the results “simply speechless.”Engineer Deedy Das praised its performance across editing and brand restoration tasks: “Photoshop-like editing… It nails everything...By far the best image model I&#x27;ve ever seen.” Developer Parker Ortolani summarized it more simply: “Nano Banana remains absolutely bonkers.”Even meme creators got involved. @cto_junior generated a fully styled “LLM discourse desk” meme—with logos, charts, monitors, and all—in one prompt, dubbing Gemini 3 Pro Image “your new meme engine.”But scrutiny followed, too. AI researcher Lisan al Gaib tested the model on a logic-heavy Sudoku problem, showing it hallucinated both an invalid puzzle and a nonsensical solution, noting that the model “is sadly not AGI.” The post served as a reminder that visual reasoning has limits, particularly in rule-constrained systems where hallucinated logic remains a persistent failure mode.A New Platform Primitive, Not Just a ModelGemini 3 Pro Image now lives across Google’s entire enterprise and developer stack: Google Ads, Workspace (Slides, Vids), Vertex AI, Gemini API, and Google AI Studio. It’s also deployed in internal tools like Antigravity, where design agents render layout drafts before interface elements are coded.This makes it a first-class multimodal primitive inside Google’s AI ecosystem, much like text completion or speech recognition. In enterprise applications, visuals are not decorations—they’re data, documentation, design, and communication. Whether generating onboarding explainers, prototype visuals, or localized collateral, models like Gemini 3 Pro Image allow systems to create assets programmatically, with control, scale, and consistency.At a time when the race between OpenAI, Google, and xAI is moving beyond benchmarks and into platforms, Nano Banana Pro is Google’s quiet declaration: the future of generative AI won’t just be spoken or written—it will be seen.",

While many platforms are just beginning to explore AI provenance, Google is positioning SynthID as a core part of its enterprise compliance stack.In the updated Gemini app, users can now upload an image and ask whether it was AI-generated by Google—a feature designed to support growing regulatory and internal governance demands.A Google blog post emphasizes that provenance is no longer a “feature” but an operational requirement, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, education, and media. SynthID also allows teams building on Google Cloud to differentiate between AI-generated content and third-party media across assets, use logs, and audit trails.Early Developer Reactions Range from Awe to Edge-Case TestingDespite the enterprise framing, early developer reactions have turned social media into a real-time proving ground.Designer Travis Davids called out a one-shot restaurant menu with flawless layout and typography: “Long generated text is officially solved.” Immunologist Dr. Derya Unutmaz posted his CAR-T diagram with the caption: “What have you done, Google?!” while Nikunj Kothari converted a full essay into a stylized blackboard lecture in one shot, calling the results “simply speechless.”Engineer Deedy Das praised its performance across editing and brand restoration tasks: “Photoshop-like editing… It nails everything...By far the best image model I&#x27;ve ever seen.” Developer Parker Ortolani summarized it more simply: “Nano Banana remains absolutely bonkers.”Even meme creators got involved. @cto_junior generated a fully styled “LLM discourse desk” meme—with logos, charts, monitors, and all—in one prompt, dubbing Gemini 3 Pro Image “your new meme engine.”But scrutiny followed, too. AI researcher Lisan al Gaib tested the model on a logic-heavy Sudoku problem, showing it hallucinated both an invalid puzzle and a nonsensical solution, noting that the model “is sadly not AGI.” The post served as a reminder that visual reasoning has limits, particularly in rule-constrained systems where hallucinated logic remains a persistent failure mode.A New Platform Primitive, Not Just a ModelGemini 3 Pro Image now lives across Google’s entire enterprise and developer stack: Google Ads, Workspace (Slides, Vids), Vertex AI, Gemini API, and Google AI Studio. It’s also deployed in internal tools like Antigravity, where design agents render layout drafts before interface elements are coded.This makes it a first-class multimodal primitive inside Google’s AI ecosystem, much like text completion or speech recognition. In enterprise applications, visuals are not decorations—they’re data, documentation, design, and communication. Whether generating onboarding explainers, prototype visuals, or localized collateral, models like Gemini 3 Pro Image allow systems to create assets programmatically, with control, scale, and consistency.At a time when the race between OpenAI, Google, and xAI is moving beyond benchmarks and into platforms, Nano Banana Pro is Google’s quiet declaration: the future of generative AI won’t just be spoken or written—it will be seen.",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday Apple deals are already trickling in, and one of the best we're tracking is on the AirPods 4. They're down to $80 right now, which is a new record low. While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. Elsewhere when it comes to Black Friday AirPods deals, you can pick up the AirPods 4 with ANC for only $110, and the new AirPods Pro 3 for $220.

          "standfirst": "As the future of physical media looks increasingly grim, it feels like more and more gaming enthusiasts are turning to the classics, back to a time when buying a game meant actually owning it, and the games themselves were more willing to be complete thoughts rather than endless services. If you know someone who has fallen down the old-games rabbit hole, we’ve rounded up a few retro-themed gift ideas that should delight this holiday season, from video upscalers to portable consoles to vintage wall art. Best retro gaming gifts FAQs Why do people buy retro games? Because they’re fun! Or because video game companies have generally had a spotty record of preserving their own history — and (legally) saving art, even in a minuscule way, is important. Or because, deep down, collectors just want to stave off the ceaseless march of time and hang onto any way to relive their youth before it dissipates for good. Or because they’re jaded with modern game design and crave shorter, more distinct or altogether different experiences that aren’t being served by today’s market. Or because they want to flip the games they collect for a quick buck on eBay. Or because… well, you get the idea. — J.D. Why is retro gaming so expensive? To put it simply: supply and demand. Companies aren’t making old games and consoles any more, yet a growing number of gaming enthusiasts want them. And as retro game collecting has grown more popular, sellers have become more acutely aware of how high they can price their goods. Not every retro game costs an arm and a leg, however: Popular games from relatively recent consoles are usually more affordable than lesser-selling titles for older hardware, and you can still find a good bargain every now and then by digging through local yard sales, individual eBay sellers and the like. — J.D. Are retro games a good investment? It depends on how you define “good.” Is it a good idea to buy a bunch of old games in the hopes that their value will skyrocket and make you a tidy profit? No, there’s little rhyme or reason to determining exactly which games will shoot up in value and by how much. There are much safer ways to invest if all you care about are financial returns. Is it a good idea to drop a bunch of cash on 40-year-old video games if you have pressing financial responsibilities? Probably not! But hey, it’s your life. If collecting retro games makes you happy, and you can budget for them within reason, that’s a good thing. Have fun. — J.D. What qualifies as a retro game? There’s no set definition for when a video game becomes “retro.” Personally, I think of it as any game that’s at least 10 years old and was originally released on a console that’s two or more generations old (or, for PC games, during that generation). But many others would stretch the timeline back farther, and the growing advent of “live service” games has complicated things. For instance, Grand Theft Auto V was released in 2013, while World of Warcraft arrived in 2004 — are those “retro games” when millions of people still play them today? Maybe not. With games from the ‘90s or earlier, though, the distinction is clearer. — J.D.

          "standfirst": "November has turned into Black Friday and vice versa. What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $280 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum for $270 (55 percent off): Any time you can get a Dyson for under $300, it's a deal to consider. This V9 Motorbar is an older model, but it still has excellent suction power, 40 minutes of runtime and it comes with four attachments that let you clean everything from your floors to your couch to the inside of your car. Don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles starting November 21. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.

TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low.

          "content": "November has turned into Black Friday and vice versa. What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $280 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum for $270 (55 percent off): Any time you can get a Dyson for under $300, it's a deal to consider. This V9 Motorbar is an older model, but it still has excellent suction power, 40 minutes of runtime and it comes with four attachments that let you clean everything from your floors to your couch to the inside of your car. Don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles starting November 21. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease.

          "title": "Ooni Volt 2 review: A strong case for an indoor pizza oven",
          "standfirst": "Two years ago, Ooni brought the pizza party indoors with the Volt 12. With that device, the company entered new territory and proved that its brand of outdoor cooking could be transformed for use in home kitchens. That model wasn’t without its flaws though, including its bulky stature and high price. Still, it impressed me enough to earn a spot on our best pizza ovens list. With the Volt 2 ($699), Ooni completely overhauled its concept of what an electric indoor pizza oven could be. That starts with a more polished design that’s slightly smaller than the first generation. The company also reconfigured the controls, creating a button-based system that’s easier to understand and centers on newly developed Pizza Intelligence technology. Given Ooni’s track record for consistency and performance, it shouldn’t be any surprise that the Volt 2 is another hit for the pizza oven maker. Design updates As part of Ooni’s redesign for the Volt 2, the exterior looks completely different, right down to the updated controls and large digital display. This new model has a more refined, more modern aesthetic — one that will certainly fit in amongst today’s small kitchen appliances. The overall design is softer and rounder where the first version was angular and blocky. Plus, Ooni opted for a white version in addition to its standard gray, giving you the ability to choose the one that fits in your kitchen best. There’s also a new orange-ish light that shines down onto the counter, or whatever surface you have the Volt 2 on, which serves as an indicator that the oven is preheating. Up front, a collection of buttons have replaced the three control knobs and tiny dials from the Volt 12. There’s one for each of Ooni’s new Pizza Intelligence-powered presets and there are additional options for dough proofing, oven and broil/grill modes. The last two buttons in the main cluster on the left side are for saving custom presets. Closer to the center, there are three buttons for temperature control, crisping intensity and the timer. To set any of those, you’ll use the larger silver knob all the way to the right. This knob also doubles as the boost activation when you need extra power from the top heating element. Ooni also installed a new digital display on the front, giving you temperature and timer updates at a glance. This is a huge improvement over the dials on the Volt 12, which couldn’t be read from a distance. With the large numbers on the Volt 2, I can just walk to the door of the kitchen and peek in if I want an update on the preheating process. There are other refinements, like the larger viewing window on the front door, but a major one is the size reduction for the Volt 2. Don’t get me wrong, this is still a large device; it’s about the size of a low-profile microwave. It’s also still quite heavy at nearly 39 pounds. But Ooni did manage to shave a few inches here and there, and when combined with the rounder design cues, this makes the Volt 2 seem like it isn’t as massive or imposing as the Volt 12. New features The Volt 2's preset and mode buttons. Billy Steele for Engadget Nearly all of the Volt 2’s new features center around what Ooni calls Pizza Intelligence. The technology is an adaptive control system for the oven that uses unique heating elements and internal sensors. The setup can adjust the oven’s temperature in real time “for speed, accuracy and baking consistency,” according to the company. This technology serves as the basis for those style-based presets I already mentioned. More specifically, the Volt 2’s presets include Neapolitan, Thin & Crispy and Pan Pizza that enable you to start cooking without much thought to time and temperature. All of these can be adjusted as each one has a temperature range for further fine tuning. Each one also has its unique crisping intensity and cook temperature, both of which can also be tweaked as needed. After using all of the presets during testing, I like that Ooni made its second pizza oven easier to use for beginners. Even though I have some at-home pizza making experience (thanks COVID-19), it was nice to not worry about time and temperature in my research and planning. For more advanced users, the ability to use the presets as a starting point and tweak the parameters ensures that the Volt 2 remains a staple in the kitchen for a long time. Plus, the two slots for completely custom presets means Ooni experts will have space to save their refined, personalized configurations. Making pizza with the Volt 2 New York-style dough is baking with the Thin & Crispy preset on the Volt 2. Billy Steele for Engadget You’re probably wondering how good the pizza is out of this thing, right? After all, the design prowess, features and specs mean nothing if the end result is terrible. That’s not the case here, nor has it been on any Ooni oven I’ve tested. I particularly enjoy baking pizzas with the Volt 2 (and the Volt 12 before) because I can do so in the comfort of my own kitchen. Everything I might need in a pinch is close by and there’s no open flame to maintain or monitor for safety. First, let’s discuss preheating. Ooni says the Volt 2 can be ready to cook pizza in 12 minutes, and I suppose that’s true if you’re doing a lower-temperature bake. In my tests, the oven took exactly 25 minutes to get to its 850-degree Fahrenheit maximum (ideal for Neapolitan pies) and just over 18 minutes to hit 660 degrees. That latter figure is the target temperature of the Thin & Crispy preset, which was my favorite of the three Pizza Intelligence options. Both of these save time over using your home oven since a lot of recipes tell you to preheat that appliance for an hour. A major consideration with the Volt 2 is pizza size. The oven’s baking stone can accommodate 12-inch pizzas, which means family pizza night will entail everyone making their own or baking multiple pies at the very least. For my family, I made four during my Neapolitan test, stretching and topping each new pizza after the previous one finished baking. After removing a pizza, the stone temperature drops, but the Volt 2’s Boost feature uses a 45-second burst to help it recover. I found that by the time I carefully stretched and topped the dough, the oven was ready for the next pizza. Neapolitan-style pizza baked with the Volt 2 preset has ample leoparding. Billy Steele for Engadget Across Neapolitan, Thin & Crispy and Pan Pizza modes, the Volt 2 produced truly stellar results for each style. I’ll note that I used dough recipes for each style from The Ooni Pizza Project by Scott Deley. I’ve found that his guidance leads to amazing pizzas, even if you’re planning to just use your home oven. Using the Volt 2, Neapolitan pies had ample leoparding and cooked quickly in the high heat. Thinner, New York-style pizza was indeed crispy on the bottom and perfectly browned on top while still having a pleasant chewiness. And my Detroit-style pan tests were crispy on the edges and pillowy soft inside. There are two important things to note about using the Volt 2. First, the exterior gets hot, especially at 800 degrees and above. For that reason, you’ll want to avoid sitting anything on top of the oven while you’re using it (or very close to it, really). You’ll also need to allow ample time for the outside to cool before storing the Volt 2. The oven runs its own shutdown cycle, but the exterior may still be too warm to put away when that’s complete. Second, despite a steam and smoke filter, the Volt 2 still expels steam out of the back. I combated this by putting the oven on my flat-top stove under the exhaust fan, but you’ll need to plan accordingly if you don’t want that wafting around your kitchen. I could see this being a problem for small living spaces like apartments. The competition If you’re looking for Volt alternatives, there are two main competitors. The long-standing incumbent is Breville’s Pizzaiolo. It too offers easy-to-use presets and features in addition to a degree of manual operation. My main issue with it was the price, which was initially $1,000 but is now $800. That reduced price is still $100 more than the Volt 2. I also had trouble with the confined round baking area and how difficult the oven is to clean since debris could fall down around the bottom heating element. There’s also the Current Model P. This one wins the price war at under $500 and it too has presets and a max temperature of 850 degrees. Current’s app has a Pizza Build Calculator that assists with time, temperature and ingredients. I haven’t tested this one yet, but it’s on my list for the near future. Wrap-up The Volt 2 has a square baking area that can fit 12-inch pizzas. Billy Steele for Engadget There’s no sophomore slump here. The Volt 2 is a big upgrade over the original Volt — that much is undeniable. It’s easier to use for all skill levels thanks to its clearer controls and large display. Presets work well, but they can also serve as a starting point for further recipe refinement for experienced users. And the pizza — my goodness, the pizza is consistently restaurant quality (or better) across a range of styles. Combine that performance with a better looking design, slightly smaller footprint and lower starting price and you’ve got a compelling case for a standalone indoor pizza oven.

          "content": "Two years ago, Ooni brought the pizza party indoors with the Volt 12. With that device, the company entered new territory and proved that its brand of outdoor cooking could be transformed for use in home kitchens. That model wasn’t without its flaws though, including its bulky stature and high price. Still, it impressed me enough to earn a spot on our best pizza ovens list. With the Volt 2 ($699), Ooni completely overhauled its concept of what an electric indoor pizza oven could be. That starts with a more polished design that’s slightly smaller than the first generation. The company also reconfigured the controls, creating a button-based system that’s easier to understand and centers on newly developed Pizza Intelligence technology. Given Ooni’s track record for consistency and performance, it shouldn’t be any surprise that the Volt 2 is another hit for the pizza oven maker. Design updates As part of Ooni’s redesign for the Volt 2, the exterior looks completely different, right down to the updated controls and large digital display. This new model has a more refined, more modern aesthetic — one that will certainly fit in amongst today’s small kitchen appliances. The overall design is softer and rounder where the first version was angular and blocky. Plus, Ooni opted for a white version in addition to its standard gray, giving you the ability to choose the one that fits in your kitchen best. There’s also a new orange-ish light that shines down onto the counter, or whatever surface you have the Volt 2 on, which serves as an indicator that the oven is preheating. Up front, a collection of buttons have replaced the three control knobs and tiny dials from the Volt 12. There’s one for each of Ooni’s new Pizza Intelligence-powered presets and there are additional options for dough proofing, oven and broil/grill modes. The last two buttons in the main cluster on the left side are for saving custom presets. Closer to the center, there are three buttons for temperature control, crisping intensity and the timer. To set any of those, you’ll use the larger silver knob all the way to the right. This knob also doubles as the boost activation when you need extra power from the top heating element. Ooni also installed a new digital display on the front, giving you temperature and timer updates at a glance. This is a huge improvement over the dials on the Volt 12, which couldn’t be read from a distance. With the large numbers on the Volt 2, I can just walk to the door of the kitchen and peek in if I want an update on the preheating process. There are other refinements, like the larger viewing window on the front door, but a major one is the size reduction for the Volt 2. Don’t get me wrong, this is still a large device; it’s about the size of a low-profile microwave. It’s also still quite heavy at nearly 39 pounds. But Ooni did manage to shave a few inches here and there, and when combined with the rounder design cues, this makes the Volt 2 seem like it isn’t as massive or imposing as the Volt 12. New features The Volt 2's preset and mode buttons. Billy Steele for Engadget Nearly all of the Volt 2’s new features center around what Ooni calls Pizza Intelligence. The technology is an adaptive control system for the oven that uses unique heating elements and internal sensors. The setup can adjust the oven’s temperature in real time “for speed, accuracy and baking consistency,” according to the company. This technology serves as the basis for those style-based presets I already mentioned. More specifically, the Volt 2’s presets include Neapolitan, Thin & Crispy and Pan Pizza that enable you to start cooking without much thought to time and temperature. All of these can be adjusted as each one has a temperature range for further fine tuning. Each one also has its unique crisping intensity and cook temperature, both of which can also be tweaked as needed. After using all of the presets during testing, I like that Ooni made its second pizza oven easier to use for beginners. Even though I have some at-home pizza making experience (thanks COVID-19), it was nice to not worry about time and temperature in my research and planning. For more advanced users, the ability to use the presets as a starting point and tweak the parameters ensures that the Volt 2 remains a staple in the kitchen for a long time. Plus, the two slots for completely custom presets means Ooni experts will have space to save their refined, personalized configurations.

We’re big fans of the brand’s charging gear and accessories — Anker has earned kudos in a number of our buying guides, from power banks to wireless chargers. Now for Black Friday, a whole slew of the company’s gear is on sale, and some are hitting the best prices we’ve seen this year. So if you’re looking for dependable sidekicks and the supporting players that keep your heavy hitters in business, check out the best Anker Black Friday deals we could find. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and let you play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to the wall. Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

Here you’ll find only the best electronics for less than $50 a pop. These are all gadgets and accessories we’ve tested for our buying guides, recommended in our gift guides or reviewed for, well, our reviews. For less than $50, you can pick up Engadget-approved gear like earbuds, smart speakers, streaming sticks, power banks, smart plugs, Bluetooth trackers and more. So if you need accessories to support your bigger devices, or want a few clever gadgets to smarten up your space, check out the best Black Friday tech deals for under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $2 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. It’s 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $20 ($7 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-live-apple-airtags-legos-blink-cameras-ugreen-chargers-and-more-173833363.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Some people shop Black Friday sales for discounts on shoes and socket wrenches, duvet covers and blow up mattresses — none of those things are on this list. Here you’ll find only the best electronics for less than $50 a pop. These are all gadgets and accessories we’ve tested for our buying guides, recommended in our gift guides or reviewed for, well, our reviews. For less than $50, you can pick up Engadget-approved gear like earbuds, smart speakers, streaming sticks, power banks, smart plugs, Bluetooth trackers and more. So if you need accessories to support your bigger devices, or want a few clever gadgets to smarten up your space, check out the best Black Friday tech deals for under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $2 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. It’s 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $20 ($7 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art.

Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-live-apple-airtags-legos-blink-cameras-ugreen-chargers-and-more-173833363.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "These days, Black Friday is the longest day of the year. We're only halfway through November, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $420 (50 percent off): Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-deals-2025-early-sales-on-fubo-rosetta-stone-headspace-and-more-180000874.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’re looking to grab a new SSD for a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget, Black Friday is typically a good time to take the plunge. To help you separate the fake discounts from the stuff worth your time, we’ve picked through the many sales going on now and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could find below. So far we’re seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth calling out. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off MSRP): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. If you want more space, the 512GB version of the Play Pro is also on sale for $99. That’s not an all-time low, but it’s about $15 off that card’s average street price in recent months and as cheap as any other 512GB microSD Express model we can find in stock right now. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Likewise, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Amazon ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. White this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-and-other-storage-devices-we-can-find-175429637.html?src=rss",

The AI Infra Product announced today, extends the company’s existing automation capabilities to address a growing need for efficient GPU utilization, predictable performance, and reduced operational burden in large-scale AI deployments. The company said the system is already running in enterprise production environments and delivering major efficiency gains for early adopters, reducing GPU costs by between 50% and 70%, according to the company. The company does not publicly list enterprise pricing for this solution and instead invites interested customers to receive a custom quote based on their operation size and needs here.In explaining how the system behaves under heavy load, Yodar Shafrir, CEO and Co-Founder of ScaleOps, said in an email to VentureBeat that the platform uses “proactive and reactive mechanisms to handle sudden spikes without performance impact,” noting that its workload rightsizing policies “automatically manage capacity to keep resources available.” He added that minimizing GPU cold-start delays was a priority, emphasizing that the system “ensures instant response when traffic surges,” particularly for AI workloads where model load times are substantial.Expanding Resource Automation to AI InfrastructureEnterprises deploying self-hosted AI models face performance variability, long load times, and persistent underutilization of GPU resources. ScaleOps positioned the new AI Infra Product as a direct response to these issues. The platform allocates and scales GPU resources in real time and adapts to changes in traffic demand without requiring alterations to existing model deployment pipelines or application code.According to ScaleOps, the system manages production environments for organizations including Wiz, DocuSign, Rubrik, Coupa, Alkami, Vantor, Grubhub, Island, Chewy, and several Fortune 500 companies. The AI Infra Product introduces workload-aware scaling policies that proactively and reactively adjust capacity to maintain performance during demand spikes. The company stated that these policies reduce the cold-start delays associated with loading large AI models, which improves responsiveness when traffic increases.Technical Integration and Platform CompatibilityThe product is designed for compatibility with common enterprise infrastructure patterns. It works across all Kubernetes distributions, major cloud platforms, on-premises data centers, and air-gapped environments. ScaleOps emphasized that deployment does not require code changes, infrastructure rewrites, or modifications to existing manifests. Shafrir said the platform “integrates seamlessly into existing model deployment pipelines without requiring any code or infrastructure changes,” and he added that teams can begin optimizing immediately with their existing GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment tooling.Shafrir also addressed how the automation interacts with existing systems. He said the platform operates without disrupting workflows or creating conflicts with custom scheduling or scaling logic, explaining that the system “doesn’t change manifests or deployment logic” and instead enhances schedulers, autoscalers, and custom policies by incorporating real-time operational context while respecting existing configuration boundaries.Performance, Visibility, and User ControlThe platform provides full visibility into GPU utilization, model behavior, performance metrics, and scaling decisions at multiple levels, including pods, workloads, nodes, and clusters. While the system applies default workload scaling policies, ScaleOps noted that engineering teams retain the ability to tune these policies as needed.In practice, the company aims to reduce or eliminate the manual tuning that DevOps and AIOps teams typically perform to manage AI workloads. Installation is intended to require minimal effort, described by ScaleOps as a two-minute process using a single helm flag, after which optimization can be enabled through a single action.Cost Savings and Enterprise Case StudiesScaleOps reported that early deployments of the AI Infra Product have achieved GPU cost reductions of 50–70% in customer environments. The company cited two examples:A major creative software company operating thousands of GPUs averaged 20% utilization before adopting ScaleOps. The product increased utilization, consolidated underused capacity, and enabled GPU nodes to scale down. These changes reduced overall GPU spending by more than half. The company also reported a 35% reduction in latency for key workloads.A global gaming company used the platform to optimize a dynamic LLM workload running on hundreds of GPUs. According to ScaleOps, the product increased utilization by a factor of seven while maintaining service-level performance. The customer projected $1.4 million in annual savings from this workload alone.ScaleOps stated that the expected GPU savings typically outweigh the cost of adopting and operating the platform, and that customers with limited infrastructure budgets have reported fast returns on investment.Industry Context and Company PerspectiveThe rapid adoption of self-hosted AI models has created new operational challenges for enterprises, particularly around GPU efficiency and the complexity of managing large-scale workloads. Shafrir described the broader landscape as one in which “cloud-native AI infrastructure is reaching a breaking point.”“Cloud-native architectures unlocked great flexibility and control, but they also introduced a new level of complexity,” he said in the announcement. “Managing GPU resources at scale has become chaotic—waste, performance issues, and skyrocketing costs are now the norm. The ScaleOps platform was built to fix this. It delivers the complete solution for managing and optimizing GPU resources in cloud-native environments, enabling enterprises to run LLMs and AI applications efficiently, cost-effectively, and while improving performance.”Shafrir added that the product brings together the full set of cloud resource management functions needed to manage diverse workloads at scale. The company positioned the platform as a holistic system for continuous, automated optimization.A Unified Approach for the FutureWith the addition of the AI Infra Product, ScaleOps aims to establish a unified approach to GPU and AI workload management that integrates with existing enterprise infrastructure. The platform’s early performance metrics and reported cost savings suggest a focus on measurable efficiency improvements within the expanding ecosystem of self-hosted AI deployments.",

          "standfirst": "If you'd rather not spend the money on a brand new TV this year, you can make an old set feel new again with a streaming device. Our favorite streaming device is on sale right now for Black Friday: you can grab the Google TV Streamer 4K for only $75, which is the lowest price we've seen so far. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $85 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is a banner time to pick up some of the latest gear from Apple for a discount. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for, oh, 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3, a bunch of MacBooks and, of course, all models of the iPhone 17 lineup. Speaking of which, you won’t see iPhone deals represented here — service and contract-related discounts tend to make those savings a little too specific. But if you want to save on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, accessories or other Apple gear, look no further. These are the best Black Friday Apple deals we could find. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $110 ($69 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $89. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Best Buy: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Walmart and Amazon are selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $923 ($76 off) at Walmart: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $50 discount matches the lowest price we've seen. Also at B&H. It's $29 more at Amazon. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple MagSafe cable 25W for $23 ($17 off) at Best Buy: Apple leads the way in fast wireless charging, typically debuting faster wattage technology before other companies. The iPhone 17 can wirelessly recharge at 25-watt speeds with pads like this (or other Qi2 25W chargers). You can also get those speeds with iPhone 16 handsets that have updated to the latest OS 26 version. Just note that you’ll need to plug it into at least a 30 watt adapter, which isn’t included. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-apple-black-friday-deals-on-ipads-airpods-macbooks-apple-watches-and-airtags-are-already-up-to-39-percent-off-161346405.html?src=rss",

But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple MagSafe cable 25W for $23 ($17 off) at Best Buy: Apple leads the way in fast wireless charging, typically debuting faster wattage technology before other companies. The iPhone 17 can wirelessly recharge at 25-watt speeds with pads like this (or other Qi2 25W chargers). You can also get those speeds with iPhone 16 handsets that have updated to the latest OS 26 version. Just note that you’ll need to plug it into at least a 30 watt adapter, which isn’t included. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-apple-black-friday-deals-on-ipads-airpods-macbooks-apple-watches-and-airtags-are-already-up-to-39-percent-off-161346405.html?src=rss",

One of the best deals we've found is on the GoPro Hero 13 Black action cam, which is down to $310 for Black Friday. That's a discount of 23 percent or $90. This model topped our list of the best action cameras, and for good reason. It's a fantastic device with all kinds of bells and whistles. It's the most versatile Hero camera that GoPro has ever made. There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved. There's no internal storage here, but it accepts microSD cards. There's a camera bundle on sale right now that includes a 64GB microSD, three batteries, a dual charger and a case.

The DJI Neo was recently pushed off our list of the best drones in favor of the newer Neo 2, but the original is still a fantastic, budget-friendly option. We called it the \"best $200 drone ever made\" in our official review, and with good reason. It's quick, ultra-maneuverable and beginner-friendly. The learning curve here isn't that steep. It boasts four propeller guards, for safety, and the built-in 4K camera certainly gets the job done. It's extremely light, weighing just 135 grams. This makes it easy to transport, sure, but also means that the Neo is exempt from drone license requirements. This version doesn't ship with a dedicated controller, though there is a combo pack for that, but that doesn't really matter here.

Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board starting November 21, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. Also starting November 21, the DualSense Wireless Controller will be down to $60, a $20 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $170 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $180.

The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had.

However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over.

When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499.

Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30.

With more than 100 early customers already using the platform daily — over half spending more than an hour per day in the system — Lightfield is a direct challenge to the legacy business models of Salesforce and HubSpot, both of which generate billions in annual revenue.\"The CRM, categorically, is perhaps the most complex and lowest satisfaction piece of software on Earth,\" said Keith Peiris, Lightfield&#x27;s co-founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"CRM companies have tens of millions of users, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a single one who actually loves the product. That problem is our opportunity.\"The general availability announcement marks an unusual inflection point in enterprise software: a company betting that large language models have advanced enough to replace structured databases as the foundation of business-critical systems. It&#x27;s a wager that has attracted backing from Coatue Management, which led the company&#x27;s Series A when it was still building presentation software under the name Tome.How Tome&#x27;s founders abandoned 20 million users to build a CRM from scratchThe story behind Lightfield&#x27;s creation reflects both conviction and pragmatism. Tome had achieved significant viral success as an AI-powered presentation platform, gaining millions of users who appreciated its visual design and ease of use. But Peiris said the team concluded that building lasting differentiation in the general-purpose presentation market would prove difficult, even with a working product and real user traction.\"Tome went viral as an AI slides product, and it was visually delightful and easy to use—the first real generative AI-based presentation platform,\" Peiris explained. \"But, the more people used it, the more I realized that to really help people communicate something—anything—we needed more context.\"That realization led to a fundamental rethinking. The team observed that the most effective communication requires deep understanding of relationships, company dynamics, and ongoing conversations — context that exists most richly in sales and customer-facing roles. Rather than building a horizontal tool for everyone, they decided to build vertically for go-to-market teams.\"We chose this lane, &#x27;sales,&#x27; because so many people in these roles used Tome, and it seemed like the most logical place to go vertical,\" Peiris said. The team reduced headcount to a core group of engineers and spent a year building in stealth.Dan Rose, a senior advisor at Coatue who led the original investment in Tome, said the pivot validated his conviction in the founding team. \"It takes real guts to pivot, and even more so when the original product is working,\" Rose said. \"They shrunk the team down to a core group of engineers and got to work building Lightfield. This was not an easy product to build, it is extremely complex under the hood.\"Why Lightfield stores complete conversations instead of forcing data into fieldsWhat distinguishes Lightfield from traditional CRMs is architectural, not cosmetic. While Salesforce, HubSpot, and their competitors require users to define rigid data schemas upfront — dropdown menus, custom fields, checkbox categories — and then manually populate those fields after every interaction, Lightfield stores the complete, unstructured record of what customers actually say and do.\"Traditional CRMs force every interaction through predefined fields — they&#x27;re compressing rich, nuanced customer conversations into structured database entries,\" Peiris said. \"We store customer data in its raw, lossless form. That means we&#x27;re capturing significantly more detail and context than a traditional CRM ever could.\"In practice, this means the system automatically records and transcribes sales calls, ingests emails, monitors product usage, and maintains what the company calls a \"relationship timeline\" — a complete chronological record of every touchpoint between a company and its customers. AI models then extract structured information from this raw data on demand, allowing companies to reorganize their data model without manual rework.\"If you realize you need different fields or want to reorganize your schema entirely, the system can remap and refill itself automatically,\" Peiris explained. \"You&#x27;re not locked into decisions you made on day one when you barely understood your sales process.\"The system also generates meeting preparation briefs, drafts follow-up emails based on conversation context, and can be queried in natural language — capabilities that represent a departure from the passive database model that has defined CRMs since the category&#x27;s inception in the 1980s.Sales teams report reviving dead deals and cutting response times from months to daysCustomer testimonials suggest the automation delivers measurable impact, particularly for small teams without dedicated sales operations staff. Tyler Postle, co-founder of Voker.ai, said Lightfield&#x27;s AI agent helped him revive more than 40 stalled opportunities in a single two-hour session — leads he had neglected for six months while using HubSpot.\"Within 2 days, 10 of those were revived and became active opps that moved to poc,\" Postle said. \"The problem was, instead of being a tool of action and autotracking—HubSpot was a tool where I had to do the work to record customer convos. Using HubSpot I was a data hygienist. Using Lighfield, I’m a closer.\"Postle reported that his response times to prospects improved from weeks or months to one or two days, a change noticeable enough that customers commented on it. \"Our prospects and customers have even noticed it,\" he said.Radu Spineanu, co-founder of Humble Ops, highlighted a specific feature that addresses what he views as the primary cause of lost deals: simple neglect. \"The killer feature is asking &#x27;who haven&#x27;t I followed up with?&#x27;\" Spineanu said. \"Most deals die from neglect, not rejection. Lightfield catches these dropped threads and can draft and send the follow-up immediately. That&#x27;s prevented at least three deals from going cold this quarter.\"Spineanu had evaluated competing modern CRMs including Attio and Clay before selecting Lightfield, dismissing Salesforce and HubSpot as \"built for a different era.\" He said those platforms assume companies have dedicated operations teams to configure workflows and maintain data quality — resources most early-stage companies lack.Why Y Combinator startups are rejecting Salesforce and starting with AI-native toolsPeiris claims that the current batch of Y Combinator startups — widely viewed as a bellwether for early-stage company behavior — have largely rejected both Salesforce and HubSpot. \"If you were to poll a random sampling of current YC startups and ask whether they&#x27;re using Salesforce or HubSpot, the overwhelming answer would be &#x27;no,&#x27;\" he said. \"Salesforce is too expensive, too complex to set up, and frankly doesn&#x27;t do enough to justify the investment for an early-stage company.\"According to Peiris, most startups begin with spreadsheets and eventually graduate to a first CRM — a transition point where Lightfield aims to intercede. \"Increasingly, they&#x27;re choosing Lightfield instead and skipping that intermediate step entirely,\" he said.This represents a familiar pattern in enterprise software disruption: a new generation of companies forming habits around different tools, creating an opening for challengers to establish themselves before businesses grow large enough to face pressure toward industry-standard platforms. The company&#x27;s strategy appears to deliberately target this window, aiming to grow alongside early customers and become embedded in their processes as they scale.Can Salesforce and HubSpot retrofit their legacy systems for AI, or is the architecture too old?Both Salesforce and HubSpot have announced AI features in recent quarters, adding capabilities like conversation intelligence and automated data entry to their existing platforms. The question facing Lightfield is whether established vendors can incorporate similar capabilities—leveraging their existing customer bases and integrations — or whether fundamental architectural differences create a genuine moat.Peiris argues the latter. \"The fundamental difference is in how we store data,\" he said. \"Because we have access to that complete context, the analysis we provide and the work we generate tends to be substantially higher quality than tools built on top of traditional database structures.\"Existing conversation intelligence tools like Gong and Revenue.io, which analyze sales calls and provide coaching insights, already serve similar functions but require Salesforce instances to operate. Peiris said Lightfield&#x27;s advantage comes from unifying the entire data model rather than layering analysis on top of fragmented systems.\"We have a more complete picture of each customer because we integrate company knowledge, communication sync, product analytics, and full CRM detail all in one place,\" he said. \"That unified context means the work being generated in Lightfield—whether it&#x27;s analysis, follow-ups, or insights—tends to be significantly higher quality.\"The privacy and accuracy concerns that come with AI-automated customer interactionsThe architecture creates obvious risks. Storing complete conversation histories raises privacy concerns, and relying on large language models to extract and interpret information introduces the possibility of errors—what AI researchers call hallucinations.Peiris acknowledged both issues directly. On privacy, the company maintains that call recording follows standard practices, with visible notifications that recording is in progress, and that storing sales correspondence mirrors what CRM vendors have done for decades. The company has achieved SOC 2 Type I certification and is pursuing both SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance. \"We don&#x27;t train models on customer data, period,\" Peiris said.On accuracy, he was similarly forthright. \"Of course it happens,\" Peiris said when asked about misinterpretations. \"It&#x27;s impossible to completely eliminate hallucinations when working with large language models.\"The company&#x27;s approach is to require human approval before sending customer communications or updating critical fields — positioning the system as augmentation rather than full automation. \"We&#x27;re building a tool that amplifies human judgment, not one that pretends to replace it entirely,\" Peiris said.This is a more cautious stance than some AI-native software companies have taken, reflecting both technical realism about current model capabilities and potential liability concerns around customer-facing mistakes.How Lightfield plans to consolidate ten different sales tools into one platformLightfield&#x27;s pricing strategy reflects a broader thesis about enterprise software economics. Rather than charging per-seat fees for a point solution, the company is positioning itself as a consolidated platform that can replace multiple specialized tools — sales engagement platforms, conversation intelligence systems, meeting assistants, and the CRM itself.\"The real problem is that running a modern go-to-market function requires cobbling together 10 different independent point solutions,\" Peiris said. \"When you pay for 10 separate seat licenses, you&#x27;re essentially paying 10 different companies to solve the same foundational problems over and over again.\"The company operates primarily through self-service signup rather than enterprise sales teams, which Peiris argues allows for lower pricing while maintaining margins. This is a common playbook among modern SaaS companies but represents a fundamental difference from Salesforce&#x27;s model, which relies heavily on direct sales and customer success teams.Whether this approach can support a sustainable business at scale remains unproven. The company&#x27;s current customer base skews heavily toward early-stage startups—more than 100 Y Combinator companies, according to the company — a segment with limited budgets and high failure rates.But Lightfield is betting it can become the system of record for a cohort of fast-growing companies, eventually creating an installed base comparable to how Salesforce established itself decades ago. The company&#x27;s trajectory will likely depend on whether AI capabilities alone provide sufficient differentiation—or whether incumbents can adapt quickly enough to defend their positions.The real test: whether sales teams will trust AI enough to let it run their businessThe company has outlined several areas for expansion, including an open platform for workflows and webhooks that would allow third-party integrations. Early customers have specifically requested connections with tools like Apollo for prospecting and Slack for team communication — gaps that Postle, the Voker.ai founder, acknowledged but dismissed as temporary.\"The fact that HS and Salesforce have these integrations already isn&#x27;t a moat,\" Postle said. \"HS and Salesforce are going to lose to lightfield because they aren&#x27;t AI native, no matter how much they try to pretend to be.\"Rose highlighted an unusual use case that emerged during Lightfield&#x27;s own development: the company&#x27;s product team used the CRM itself to analyze customer conversations and identify feature requests. \"In this sense, Lightfield more than just a sales database, it&#x27;s a customer intelligence layer,\" Rose said.This suggests potential applications beyond traditional sales workflows, positioning the system as infrastructure for any function that requires understanding customer needs—product development, customer success, even marketing strategy.For now, the company is focused on proving the core value proposition with early-stage companies. But the broader question Lightfield raises extends beyond CRM software specifically: whether AI capabilities have advanced sufficiently to replace structured databases as the foundation of enterprise systems, or whether the current generation of large language models remains too unreliable for business-critical functions.The answer will likely emerge not from technical benchmarks but from customer behavior—whether sales teams actually trust AI-generated insights enough to base decisions on them, and whether the efficiency gains justify the inherent unpredictability of working with systems that approximate rather than calculate.Lightfield is betting that the trade-off has already shifted in favor of approximation, at least for the millions of salespeople who currently view their CRM as an obstacle rather than an asset. Whether that bet proves correct will help define the next generation of enterprise software.",

          "standfirst": "The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) hopes to take advantage of an increased demand for customized models and enterprises seeking more transparency from AI models with its latest release.Ai2 made the latest addition to its Olmo family of large language models available to organizations, continuing to focus on openness and customization. Olmo 3 has a longer context window, more reasoning traces and is better at coding than its previous iteration. This latest version, like the other Olmo releases, is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. Enterprises will have complete transparency into and control over the training data and checkpointing. Ai2 will release three versions of Olmo 3:Olmo 3- Think in both 7B and 32B are considered the flagship reasoning models for advanced researchOlmo 3- Base also in both parameters, which is ideal for programming, comprehension, math and long-context reasoning. Ai2 said this version is “ideal for continued pre-training or fine-tuningOlmo 3-Instruct in 7B that is optimized for instruction following, multi-turn dialogue and tool useThe company said Olmo 3- Think is the “first-ever fully open 32B thinking model that generates explicit reasoning-chain-style content.” Olmo-3 Think also has a long context window of 65,000 tokens, perfect for longer-running agentic projects or reasoning over longer documents. Noah Smith, Ai2’s senior director of NLP research, told VentureBeat in an interview that many of its customers, from regulated enterprises to research institutions, want to use models that give them assurance about what went into the training. “The releases from our friends in the tech world are very cool and super exciting, but there are a lot of people for whom data privacy control over what goes into the model, how the models train and other constraints on how the model can be used as front of mind,” said Smith. Developers can access the models on Hugging Face and the Ai2 Playground. Transparency and customizationSmith said models like Olmo 3, which the company believes any organization using its models has to have control over and mold in the way that best works for them.“We don&#x27;t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions,” Smith said. It&#x27;s a known thing in the world of machine learning that if you try and build a model that solves all the problems, it ends up not being really the best model for any one problem. There aren&#x27;t formal proofs of that, but it&#x27;s a thing that old timers like me have kind of observed.”He added that models with the ability to specialize “are maybe not as flash as getting high scores on math exams” but offer more flexibility for enterprises. Olmo 3 allows enterprises to essentially retrain the model by adding to the data mix it learns from. The idea is that businesses can bring in their proprietary sources to guide the model in answering specific company queries. To help enterprises during this process, Ai2 added checkpoints from every major training phase. Demand for model customization has grown as enterprises that cannot build their own LLMs want to create company-specific or industry-focused models. Startups like Arcee have begun offering enterprise-focused, customizable small models. Models like Olmo 3, Smith said, also give enterprises more confidence in the technology. Since Olmo 3 provides the training data, Smith said enterprises can trust that the model did not ingest anything it shouldn’t have.Ai2 has always claimed to be committed to greater transparency, even launching a tool called OlmoTrace in April that can track a model’s output directly back to the original training data. The company releases open-sourced models and posts its code to repositories like GitHub for anyone to use. Competitors like Google and OpenAI have faced criticism from developers over moves that hid raw reasoning tokens and chose to summarize reasoning, claiming that they now resort to “debugging blind” without transparency. Ai2 pretrained Olmo 3 on the six-trillion-token open source dataset, Dolma 3. The dataset encompasses web data, scientific literature and code. Smith said they optimized Olmo 3 for code, compared to the focus on math for Olmo 2. How it stacks upAi2 claims that the Olmo 3 family of models represents a significant leap for truly open-source models, at least for open-source LLMs developed outside China. The base Olmo 3 model trained “with roughly 2.5x greater compute efficiency as measured by GPU-hours per token,” meaning it consumed less energy during pre-training and costs less.The company said the Olmo 3 models outperformed other open models, such as Marin from Stanford, LLM360’s K2, and Apertus, though Ai2 did not provide figures for the benchmark testing. “Of note, Olmo 3-Think (32B) is the strongest fully open reasoning model, narrowing the gap to the best open-weight models of similar scale, such as the Qwen 3-32B-Thinking series of models across our suite of reasoning benchmarks, all while being trained on 6x fewer tokens,” Ai2 said in a press release. The company added that Olmo 3-Instruct performed better than Qwen 2.5, Gemma 3 and Llama 3.1.",

It&#x27;s a known thing in the world of machine learning that if you try and build a model that solves all the problems, it ends up not being really the best model for any one problem. There aren&#x27;t formal proofs of that, but it&#x27;s a thing that old timers like me have kind of observed.”He added that models with the ability to specialize “are maybe not as flash as getting high scores on math exams” but offer more flexibility for enterprises. Olmo 3 allows enterprises to essentially retrain the model by adding to the data mix it learns from. The idea is that businesses can bring in their proprietary sources to guide the model in answering specific company queries. To help enterprises during this process, Ai2 added checkpoints from every major training phase. Demand for model customization has grown as enterprises that cannot build their own LLMs want to create company-specific or industry-focused models. Startups like Arcee have begun offering enterprise-focused, customizable small models. Models like Olmo 3, Smith said, also give enterprises more confidence in the technology. Since Olmo 3 provides the training data, Smith said enterprises can trust that the model did not ingest anything it shouldn’t have.Ai2 has always claimed to be committed to greater transparency, even launching a tool called OlmoTrace in April that can track a model’s output directly back to the original training data. The company releases open-sourced models and posts its code to repositories like GitHub for anyone to use. Competitors like Google and OpenAI have faced criticism from developers over moves that hid raw reasoning tokens and chose to summarize reasoning, claiming that they now resort to “debugging blind” without transparency. Ai2 pretrained Olmo 3 on the six-trillion-token open source dataset, Dolma 3. The dataset encompasses web data, scientific literature and code. Smith said they optimized Olmo 3 for code, compared to the focus on math for Olmo 2. How it stacks upAi2 claims that the Olmo 3 family of models represents a significant leap for truly open-source models, at least for open-source LLMs developed outside China. The base Olmo 3 model trained “with roughly 2.5x greater compute efficiency as measured by GPU-hours per token,” meaning it consumed less energy during pre-training and costs less.The company said the Olmo 3 models outperformed other open models, such as Marin from Stanford, LLM360’s K2, and Apertus, though Ai2 did not provide figures for the benchmark testing. “Of note, Olmo 3-Think (32B) is the strongest fully open reasoning model, narrowing the gap to the best open-weight models of similar scale, such as the Qwen 3-32B-Thinking series of models across our suite of reasoning benchmarks, all while being trained on 6x fewer tokens,” Ai2 said in a press release. The company added that Olmo 3-Instruct performed better than Qwen 2.5, Gemma 3 and Llama 3.1.",

          "standfirst": "Presented by AudioEye In 2020, a blind customer named Juan Alcazar filed a lawsuit against Fashion Nova, alleging that the company’s website was inaccessible and denied blind customers the same access as everyone else.It was, in many ways, an ordinary web accessibility lawsuit. One of many filed in federal court that year. Most ended the same way: management distraction, a pledge to fix accessibility issues, legal fees and then a five-figure settlement. But this case didn’t settle. Fashion Nova fought it.Five years and more than 200 filings later, they agreed to pay $5.15 million to settle what had become a class action lawsuit. The claim evolved from a single complaint into the second-largest accessibility settlement on record, surpassed only by Target’s $6 million agreement in 2008.It’s a stark reminder of how quickly an accessibility claim can escalate, and why every business leader should treat that risk as real, urgent, and solvable.Accessibility lawsuits are increasing. So is risk.Since 2020, the number of web accessibility lawsuits has steadily risen. In 2024, over 4,000 lawsuits were filed in the United States. And those are just the cases that reach court. Behind the scenes, demand letters are even more prevalent, with multiple sources, including Accessibility.com, estimating that over 250,000 letters are sent to businesses annually.Often, these suits hinge on common accessibility issues, such as missing alt text or unlabeled forms. Under laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, plaintiffs don’t need to prove intent or significant harm. Simply encountering a barrier is enough.Accessibility compliance isn’t just a U.S. issue, either. The European Accessibility Act (EAA) took effect in July 2025, expanding accessibility obligations to any business offering digital products or services in the EU, including companies located outside the EU, impacting global brands.And while many assume that only large companies are subject to legal risk, in 2024, nearly three-quarters of web accessibility lawsuits targeted small and mid-sized businesses.For billion-dollar brands like Fashion Nova, there’s always the option to dig in and fight an accessibility claim. However, for smaller businesses, the risk of a protracted legal battle and a substantial settlement can be too high. Settling quickly is often perceived as the ‘safe’ choice — a fact that firms that specialize in serial litigation are all too aware of.Make accessibility a first line of defenseAccessibility lawsuits have a pattern: once a company is sued, it’s much more likely to be sued again. Accessibility.com also reports that in 2024, 48% of defendants had previously been sued for web accessibility barriers.That’s why smart risk management isn’t just about having a plan to respond. It’s about lowering the chances of being on someone’s radar in the first place. And that starts with a process for finding and fixing accessibility issues before they’re brought to attention in a demand letter or legal claim:Establish a baseline of website accessibility by using automated scans in conjunction with human reviews.Prioritize high-severity barriers, or those most likely to spark a claim, and address them promptly.Continuously monitor websites to find and fix issues before they become liabilities.Document progress to prove ongoing improvement if questioned.Integrate accessibility into everyday workflows, making accessibility part of organizational culture.A scalable approach to accessibility complianceAudioEye’s 2025 Digital Accessibility Index analyzed over 15,000 websites across different industries. The average site had 297 accessibility issues per page — including serious problems like unlabeled buttons or broken form fields.Fixing a few accessibility issues might sound manageable. But when there are dozens of web pages, each with hundreds of unique issues, it quickly becomes an operational nightmare.The biggest challenge is serving customers while addressing countless accessibility issues. Relying on developers to find and fix hundreds of issues per page is challenging enough. Still, teams also have to contend with the fact that each site update presents a chance to introduce new barriers inadvertently. Automation helps, but no automated tool can find and fix everything (no matter what some accessibility companies claim in their marketing campaigns).The most effective approach blends automation and human expertise to:Scale detection and prevention: Let automation do the heavy lifting, scanning sites in real time and fixing new issues as they appear.Tackle complex fixes: Rely on experts to test key pages and fix the high-risk issues that automation can’t handle on its own.With these pieces in place, organizations can prevent serious accessibility issues from accumulating, while making sites much safer from legal claims. That’s risk management in action: not scrambling after the fact, but planning ahead with the right tools, expertise, and processes in place.The cost of doing nothingEven the smallest web accessibility claim can disrupt businesses. Settlements may range from a few thousand dollars to six figures. Still, the actual cost extends beyond this: legal fees, time spent resolving issues, and executive focus being diverted from other priorities.And then there’s the bigger risk: escalation. Alcazar v. Fashion Nova, Inc. won’t be the last large accessibility settlement. However, it serves as a clear reminder of what can happen when an accessibility claim snowballs into something much larger.The companies that manage risk best aren’t perfect. But they know where they stand. They can show progress. And when a claim comes in, they know how to respond.Accessibility may not feel like a risk today. But if organizations wait until it does, it’s already too late.Treat it like what it is: a business risk worth managing — before it becomes a business risk that can’t be ignored.David Moradi is CEO of Audioeye.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has introduced GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, a new frontier agentic coding model now available in its Codex developer environment. The release marks a significant step forward in AI-assisted software engineering, offering improved long-horizon reasoning, efficiency, and real-time interactive capabilities. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will now replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model across Codex-integrated surfaces.The new model is designed to serve as a persistent, high-context software development agent, capable of managing complex refactors, debugging workflows, and project-scale tasks across multiple context windows.It comes on the heels of Google releasing its powerful new Gemini 3 Pro model yesterday, yet still outperforms or matches it on key coding benchmarks: On SWE-Bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieved 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, edging past Gemini 3 Pro’s 76.2%. It also led on Terminal-Bench 2.0, with 58.1% accuracy versus Gemini’s 54.2%, and matched Gemini’s score of 2,439 on LiveCodeBench Pro, a competitive coding Elo benchmark.When measured against Gemini 3 Pro’s most advanced configuration — its Deep Thinking model — Codex-Max holds a slight edge in agentic coding benchmarks, as well. Performance Benchmarks: Incremental Gains Across Key TasksGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max demonstrates measurable improvements over GPT‑5.1-Codex across a range of standard software engineering benchmarks. On SWE-Lancer IC SWE, it achieved 79.9% accuracy, a significant increase from GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 66.3%. In SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), it reached 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, outperforming GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 73.7%.Performance on Terminal Bench 2.0 (n=89) showed more modest improvements, with GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieving 58.1% accuracy compared to 52.8% for GPT‑5.1-Codex. All evaluations were run with compaction and extra-high reasoning effort enabled.These results indicate that the new model offers a higher ceiling on both benchmarked correctness and real-world usability under extended reasoning loads.Technical Architecture: Long-Horizon Reasoning via CompactionA major architectural improvement in GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is its ability to reason effectively over extended input-output sessions using a mechanism called compaction. This enables the model to retain key contextual information while discarding irrelevant details as it nears its context window limit — effectively allowing for continuous work across millions of tokens without performance degradation.The model has been internally observed to complete tasks lasting more than 24 hours, including multi-step refactors, test-driven iteration, and autonomous debugging.Compaction also improves token efficiency. At medium reasoning effort, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max used approximately 30% fewer thinking tokens than GPT‑5.1-Codex for comparable or better accuracy, which has implications for both cost and latency.Platform Integration and Use CasesGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is currently available across multiple Codex-based environments, which refer to OpenAI’s own integrated tools and interfaces built specifically for code-focused AI agents. These include:Codex CLI, OpenAI’s official command-line tool (@openai/codex), where GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is already live.IDE extensions, likely developed or maintained by OpenAI, though no specific third-party IDE integrations were named.Interactive coding environments, such as those used to demonstrate frontend simulation apps like CartPole or Snell’s Law Explorer.Internal code review tooling, used by OpenAI’s engineering teams.For now, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is not yet available via public API, though OpenAI states this is coming soon. Users who wish to work with the model in terminal environments today can do so by installing and using the Codex CLI.It is not currently confirmed whether or how the model will integrate into third-party IDEs unless they are built on top of the CLI or future API.The model is capable of interacting with live tools and simulations. Examples shown in the release include:An interactive CartPole policy gradient simulator, which visualizes reinforcement learning training and activations.A Snell’s Law optics explorer, supporting dynamic ray tracing across refractive indices.These interfaces exemplify the model’s ability to reason in real time while maintaining an interactive development session — effectively bridging computation, visualization, and implementation within a single loop.Cybersecurity and Safety ConstraintsWhile GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not meet OpenAI’s “High” capability threshold for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework, it is currently the most capable cybersecurity model OpenAI has deployed. It supports use cases such as automated vulnerability detection and remediation, but with strict sandboxing and disabled network access by default.OpenAI reports no increase in scaled malicious use but has introduced enhanced monitoring systems, including activity routing and disruption mechanisms for suspicious behavior. Codex remains isolated to a local workspace unless developers opt-in to broader access, mitigating risks like prompt injection from untrusted content.Deployment Context and Developer UsageGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is currently available to users on ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. It will also become the new default in Codex-based environments, replacing GPT‑5.1-Codex, which was a more general-purpose model.OpenAI states that 95% of its internal engineers use Codex weekly, and since adoption, these engineers have shipped ~70% more pull requests on average — highlighting the tool’s impact on internal development velocity.Despite its autonomy and persistence, OpenAI stresses that Codex-Max should be treated as a coding assistant, not a replacement for human review. The model produces terminal logs, test citations, and tool call outputs to support transparency in generated code.OutlookGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max represents a significant evolution in OpenAI’s strategy toward agentic development tools, offering greater reasoning depth, token efficiency, and interactive capabilities across software engineering tasks. By extending its context management and compaction strategies, the model is positioned to handle tasks at the scale of full repositories, rather than individual files or snippets.With continued emphasis on agentic workflows, secure sandboxes, and real-world evaluation metrics, Codex-Max sets the stage for the next generation of AI-assisted programming environments — while underscoring the importance of oversight in increasingly autonomous systems.",

Nano Banana Pro is part of the newly launched Gemini 3 Pro—it’s actually called Gemini 3 Pro Image in the same way the original is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, but Google is sticking with the meme-y name. You can access it by selecting Gemini 3 Pro and then turning on the “Create images” option. Nano Banana Pro: Your new creative partner. Google says the new model can follow complex prompts to create more accurate images. The model is apparently so capable that it can generate an entire usable infographic in a single shot with no weird AI squiggles in place of words. Nano Banana Pro is also better at maintaining consistency in images. You can blend up to 14 images with this tool, and it can maintain the appearance of up to five people in outputs.Read full article Comments",

Today, Google is announcing another small step forward in interoperability, pointing to a slightly less annoying future for friend groups or households where not everyone owns an iPhone. Google has updated Android’s Quick Share feature to support Apple’s AirDrop, which allows users of Apple devices to share files directly using a local peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection. Apple devices with AirDrop enabled and set to “everyone for 10 minutes” mode will show up in the Quick Share device list just like another Android phone would, and Android devices that support this new Quick Share version will also show up in the AirDrop menu. Google will only support this feature on the Pixel 10 series, at least to start. The company is “looking forward to improving the experience and expanding it to more Android devices,” but it didn’t announce anything about a timeline or any hardware or software requirements. Quick Share also won’t work with AirDrop devices working in the default “contacts only” mode, though Google “[welcomes] the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future.” (Reading between the lines: Google and Apple are not currently working together to enable this, and Google confirmed to The Verge that Apple hadn’t been involved in this at all.)Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Astronomical events such as eclipses were central to Maya culture, reflected in the care the Maya took to keep accurate calendars to aid in celestial predictions. Among the few surviving Maya texts is the so-called Dresden Codex, which includes a table of eclipses. Researchers have concluded that this table was repurposed from earlier lunar month tables, rather than being created solely for eclipse prediction, according to a paper published in the journal Science Advances. They also figured out the mechanism by which the Maya ensured that table would be accurate over a very long time period. The Maya used three primary calendars: a count of days, known as the Long Count; a 260-day astrological calendar called the Tzolk’in; and a 356-day year called the Haab’. Previous scholars have speculated on how awe-inspiring solar or lunar eclipses must have seemed to the Maya, but our understanding of their astronomical knowledge is limited. Most Maya books were burned by Spanish conquistadors and Catholic priests. Only four hieroglyphic codices survive: the Dresden Codex, the Madrid Codex, the Paris Codex, and the Grolier Codex. The Dresden Codex dates back to the 11th or 12th century and likely originated near Chichen Itza. It can be folded accordion-style and is 12 feet long in its unfolded state. The text was deciphered in the early 20th century and describes local history as well as astronomical lunar and Venus tables.Read full article Comments",

Google has teamed up with Nvidia to offer a version of GeForce Now cloud streaming that is perplexingly limited in some ways and generous in others. Starting today, anyone who buys a Chromebook will get a free year of a new service called GeForce Now Fast Pass. There are no ads and less waiting for server slots, but you don’t get to play very long. Back before Google killed its Stadia game streaming service, it would often throw in a few months of the Pro subscription with Chromebook purchases. In the absence of its own gaming platform, Google has turned to Nvidia to level up Chromebook gaming. GeForce Now (GFN), which has been around in one form or another for more than a decade, allows you to render games on a remote server and stream the video output to the device of your choice. It works on computers, phones, TVs, and yes, Chromebooks. The new Chromebook feature is not the same GeForce Now subscription you can get from Nvidia. Fast Pass, which is exclusive to Chromebooks, includes a mishmash of limits and bonuses that make it a pretty strange offering. Fast Pass is based on the free tier of GeForce Now, but users will get priority access to server slots. So no queuing for five or 10 minutes to start playing. It also lacks the ads that Nvidia’s standard free tier includes. Fast Pass also uses the more powerful RTX servers, which are otherwise limited to the $10-per-month ($100 yearly) Performance tier.Read full article Comments",

In the aftermath of the disaster, whale scientist Iain Kerr traveled to the area to study how the spill had affected sperm whales, aiming specialized darts at the animals to collect pencil eraser-sized tissue samples. It wasn’t going well. Each time his boat approached a whale surfacing for air, the animal vanished beneath the waves before he could reach it. “I felt like I was playing Whac-A-Mole,” he says. As darkness fell, a whale dove in front of Kerr and covered him in whale snot. That unpleasant experience gave Kerr, who works at the conservation group Ocean Alliance, an idea: What if he could collect that same snot by somehow flying over the whale? Researchers can glean much information from whale snot, including the animal’s DNA sequence, its sex, whether it is pregnant, and the makeup of its microbiome.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Not everyone appreciates the artistry of Jackson Pollock’s famous drip paintings, with some dismissing them as something any child could create. While Pollock’s work is undeniably more sophisticated than that, it turns out that when one looks at splatter paintings made by adults and young children through a fractal lens and compares them to those of Pollock himself, the children’s work does bear a closer resemblance to Pollock’s than those of the adults. This might be due to the artist’s physiology, namely a certain clumsiness with regard to balance, according to a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Physics. Co-author Richard Taylor, a physicist at the University of Oregon, first found evidence of fractal patterns in Pollock’s seemingly random drip patterns in 2001. As previously reported, his original hypothesis drew considerable controversy, both from art historians and a few fellow physicists. In a 2006 paper published in Nature, Case University physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur claimed Taylor’s work was “seriously flawed” and “lacked the range of scales needed to be considered fractal.” (To prove the point, Jones-Smith created her own version of a fractal painting using Taylor’s criteria in about five minutes with Photoshop.) Taylor was particularly criticized for his attempt to use fractal analysis as the basis for an authentication tool to distinguish genuine Pollocks from reproductions or forgeries. He concedes that much of that criticism was valid at the time. But as vindication, he points to a machine learning-based study in 2015 relying on fractal dimension and other factors that achieved a 93 percent accuracy rate distinguishing between genuine Pollocks and non-Pollocks. Taylor built on that work for a 2024 paper reporting 99 percent accuracy.Read full article Comments",

The military later changed the prefix for pursuit aircraft to F for fighter, leading to recognizable modern names like the F-15 and F-16. Now, the newest branch of the military is carving its own path with a new document outlining how the Space Force, which can trace its lineage back to the Army Air Service, will name and designate its “weapon systems” on the ground and in orbit.

          "content": "On September 19, 1982, Carnegie Mellon University computer science research assistant professor Scott Fahlman posted a message to the university’s bulletin board software that would later come to shape how people communicate online. His proposal: use :-) and :-( as markers to distinguish jokes from serious comments. While Fahlman describes himself as “the inventor… or at least one of the inventors” of what would later be called the smiley face emoticon, the full story reveals something more interesting than a lone genius moment. The whole episode started three days earlier when computer scientist Neil Swartz posed a physics problem to colleagues on Carnegie Mellon’s “bboard,” which was an early online message board. The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment. Despite clarifying posts noting the warning was a joke, some people took it seriously.Read full article Comments",

But the object’s closest approach to the Sun came in late October during the US government shutdown. So, while enough people went to work to ensure that the hardware continued to do its job, nobody was available at NASA to make the images available to the public or discuss their implications. So today, NASA held a press conference to discuss everything that we now know about 3I/ATLAS and how NASA’s hardware contributed to that knowledge. And to say one more time that the object is a fairly typical comet and not some spaceship doing its best to appear like one. Extrasolar comet 3I/ATLAS is an extrasolar comet and the third visitor from another star that we’ve detected. We know the comet part because it looks like one, forming a coma of gas and dust, as well as a tail as the Sun heats up its materials. That hasn’t stopped the usual suspect (Avi Loeb) from speculating that it might be a spacecraft, as he had for the earlier visitors. NASA doesn’t want to hear it. “This object is a comet,” said Associate Administrator Amit Kshatrya. “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”Read full article Comments",

This caused trouble for software that needs to read the file to maintain the Cloudflare bot management system that uses a machine learning model to protect against security threats.
