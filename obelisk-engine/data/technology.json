          "content": "Earlier this year, Google announced the end of its efforts to get Steam running on Chromebooks, but it’s not done trying to make these low-power laptops into gaming machines. Google has teamed up with Nvidia to offer a version of GeForce Now cloud streaming that is perplexingly limited in some ways and generous in others. Starting today, anyone who buys a Chromebook will get a free year of a new service called GeForce Now Fast Pass. There are no ads and less waiting for server slots, but you don’t get to play very long. Back before Google killed its Stadia game streaming service, it would often throw in a few months of the Pro subscription with Chromebook purchases. In the absence of its own gaming platform, Google has turned to Nvidia to level up Chromebook gaming. GeForce Now (GFN), which has been around in one form or another for more than a decade, allows you to render games on a remote server and stream the video output to the device of your choice. It works on computers, phones, TVs, and yes, Chromebooks. The new Chromebook feature is not the same GeForce Now subscription you can get from Nvidia. Fast Pass, which is exclusive to Chromebooks, includes a mishmash of limits and bonuses that make it a pretty strange offering. Fast Pass is based on the free tier of GeForce Now, but users will get priority access to server slots. So no queuing for five or 10 minutes to start playing. It also lacks the ads that Nvidia’s standard free tier includes. Fast Pass also uses the more powerful RTX servers, which are otherwise limited to the $10-per-month ($100 yearly) Performance tier.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Nvidia has partnered with Google to launch a new cloud gaming plan exclusive to Chromebooks. GeForce Now Fast Pass will allow Chromebook owners to stream over 2,000 games directly from an existing PC game library without ads, and new Chromebook purchases will include a year’s membership for free. Fast Pass looks similar to GeForce Now’s existing free plan, which includes the ability to stream more than 2,000 “Ready-to-Play” titles from a user’s existing Steam, Epic, or Xbox libraries. Unlike that plan, the companies say Fast Pass “has no ads,” and “allows you to skip the queue,” compared to typical waits of two minutes or more to start playing on the free plan. There are other restrictions, with Fast Pass users limited to 10 hours of cloud gaming each month. Up to five of those can roll over to the next month if you don’t use them up though. Nvidia’s other paid plans, which start at $9.99 per month, support a variety of other features, including higher resolutions, faster frame rates, RTX ray-tracing, and access to a larger game library bolstered by a couple of thousand “Install-to-Play” titles that must be installed onto Nvidia’s servers before you can access them. Google says that anyone who purchases a new Chromebook will now get one year of GeForce Now Fast Pass included. The companies haven’t confirmed how much Fast Pass will cost outside of that offer.",

We’re big fans of the brand’s charging gear and accessories — Anker has earned kudos in a number of our buying guides, from power banks to wireless chargers. Now for Black Friday, a whole slew of the company’s gear is on sale, and some are hitting the best prices we’ve seen this year. So if you’re looking for dependable sidekicks and the supporting players that keep your heavy hitters in business, check out the best Anker Black Friday deals we could find. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and let you play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to the wall. Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "Some people shop Black Friday sales for discounts on shoes and socket wrenches, duvet covers and blow up mattresses — none of those things are on this list. Here you’ll find only the best electronics for less than $50 a pop. These are all gadgets and accessories we’ve tested for our buying guides, recommended in our gift guides or reviewed for, well, our reviews. For less than $50, you can pick up Engadget-approved gear like earbuds, smart speakers, streaming sticks, power banks, smart plugs, Bluetooth trackers and more. So if you need accessories to support your bigger devices, or want a few clever gadgets to smarten up your space, check out the best Black Friday tech deals for under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $2 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. It’s 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $20 ($7 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-live-apple-airtags-legos-blink-cameras-ugreen-chargers-and-more-173833363.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Some people shop Black Friday sales for discounts on shoes and socket wrenches, duvet covers and blow up mattresses — none of those things are on this list. Here you’ll find only the best electronics for less than $50 a pop. These are all gadgets and accessories we’ve tested for our buying guides, recommended in our gift guides or reviewed for, well, our reviews. For less than $50, you can pick up Engadget-approved gear like earbuds, smart speakers, streaming sticks, power banks, smart plugs, Bluetooth trackers and more. So if you need accessories to support your bigger devices, or want a few clever gadgets to smarten up your space, check out the best Black Friday tech deals for under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $2 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. It’s 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $20 ($7 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it.

Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out.

Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart.

This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $420 (50 percent off): Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-deals-2025-early-sales-on-fubo-rosetta-stone-headspace-and-more-180000874.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’re looking to grab a new SSD for a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget, Black Friday is typically a good time to take the plunge. To help you separate the fake discounts from the stuff worth your time, we’ve picked through the many sales going on now and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could find below. So far we’re seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth calling out. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off MSRP): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. If you want more space, the 512GB version of the Play Pro is also on sale for $99. That’s not an all-time low, but it’s about $15 off that card’s average street price in recent months and as cheap as any other 512GB microSD Express model we can find in stock right now. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Likewise, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Amazon ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. White this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-and-other-storage-devices-we-can-find-175429637.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Apple's AirPods 4 have dropped back down to a record low price in an Amazon Black Friday deal. If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 34 percent off, bringing it down to just $85 from its usual price of $130. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. Elsewhere when it comes to Black Friday AirPods deals, you can pick up the AirPods 4 with ANC for only $110, and the new AirPods Pro 3 for $220.

          "content": "Apple's AirPods 4 have dropped back down to a record low price in an Amazon Black Friday deal. If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 34 percent off, bringing it down to just $85 from its usual price of $130. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears.

          "title": "ScaleOps' new AI Infra Product slashes GPU costs for self-hosted enterprise LLMs by 50% for early adopters",
          "standfirst": "ScaleOps has expanded its cloud resource management platform with a new product aimed at enterprises operating self-hosted large language models (LLMs) and GPU-based AI applications. The AI Infra Product announced today, extends the company’s existing automation capabilities to address a growing need for efficient GPU utilization, predictable performance, and reduced operational burden in large-scale AI deployments. The company said the system is already running in enterprise production environments and delivering major efficiency gains for early adopters, reducing GPU costs by between 50% and 70%, according to the company. The company does not publicly list enterprise pricing for this solution and instead invites interested customers to receive a custom quote based on their operation size and needs here.In explaining how the system behaves under heavy load, Yodar Shafrir, CEO and Co-Founder of ScaleOps, said in an email to VentureBeat that the platform uses “proactive and reactive mechanisms to handle sudden spikes without performance impact,” noting that its workload rightsizing policies “automatically manage capacity to keep resources available.” He added that minimizing GPU cold-start delays was a priority, emphasizing that the system “ensures instant response when traffic surges,” particularly for AI workloads where model load times are substantial.Expanding Resource Automation to AI InfrastructureEnterprises deploying self-hosted AI models face performance variability, long load times, and persistent underutilization of GPU resources. ScaleOps positioned the new AI Infra Product as a direct response to these issues. The platform allocates and scales GPU resources in real time and adapts to changes in traffic demand without requiring alterations to existing model deployment pipelines or application code.According to ScaleOps, the system manages production environments for organizations including Wiz, DocuSign, Rubrik, Coupa, Alkami, Vantor, Grubhub, Island, Chewy, and several Fortune 500 companies. The AI Infra Product introduces workload-aware scaling policies that proactively and reactively adjust capacity to maintain performance during demand spikes. The company stated that these policies reduce the cold-start delays associated with loading large AI models, which improves responsiveness when traffic increases.Technical Integration and Platform CompatibilityThe product is designed for compatibility with common enterprise infrastructure patterns. It works across all Kubernetes distributions, major cloud platforms, on-premises data centers, and air-gapped environments. ScaleOps emphasized that deployment does not require code changes, infrastructure rewrites, or modifications to existing manifests. Shafrir said the platform “integrates seamlessly into existing model deployment pipelines without requiring any code or infrastructure changes,” and he added that teams can begin optimizing immediately with their existing GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment tooling.Shafrir also addressed how the automation interacts with existing systems. He said the platform operates without disrupting workflows or creating conflicts with custom scheduling or scaling logic, explaining that the system “doesn’t change manifests or deployment logic” and instead enhances schedulers, autoscalers, and custom policies by incorporating real-time operational context while respecting existing configuration boundaries.Performance, Visibility, and User ControlThe platform provides full visibility into GPU utilization, model behavior, performance metrics, and scaling decisions at multiple levels, including pods, workloads, nodes, and clusters. While the system applies default workload scaling policies, ScaleOps noted that engineering teams retain the ability to tune these policies as needed.In practice, the company aims to reduce or eliminate the manual tuning that DevOps and AIOps teams typically perform to manage AI workloads. Installation is intended to require minimal effort, described by ScaleOps as a two-minute process using a single helm flag, after which optimization can be enabled through a single action.Cost Savings and Enterprise Case StudiesScaleOps reported that early deployments of the AI Infra Product have achieved GPU cost reductions of 50–70% in customer environments. The company cited two examples:A major creative software company operating thousands of GPUs averaged 20% utilization before adopting ScaleOps. The product increased utilization, consolidated underused capacity, and enabled GPU nodes to scale down. These changes reduced overall GPU spending by more than half. The company also reported a 35% reduction in latency for key workloads.A global gaming company used the platform to optimize a dynamic LLM workload running on hundreds of GPUs. According to ScaleOps, the product increased utilization by a factor of seven while maintaining service-level performance. The customer projected $1.4 million in annual savings from this workload alone.ScaleOps stated that the expected GPU savings typically outweigh the cost of adopting and operating the platform, and that customers with limited infrastructure budgets have reported fast returns on investment.Industry Context and Company PerspectiveThe rapid adoption of self-hosted AI models has created new operational challenges for enterprises, particularly around GPU efficiency and the complexity of managing large-scale workloads. Shafrir described the broader landscape as one in which “cloud-native AI infrastructure is reaching a breaking point.”“Cloud-native architectures unlocked great flexibility and control, but they also introduced a new level of complexity,” he said in the announcement. “Managing GPU resources at scale has become chaotic—waste, performance issues, and skyrocketing costs are now the norm. The ScaleOps platform was built to fix this. It delivers the complete solution for managing and optimizing GPU resources in cloud-native environments, enabling enterprises to run LLMs and AI applications efficiently, cost-effectively, and while improving performance.”Shafrir added that the product brings together the full set of cloud resource management functions needed to manage diverse workloads at scale. The company positioned the platform as a holistic system for continuous, automated optimization.A Unified Approach for the FutureWith the addition of the AI Infra Product, ScaleOps aims to establish a unified approach to GPU and AI workload management that integrates with existing enterprise infrastructure. The platform’s early performance metrics and reported cost savings suggest a focus on measurable efficiency improvements within the expanding ecosystem of self-hosted AI deployments.",

          "standfirst": "Google is gradually replacing the outgoing Assistant with Gemini in all of its apps, and now it’s the turn of Android Auto. In the next few months, any Android users who have made the jump to Gemini on their phones will be able to interact with the next-generation AI assistant while driving using natural language. The Gemini-ification of Google Maps has already happened, and its new features are also coming to Android Auto. You can do things like ask the AI about restaurants that serve a specific cuisine on your current route, and ask follow-up questions about the menu or its proximity to your destination. From there, Maps can guide you to the restaurant. Gemini lets you ask questions as you would when talking to another human, which theoretically means you can focus more on the road and less on how to construct a prompt that it will understand. The same applies to sending messages while driving. Where before, you’d have to say exactly what you wanted to write. You can just give the AI the gist and it will use the relevant information, such as your ETA if you’re meeting someone, and it can add extra details if requested without you needing to restart the message from scratch. Gemini will also summarize grouped messages. Gemini can also access your Gmail account and pick out things like hotel addresses, as well as running you through your unread emails. Other apps you might want to use while driving, such as Calendar, can also be accessed by the more conversational Gemini. Gemini doubles as a DJ of sorts too, and is able to create on-the-fly playlists with specific conditions relating to genre, length or your general mood. You can even ask it to choose songs that fit the current weather outside. It can also act as a tour guide, running you through some facts about a destination, and if you’re on the way to the wedding, Google even suggests practicing your speech in the car. Gemini likely won’t judge you for calling on its services for some last-minute speech-writing either. As long as you have the Gemini app on your phone, it should start appearing on your Android Auto-enabled infotainment system. You can either say “Hey Google”, tap the on-screen mic button or press the voice control button on the steering wheel. 45 languages are supported and you can translate any message into a language that Gemini knows in real-time.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-arrives-on-android-auto-170012688.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you'd rather not spend the money on a brand new TV this year, you can make an old set feel new again with a streaming device. Our favorite streaming device is on sale right now for Black Friday: you can grab the Google TV Streamer 4K for only $75, which is the lowest price we've seen so far. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $85 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is a banner time to pick up some of the latest gear from Apple for a discount. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for, oh, 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3, a bunch of MacBooks and, of course, all models of the iPhone 17 lineup. Speaking of which, you won’t see iPhone deals represented here — service and contract-related discounts tend to make those savings a little too specific. But if you want to save on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, accessories or other Apple gear, look no further. These are the best Black Friday Apple deals we could find. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $110 ($69 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $129 ($12 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. They've gone as low as $89 recently. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Best Buy: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Walmart and Amazon are selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $923 ($76 off) at Walmart: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $50 discount matches the lowest price we've seen. Also at B&H. It's $29 more at Amazon. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple MagSafe cable 25W for $23 ($17 off) at Best Buy: Apple leads the way in fast wireless charging, typically debuting faster wattage technology before other companies. The iPhone 17 can wirelessly recharge at 25-watt speeds with pads like this (or other Qi2 25W chargers). You can also get those speeds with iPhone 16 handsets that have updated to the latest OS 26 version. Just note that you’ll need to plug it into at least a 30 watt adapter, which isn’t included. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-apple-black-friday-deals-on-ipads-airpods-macbooks-apple-watches-and-airtags-are-already-up-to-39-percent-off-161346405.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Black Friday is a banner time to pick up some of the latest gear from Apple for a discount. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for, oh, 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3, a bunch of MacBooks and, of course, all models of the iPhone 17 lineup. Speaking of which, you won’t see iPhone deals represented here — service and contract-related discounts tend to make those savings a little too specific. But if you want to save on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, accessories or other Apple gear, look no further. These are the best Black Friday Apple deals we could find. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $110 ($69 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $129 ($12 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. They've gone as low as $89 recently. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Best Buy: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Walmart and Amazon are selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $923 ($76 off) at Walmart: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $50 discount matches the lowest price we've seen. Also at B&H. It's $29 more at Amazon. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside.

This model topped our list of the best action cameras, and for good reason. It's a fantastic device with all kinds of bells and whistles. It's the most versatile Hero camera that GoPro has ever made. There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved. There's no internal storage here, but it accepts microSD cards. There's a camera bundle on sale right now that includes a 64GB microSD, three batteries, a dual charger and a case.

It's a heck of a deal, given that the original asking price is nearly $200. There's just one caveat. The price is only for Amazon Prime members. The DJI Neo was recently pushed off our list of the best drones in favor of the newer Neo 2, but the original is still a fantastic, budget-friendly option. We called it the \"best $200 drone ever made\" in our official review, and with good reason. It's quick, ultra-maneuverable and beginner-friendly. The learning curve here isn't that steep. It boasts four propeller guards, for safety, and the built-in 4K camera certainly gets the job done. It's extremely light, weighing just 135 grams. This makes it easy to transport, sure, but also means that the Neo is exempt from drone license requirements. This version doesn't ship with a dedicated controller, though there is a combo pack for that, but that doesn't really matter here.

Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board starting November 21, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. Also starting November 21, the DualSense Wireless Controller will be down to $60, a $20 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $170 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $180.

This year likely more so than ever thanks to the launch of the Switch 2 back in the spring. But fi you were hoping to save money on the console with Black Friday deals, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Black Friday deals are few and far between. However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones. Joy-Con 2 bundle Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Camera Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Hori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera Amazon Best Buy Joy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

          "standfirst": "While there are lots of great Black Friday sales on cheaper devices, it's the big ticket items that really make a world of difference. Take Apple's 2024 Mac mini M4, which has dropped to $479 from $599 as part of early Black Friday deals. The 20 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $10 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $719, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $889, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $280 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles starting November 21. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. More Black Friday tech deals Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $280 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles starting November 21. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. More Black Friday tech deals Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

          "standfirst": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s OK to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales already floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. If you're already happy with your TV, we've also included a few deals on media streamers we like. The current selection includes several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense, but we’ll update this post through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143676.html?src=rss",

The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143676.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Sling TV is one of the best live streaming streaming services out there right now, giving you the option to watch a number of traditional cable channels without the traditional, locked-in price of a cable subscription. For Black Friday, you can save on Sling TV's newly announced $5 Day Passes. That $5 price is the regular cost — for a limited time through November 30, a Day Pass for Sling Orange is only $1 and that includes access to 34 channels like ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3. Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV.

          "standfirst": "Amazon Black Friday deals almost always include discounts on Fire TV devices and Fire TV sets. This year is no different, and some of the best discounts bring Fire TV streaming dongles down to near record-low prices. Case in point: the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 41 percent off and down to only $35. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget's favorite streaming devices. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you'll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers. The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon's Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on Samsung's The Frame) while the device is in standby. It's also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and works well as a retro game emulator, too. The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device's low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff. Also on sale is Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, our pick for the best budget streaming stick. This model doesn't support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it's certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.

          "title": "Tome's founders ditch viral presentation app with 20M users to build AI-native CRM Lightfield",
          "standfirst": "Lightfield, a customer relationship management platform built entirely around artificial intelligence, officially launched to the public this week after a year of quiet development — a bold pivot by a startup that once had 20 million users and $43 million in the bank building something completely different.The San Francisco-based company is positioning itself as a fundamental reimagining of how businesses track and manage customer relationships, abandoning the manual data entry that has defined CRMs for decades in favor of a system that automatically captures, organizes, and acts on customer interactions. With more than 100 early customers already using the platform daily — over half spending more than an hour per day in the system — Lightfield is a direct challenge to the legacy business models of Salesforce and HubSpot, both of which generate billions in annual revenue.\"The CRM, categorically, is perhaps the most complex and lowest satisfaction piece of software on Earth,\" said Keith Peiris, Lightfield&#x27;s co-founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"CRM companies have tens of millions of users, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a single one who actually loves the product. That problem is our opportunity.\"The general availability announcement marks an unusual inflection point in enterprise software: a company betting that large language models have advanced enough to replace structured databases as the foundation of business-critical systems. It&#x27;s a wager that has attracted backing from Coatue Management, which led the company&#x27;s Series A when it was still building presentation software under the name Tome.How Tome&#x27;s founders abandoned 20 million users to build a CRM from scratchThe story behind Lightfield&#x27;s creation reflects both conviction and pragmatism. Tome had achieved significant viral success as an AI-powered presentation platform, gaining millions of users who appreciated its visual design and ease of use. But Peiris said the team concluded that building lasting differentiation in the general-purpose presentation market would prove difficult, even with a working product and real user traction.\"Tome went viral as an AI slides product, and it was visually delightful and easy to use—the first real generative AI-based presentation platform,\" Peiris explained. \"But, the more people used it, the more I realized that to really help people communicate something—anything—we needed more context.\"That realization led to a fundamental rethinking. The team observed that the most effective communication requires deep understanding of relationships, company dynamics, and ongoing conversations — context that exists most richly in sales and customer-facing roles. Rather than building a horizontal tool for everyone, they decided to build vertically for go-to-market teams.\"We chose this lane, &#x27;sales,&#x27; because so many people in these roles used Tome, and it seemed like the most logical place to go vertical,\" Peiris said. The team reduced headcount to a core group of engineers and spent a year building in stealth.Dan Rose, a senior advisor at Coatue who led the original investment in Tome, said the pivot validated his conviction in the founding team. \"It takes real guts to pivot, and even more so when the original product is working,\" Rose said. \"They shrunk the team down to a core group of engineers and got to work building Lightfield. This was not an easy product to build, it is extremely complex under the hood.\"Why Lightfield stores complete conversations instead of forcing data into fieldsWhat distinguishes Lightfield from traditional CRMs is architectural, not cosmetic. While Salesforce, HubSpot, and their competitors require users to define rigid data schemas upfront — dropdown menus, custom fields, checkbox categories — and then manually populate those fields after every interaction, Lightfield stores the complete, unstructured record of what customers actually say and do.\"Traditional CRMs force every interaction through predefined fields — they&#x27;re compressing rich, nuanced customer conversations into structured database entries,\" Peiris said. \"We store customer data in its raw, lossless form. That means we&#x27;re capturing significantly more detail and context than a traditional CRM ever could.\"In practice, this means the system automatically records and transcribes sales calls, ingests emails, monitors product usage, and maintains what the company calls a \"relationship timeline\" — a complete chronological record of every touchpoint between a company and its customers. AI models then extract structured information from this raw data on demand, allowing companies to reorganize their data model without manual rework.\"If you realize you need different fields or want to reorganize your schema entirely, the system can remap and refill itself automatically,\" Peiris explained. \"You&#x27;re not locked into decisions you made on day one when you barely understood your sales process.\"The system also generates meeting preparation briefs, drafts follow-up emails based on conversation context, and can be queried in natural language — capabilities that represent a departure from the passive database model that has defined CRMs since the category&#x27;s inception in the 1980s.Sales teams report reviving dead deals and cutting response times from months to daysCustomer testimonials suggest the automation delivers measurable impact, particularly for small teams without dedicated sales operations staff. Tyler Postle, co-founder of Voker.ai, said Lightfield&#x27;s AI agent helped him revive more than 40 stalled opportunities in a single two-hour session — leads he had neglected for six months while using HubSpot.\"Within 2 days, 10 of those were revived and became active opps that moved to poc,\" Postle said. \"The problem was, instead of being a tool of action and autotracking—HubSpot was a tool where I had to do the work to record customer convos. Using HubSpot I was a data hygienist. Using Lighfield, I’m a closer.\"Postle reported that his response times to prospects improved from weeks or months to one or two days, a change noticeable enough that customers commented on it. \"Our prospects and customers have even noticed it,\" he said.Radu Spineanu, co-founder of Humble Ops, highlighted a specific feature that addresses what he views as the primary cause of lost deals: simple neglect. \"The killer feature is asking &#x27;who haven&#x27;t I followed up with?&#x27;\" Spineanu said. \"Most deals die from neglect, not rejection. Lightfield catches these dropped threads and can draft and send the follow-up immediately. That&#x27;s prevented at least three deals from going cold this quarter.\"Spineanu had evaluated competing modern CRMs including Attio and Clay before selecting Lightfield, dismissing Salesforce and HubSpot as \"built for a different era.\" He said those platforms assume companies have dedicated operations teams to configure workflows and maintain data quality — resources most early-stage companies lack.Why Y Combinator startups are rejecting Salesforce and starting with AI-native toolsPeiris claims that the current batch of Y Combinator startups — widely viewed as a bellwether for early-stage company behavior — have largely rejected both Salesforce and HubSpot. \"If you were to poll a random sampling of current YC startups and ask whether they&#x27;re using Salesforce or HubSpot, the overwhelming answer would be &#x27;no,&#x27;\" he said. \"Salesforce is too expensive, too complex to set up, and frankly doesn&#x27;t do enough to justify the investment for an early-stage company.\"According to Peiris, most startups begin with spreadsheets and eventually graduate to a first CRM — a transition point where Lightfield aims to intercede. \"Increasingly, they&#x27;re choosing Lightfield instead and skipping that intermediate step entirely,\" he said.This represents a familiar pattern in enterprise software disruption: a new generation of companies forming habits around different tools, creating an opening for challengers to establish themselves before businesses grow large enough to face pressure toward industry-standard platforms. The company&#x27;s strategy appears to deliberately target this window, aiming to grow alongside early customers and become embedded in their processes as they scale.Can Salesforce and HubSpot retrofit their legacy systems for AI, or is the architecture too old?Both Salesforce and HubSpot have announced AI features in recent quarters, adding capabilities like conversation intelligence and automated data entry to their existing platforms. The question facing Lightfield is whether established vendors can incorporate similar capabilities—leveraging their existing customer bases and integrations — or whether fundamental architectural differences create a genuine moat.Peiris argues the latter. \"The fundamental difference is in how we store data,\" he said. \"Because we have access to that complete context, the analysis we provide and the work we generate tends to be substantially higher quality than tools built on top of traditional database structures.\"Existing conversation intelligence tools like Gong and Revenue.io, which analyze sales calls and provide coaching insights, already serve similar functions but require Salesforce instances to operate. Peiris said Lightfield&#x27;s advantage comes from unifying the entire data model rather than layering analysis on top of fragmented systems.\"We have a more complete picture of each customer because we integrate company knowledge, communication sync, product analytics, and full CRM detail all in one place,\" he said. \"That unified context means the work being generated in Lightfield—whether it&#x27;s analysis, follow-ups, or insights—tends to be significantly higher quality.\"The privacy and accuracy concerns that come with AI-automated customer interactionsThe architecture creates obvious risks. Storing complete conversation histories raises privacy concerns, and relying on large language models to extract and interpret information introduces the possibility of errors—what AI researchers call hallucinations.Peiris acknowledged both issues directly. On privacy, the company maintains that call recording follows standard practices, with visible notifications that recording is in progress, and that storing sales correspondence mirrors what CRM vendors have done for decades. The company has achieved SOC 2 Type I certification and is pursuing both SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance. \"We don&#x27;t train models on customer data, period,\" Peiris said.On accuracy, he was similarly forthright. \"Of course it happens,\" Peiris said when asked about misinterpretations. \"It&#x27;s impossible to completely eliminate hallucinations when working with large language models.\"The company&#x27;s approach is to require human approval before sending customer communications or updating critical fields — positioning the system as augmentation rather than full automation. \"We&#x27;re building a tool that amplifies human judgment, not one that pretends to replace it entirely,\" Peiris said.This is a more cautious stance than some AI-native software companies have taken, reflecting both technical realism about current model capabilities and potential liability concerns around customer-facing mistakes.How Lightfield plans to consolidate ten different sales tools into one platformLightfield&#x27;s pricing strategy reflects a broader thesis about enterprise software economics. Rather than charging per-seat fees for a point solution, the company is positioning itself as a consolidated platform that can replace multiple specialized tools — sales engagement platforms, conversation intelligence systems, meeting assistants, and the CRM itself.\"The real problem is that running a modern go-to-market function requires cobbling together 10 different independent point solutions,\" Peiris said. \"When you pay for 10 separate seat licenses, you&#x27;re essentially paying 10 different companies to solve the same foundational problems over and over again.\"The company operates primarily through self-service signup rather than enterprise sales teams, which Peiris argues allows for lower pricing while maintaining margins. This is a common playbook among modern SaaS companies but represents a fundamental difference from Salesforce&#x27;s model, which relies heavily on direct sales and customer success teams.Whether this approach can support a sustainable business at scale remains unproven. The company&#x27;s current customer base skews heavily toward early-stage startups—more than 100 Y Combinator companies, according to the company — a segment with limited budgets and high failure rates.But Lightfield is betting it can become the system of record for a cohort of fast-growing companies, eventually creating an installed base comparable to how Salesforce established itself decades ago. The company&#x27;s trajectory will likely depend on whether AI capabilities alone provide sufficient differentiation—or whether incumbents can adapt quickly enough to defend their positions.The real test: whether sales teams will trust AI enough to let it run their businessThe company has outlined several areas for expansion, including an open platform for workflows and webhooks that would allow third-party integrations. Early customers have specifically requested connections with tools like Apollo for prospecting and Slack for team communication — gaps that Postle, the Voker.ai founder, acknowledged but dismissed as temporary.\"The fact that HS and Salesforce have these integrations already isn&#x27;t a moat,\" Postle said. \"HS and Salesforce are going to lose to lightfield because they aren&#x27;t AI native, no matter how much they try to pretend to be.\"Rose highlighted an unusual use case that emerged during Lightfield&#x27;s own development: the company&#x27;s product team used the CRM itself to analyze customer conversations and identify feature requests. \"In this sense, Lightfield more than just a sales database, it&#x27;s a customer intelligence layer,\" Rose said.This suggests potential applications beyond traditional sales workflows, positioning the system as infrastructure for any function that requires understanding customer needs—product development, customer success, even marketing strategy.For now, the company is focused on proving the core value proposition with early-stage companies. But the broader question Lightfield raises extends beyond CRM software specifically: whether AI capabilities have advanced sufficiently to replace structured databases as the foundation of enterprise systems, or whether the current generation of large language models remains too unreliable for business-critical functions.The answer will likely emerge not from technical benchmarks but from customer behavior—whether sales teams actually trust AI-generated insights enough to base decisions on them, and whether the efficiency gains justify the inherent unpredictability of working with systems that approximate rather than calculate.Lightfield is betting that the trade-off has already shifted in favor of approximation, at least for the millions of salespeople who currently view their CRM as an obstacle rather than an asset. Whether that bet proves correct will help define the next generation of enterprise software.",

AI models then extract structured information from this raw data on demand, allowing companies to reorganize their data model without manual rework.\"If you realize you need different fields or want to reorganize your schema entirely, the system can remap and refill itself automatically,\" Peiris explained. \"You&#x27;re not locked into decisions you made on day one when you barely understood your sales process.\"The system also generates meeting preparation briefs, drafts follow-up emails based on conversation context, and can be queried in natural language — capabilities that represent a departure from the passive database model that has defined CRMs since the category&#x27;s inception in the 1980s.Sales teams report reviving dead deals and cutting response times from months to daysCustomer testimonials suggest the automation delivers measurable impact, particularly for small teams without dedicated sales operations staff. Tyler Postle, co-founder of Voker.ai, said Lightfield&#x27;s AI agent helped him revive more than 40 stalled opportunities in a single two-hour session — leads he had neglected for six months while using HubSpot.\"Within 2 days, 10 of those were revived and became active opps that moved to poc,\" Postle said. \"The problem was, instead of being a tool of action and autotracking—HubSpot was a tool where I had to do the work to record customer convos. Using HubSpot I was a data hygienist. Using Lighfield, I’m a closer.\"Postle reported that his response times to prospects improved from weeks or months to one or two days, a change noticeable enough that customers commented on it. \"Our prospects and customers have even noticed it,\" he said.Radu Spineanu, co-founder of Humble Ops, highlighted a specific feature that addresses what he views as the primary cause of lost deals: simple neglect. \"The killer feature is asking &#x27;who haven&#x27;t I followed up with?&#x27;\" Spineanu said. \"Most deals die from neglect, not rejection. Lightfield catches these dropped threads and can draft and send the follow-up immediately. That&#x27;s prevented at least three deals from going cold this quarter.\"Spineanu had evaluated competing modern CRMs including Attio and Clay before selecting Lightfield, dismissing Salesforce and HubSpot as \"built for a different era.\" He said those platforms assume companies have dedicated operations teams to configure workflows and maintain data quality — resources most early-stage companies lack.Why Y Combinator startups are rejecting Salesforce and starting with AI-native toolsPeiris claims that the current batch of Y Combinator startups — widely viewed as a bellwether for early-stage company behavior — have largely rejected both Salesforce and HubSpot. \"If you were to poll a random sampling of current YC startups and ask whether they&#x27;re using Salesforce or HubSpot, the overwhelming answer would be &#x27;no,&#x27;\" he said. \"Salesforce is too expensive, too complex to set up, and frankly doesn&#x27;t do enough to justify the investment for an early-stage company.\"According to Peiris, most startups begin with spreadsheets and eventually graduate to a first CRM — a transition point where Lightfield aims to intercede. \"Increasingly, they&#x27;re choosing Lightfield instead and skipping that intermediate step entirely,\" he said.This represents a familiar pattern in enterprise software disruption: a new generation of companies forming habits around different tools, creating an opening for challengers to establish themselves before businesses grow large enough to face pressure toward industry-standard platforms. The company&#x27;s strategy appears to deliberately target this window, aiming to grow alongside early customers and become embedded in their processes as they scale.Can Salesforce and HubSpot retrofit their legacy systems for AI, or is the architecture too old?Both Salesforce and HubSpot have announced AI features in recent quarters, adding capabilities like conversation intelligence and automated data entry to their existing platforms. The question facing Lightfield is whether established vendors can incorporate similar capabilities—leveraging their existing customer bases and integrations — or whether fundamental architectural differences create a genuine moat.Peiris argues the latter. \"The fundamental difference is in how we store data,\" he said. \"Because we have access to that complete context, the analysis we provide and the work we generate tends to be substantially higher quality than tools built on top of traditional database structures.\"Existing conversation intelligence tools like Gong and Revenue.io, which analyze sales calls and provide coaching insights, already serve similar functions but require Salesforce instances to operate. Peiris said Lightfield&#x27;s advantage comes from unifying the entire data model rather than layering analysis on top of fragmented systems.\"We have a more complete picture of each customer because we integrate company knowledge, communication sync, product analytics, and full CRM detail all in one place,\" he said. \"That unified context means the work being generated in Lightfield—whether it&#x27;s analysis, follow-ups, or insights—tends to be significantly higher quality.\"The privacy and accuracy concerns that come with AI-automated customer interactionsThe architecture creates obvious risks. Storing complete conversation histories raises privacy concerns, and relying on large language models to extract and interpret information introduces the possibility of errors—what AI researchers call hallucinations.Peiris acknowledged both issues directly. On privacy, the company maintains that call recording follows standard practices, with visible notifications that recording is in progress, and that storing sales correspondence mirrors what CRM vendors have done for decades. The company has achieved SOC 2 Type I certification and is pursuing both SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliance. \"We don&#x27;t train models on customer data, period,\" Peiris said.On accuracy, he was similarly forthright. \"Of course it happens,\" Peiris said when asked about misinterpretations. \"It&#x27;s impossible to completely eliminate hallucinations when working with large language models.\"The company&#x27;s approach is to require human approval before sending customer communications or updating critical fields — positioning the system as augmentation rather than full automation. \"We&#x27;re building a tool that amplifies human judgment, not one that pretends to replace it entirely,\" Peiris said.This is a more cautious stance than some AI-native software companies have taken, reflecting both technical realism about current model capabilities and potential liability concerns around customer-facing mistakes.How Lightfield plans to consolidate ten different sales tools into one platformLightfield&#x27;s pricing strategy reflects a broader thesis about enterprise software economics. Rather than charging per-seat fees for a point solution, the company is positioning itself as a consolidated platform that can replace multiple specialized tools — sales engagement platforms, conversation intelligence systems, meeting assistants, and the CRM itself.\"The real problem is that running a modern go-to-market function requires cobbling together 10 different independent point solutions,\" Peiris said. \"When you pay for 10 separate seat licenses, you&#x27;re essentially paying 10 different companies to solve the same foundational problems over and over again.\"The company operates primarily through self-service signup rather than enterprise sales teams, which Peiris argues allows for lower pricing while maintaining margins. This is a common playbook among modern SaaS companies but represents a fundamental difference from Salesforce&#x27;s model, which relies heavily on direct sales and customer success teams.Whether this approach can support a sustainable business at scale remains unproven. The company&#x27;s current customer base skews heavily toward early-stage startups—more than 100 Y Combinator companies, according to the company — a segment with limited budgets and high failure rates.But Lightfield is betting it can become the system of record for a cohort of fast-growing companies, eventually creating an installed base comparable to how Salesforce established itself decades ago. The company&#x27;s trajectory will likely depend on whether AI capabilities alone provide sufficient differentiation—or whether incumbents can adapt quickly enough to defend their positions.The real test: whether sales teams will trust AI enough to let it run their businessThe company has outlined several areas for expansion, including an open platform for workflows and webhooks that would allow third-party integrations. Early customers have specifically requested connections with tools like Apollo for prospecting and Slack for team communication — gaps that Postle, the Voker.ai founder, acknowledged but dismissed as temporary.\"The fact that HS and Salesforce have these integrations already isn&#x27;t a moat,\" Postle said. \"HS and Salesforce are going to lose to lightfield because they aren&#x27;t AI native, no matter how much they try to pretend to be.\"Rose highlighted an unusual use case that emerged during Lightfield&#x27;s own development: the company&#x27;s product team used the CRM itself to analyze customer conversations and identify feature requests. \"In this sense, Lightfield more than just a sales database, it&#x27;s a customer intelligence layer,\" Rose said.This suggests potential applications beyond traditional sales workflows, positioning the system as infrastructure for any function that requires understanding customer needs—product development, customer success, even marketing strategy.For now, the company is focused on proving the core value proposition with early-stage companies. But the broader question Lightfield raises extends beyond CRM software specifically: whether AI capabilities have advanced sufficiently to replace structured databases as the foundation of enterprise systems, or whether the current generation of large language models remains too unreliable for business-critical functions.The answer will likely emerge not from technical benchmarks but from customer behavior—whether sales teams actually trust AI-generated insights enough to base decisions on them, and whether the efficiency gains justify the inherent unpredictability of working with systems that approximate rather than calculate.Lightfield is betting that the trade-off has already shifted in favor of approximation, at least for the millions of salespeople who currently view their CRM as an obstacle rather than an asset. Whether that bet proves correct will help define the next generation of enterprise software.",

The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in our review, now for less. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

          "standfirst": "The AirPods Pro 3 are now on sale for $220, marking the biggest discount since launch. That’s a solid price for Apple’s newest earbuds, which bring improved sound, longer battery life and upgraded noise cancellation in a familiar, comfortable design. Previously, the lowest we saw Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 go down to was $239. This is a deal worth considering, as we can’t guarantee they’ll be discounted further anytime soon. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $110 right now as well.

That's $100 off what Engadget's Nathan Ingraham called \"a great speaker, whether or not it is playing songs in Dolby Atmos.\" That Dolby reference points to the Era 300's core novelty. It produces spatial audio without requiring additional speakers. (You can use Apple Music or Amazon Music to stream compatible tracks.) Expect those Dolby Atmos tracks to sound better with newer music than older songs remixed for Dolby's tech. Even if you don't bother with its spatial tricks, the Era 300 is a terrific-sounding speaker. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers. The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don't need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That's especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only. If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Black Friday. You can get the smaller — but still mighty — Era 100 for $169 (23 percent off). The portable Move 2 is down to $399 (20 percent off). Even the company's headphones, Sonos Ace, are on sale for $279 (30 percent off). Sonos home theater products are discounted, too. You can get the Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off), or the Sub 4 subwoofer for $719 (also 20 percent off). Or, if you're in the market for both and have the budget, save even more on a bundle: Get the Arc Ultra and Sub 4 for $1,499 (25 percent off).

The Roku Streaming Stick Plus, which just happens to be one of our favorite streaming devices, is 50 percent off, on sale for just $20. The regular Streaming Stick and Streaming Stick 4K are also on sale for 47 percent and 50 percent off, coming in at $16 and $25 respectively. Roku makes some of the best streaming devices you can get, and any of the ones on sale would be great picks to upgrade an old TV you already have. The Streaming Stick Plus is our favorite of the bunch since it supports 4K HDR content and gives you access to a bunch of free content thanks to Roku's streaming OS. We also appreciate its accurate universal search and the fact that it draws power from your TV, so it doesn't need to be plugged into a wall outlet to get power. The standard Streaming Stick is a good alternative to Amazon's most basic Fire TV Stick, and if you already prefer Roku's streaming OS, it's arguably the better choice. The Streaming Stick 4K adds Dolby Vision into the mix, if that's a must-have for you. Also, if you're looking for a more powerful set-top streaming box, the Roku Ultra is 30 percent off, marked down to $70 from $100.

          "standfirst": "Looking to keep your home clean without having to vacuum and mop every day, pick up dirt, the dinner your child threw on the floor or your furry friend’s endless pet hair? Join the club. Smart home gadgets have come a long way over the years, and that includes robot vacuums. With newer technology including voice controls, object detection and more automation features, investing in a robot vacuum cleaner makes more sense now than ever before. Some of the best robot vacuum cleaners even have mopping capabilities, roller brush options and self-emptying bases, too, and there are plenty that don't cost a fortune either. If you’re ready to adopt a less hands-on approach and let a robot vacuum cleaner do the hard work for you, consider our recommendations below. Table of contents Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in a robot vacuum Robot vacuum maintenance tips How we test robot vacuums Robot vacuum FAQs Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in the best robot vacuums Floor type We recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode. Vacuum suction Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home. Wi-Fi connectivity As we explained in our budget guide, Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it’s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone. Mapping features and object detection Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine. Self-empty station Finally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself. Robot vacuums with mopping capabilities Mopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. How we test robot vacuums We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine. If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more. Robot vacuum FAQs Are robot vacuums worth it? We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. How long do robot vacuums last? Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.

We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine. If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more. Robot vacuum FAQs Are robot vacuums worth it? We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. How long do robot vacuums last? Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.

You can grab a four-pack of these Bluetooth trackers for $65, the lowest price to date. This deal makes the price per AirTag drop to just $16, far cheaper than their usual $29 each. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

Olmo 3 has a longer context window, more reasoning traces and is better at coding than its previous iteration. This latest version, like the other Olmo releases, is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. Enterprises will have complete transparency into and control over the training data and checkpointing. Ai2 will release three versions of Olmo 3:Olmo 3- Think in both 7B and 32B are considered the flagship reasoning models for advanced researchOlmo 3- Base also in both parameters, which is ideal for programming, comprehension, math and long-context reasoning. Ai2 said this version is “ideal for continued pre-training or fine-tuningOlmo 3-Instruct in 7B that is optimized for instruction following, multi-turn dialogue and tool useThe company said Olmo 3- Think is the “first-ever fully open 32B thinking model that generates explicit reasoning-chain-style content.” Olmo-3 Think also has a long context window of 65,000 tokens, perfect for longer-running agentic projects or reasoning over longer documents. Noah Smith, Ai2’s senior director of NLP research, told VentureBeat in an interview that many of its customers, from regulated enterprises to research institutions, want to use models that give them assurance about what went into the training. “The releases from our friends in the tech world are very cool and super exciting, but there are a lot of people for whom data privacy control over what goes into the model, how the models train and other constraints on how the model can be used as front of mind,” said Smith. Developers can access the models on Hugging Face and the Ai2 Playground. Transparency and customizationSmith said models like Olmo 3, which the company believes any organization using its models has to have control over and mold in the way that best works for them.“We don&#x27;t believe in one-size-fits-all solutions,” Smith said. It&#x27;s a known thing in the world of machine learning that if you try and build a model that solves all the problems, it ends up not being really the best model for any one problem. There aren&#x27;t formal proofs of that, but it&#x27;s a thing that old timers like me have kind of observed.”He added that models with the ability to specialize “are maybe not as flash as getting high scores on math exams” but offer more flexibility for enterprises. Olmo 3 allows enterprises to essentially retrain the model by adding to the data mix it learns from. The idea is that businesses can bring in their proprietary sources to guide the model in answering specific company queries. To help enterprises during this process, Ai2 added checkpoints from every major training phase. Demand for model customization has grown as enterprises that cannot build their own LLMs want to create company-specific or industry-focused models. Startups like Arcee have begun offering enterprise-focused, customizable small models. Models like Olmo 3, Smith said, also give enterprises more confidence in the technology. Since Olmo 3 provides the training data, Smith said enterprises can trust that the model did not ingest anything it shouldn’t have.Ai2 has always claimed to be committed to greater transparency, even launching a tool called OlmoTrace in April that can track a model’s output directly back to the original training data. The company releases open-sourced models and posts its code to repositories like GitHub for anyone to use. Competitors like Google and OpenAI have faced criticism from developers over moves that hid raw reasoning tokens and chose to summarize reasoning, claiming that they now resort to “debugging blind” without transparency. Ai2 pretrained Olmo 3 on the six-trillion-token OpenAI dataset, Dolma 3. The dataset encompasses web data, scientific literature and code. Smith said they optimized Olmo 3 for code, compared to the focus on math for Olmo 2. How it stacks upAi2 claims that the Olmo 3 family of models represents a significant leap for truly open-source models, at least for open-source LLMs developed outside China. The base Olmo 3 model trained “with roughly 2.5x greater compute efficiency as measured by GPU-hours per token,” meaning it consumed less energy during pre-training and costs less.The company said the Olmo 3 models outperformed other open models, such as Marin from Stanford, LLM360’s K2, and Apertus, though Ai2 did not provide figures for the benchmark testing. “Of note, Olmo 3-Think (32B) is the strongest fully open reasoning model, narrowing the gap to the best open-weight models of similar scale, such as the Qwen 3-32B-Thinking series of models across our suite of reasoning benchmarks, all while being trained on 6x fewer tokens,” Ai2 said in a press release.

          "title": "OpenAI debuts GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max coding model and it already completed a 24-hour task internally",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI has introduced GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, a new frontier agentic coding model now available in its Codex developer environment. The release marks a significant step forward in AI-assisted software engineering, offering improved long-horizon reasoning, efficiency, and real-time interactive capabilities. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will now replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model across Codex-integrated surfaces.The new model is designed to serve as a persistent, high-context software development agent, capable of managing complex refactors, debugging workflows, and project-scale tasks across multiple context windows.It comes on the heels of Google releasing its powerful new Gemini 3 Pro model yesterday, yet still outperforms or matches it on key coding benchmarks: On SWE-Bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieved 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, edging past Gemini 3 Pro’s 76.2%. It also led on Terminal-Bench 2.0, with 58.1% accuracy versus Gemini’s 54.2%, and matched Gemini’s score of 2,439 on LiveCodeBench Pro, a competitive coding Elo benchmark.When measured against Gemini 3 Pro’s most advanced configuration — its Deep Thinking model — Codex-Max holds a slight edge in agentic coding benchmarks, as well. Performance Benchmarks: Incremental Gains Across Key TasksGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max demonstrates measurable improvements over GPT‑5.1-Codex across a range of standard software engineering benchmarks. On SWE-Lancer IC SWE, it achieved 79.9% accuracy, a significant increase from GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 66.3%. In SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), it reached 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, outperforming GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 73.7%.Performance on Terminal Bench 2.0 (n=89) showed more modest improvements, with GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieving 58.1% accuracy compared to 52.8% for GPT‑5.1-Codex. All evaluations were run with compaction and extra-high reasoning effort enabled.These results indicate that the new model offers a higher ceiling on both benchmarked correctness and real-world usability under extended reasoning loads.Technical Architecture: Long-Horizon Reasoning via CompactionA major architectural improvement in GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is its ability to reason effectively over extended input-output sessions using a mechanism called compaction. This enables the model to retain key contextual information while discarding irrelevant details as it nears its context window limit — effectively allowing for continuous work across millions of tokens without performance degradation.The model has been internally observed to complete tasks lasting more than 24 hours, including multi-step refactors, test-driven iteration, and autonomous debugging.Compaction also improves token efficiency. At medium reasoning effort, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max used approximately 30% fewer thinking tokens than GPT‑5.1-Codex for comparable or better accuracy, which has implications for both cost and latency.Platform Integration and Use CasesGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is currently available across multiple Codex-based environments, which refer to OpenAI’s own integrated tools and interfaces built specifically for code-focused AI agents. These include:Codex CLI, OpenAI’s official command-line tool (@openai/codex), where GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is already live.IDE extensions, likely developed or maintained by OpenAI, though no specific third-party IDE integrations were named.Interactive coding environments, such as those used to demonstrate frontend simulation apps like CartPole or Snell’s Law Explorer.Internal code review tooling, used by OpenAI’s engineering teams.For now, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is not yet available via public API, though OpenAI states this is coming soon. Users who wish to work with the model in terminal environments today can do so by installing and using the Codex CLI.It is not currently confirmed whether or how the model will integrate into third-party IDEs unless they are built on top of the CLI or future API.The model is capable of interacting with live tools and simulations. Examples shown in the release include:An interactive CartPole policy gradient simulator, which visualizes reinforcement learning training and activations.A Snell’s Law optics explorer, supporting dynamic ray tracing across refractive indices.These interfaces exemplify the model’s ability to reason in real time while maintaining an interactive development session — effectively bridging computation, visualization, and implementation within a single loop.Cybersecurity and Safety ConstraintsWhile GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not meet OpenAI’s “High” capability threshold for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework, it is currently the most capable cybersecurity model OpenAI has deployed.

          "content": "OpenAI has introduced GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, a new frontier agentic coding model now available in its Codex developer environment. The release marks a significant step forward in AI-assisted software engineering, offering improved long-horizon reasoning, efficiency, and real-time interactive capabilities. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will now replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model across Codex-integrated surfaces.The new model is designed to serve as a persistent, high-context software development agent, capable of managing complex refactors, debugging workflows, and project-scale tasks across multiple context windows.It comes on the heels of Google releasing its powerful new Gemini 3 Pro model yesterday, yet still outperforms or matches it on key coding benchmarks: On SWE-Bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieved 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, edging past Gemini 3 Pro’s 76.2%. It also led on Terminal-Bench 2.0, with 58.1% accuracy versus Gemini’s 54.2%, and matched Gemini’s score of 2,439 on LiveCodeBench Pro, a competitive coding Elo benchmark.When measured against Gemini 3 Pro’s most advanced configuration — its Deep Thinking model — Codex-Max holds a slight edge in agentic coding benchmarks, as well. Performance Benchmarks: Incremental Gains Across Key TasksGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max demonstrates measurable improvements over GPT‑5.1-Codex across a range of standard software engineering benchmarks. On SWE-Lancer IC SWE, it achieved 79.9% accuracy, a significant increase from GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 66.3%. In SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), it reached 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, outperforming GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 73.7%.Performance on Terminal Bench 2.0 (n=89) showed more modest improvements, with GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieving 58.1% accuracy compared to 52.8% for GPT‑5.1-Codex. All evaluations were run with compaction and extra-high reasoning effort enabled.These results indicate that the new model offers a higher ceiling on both benchmarked correctness and real-world usability under extended reasoning loads.Technical Architecture: Long-Horizon Reasoning via CompactionA major architectural improvement in GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is its ability to reason effectively over extended input-output sessions using a mechanism called compaction. This enables the model to retain key contextual information while discarding irrelevant details as it nears its context window limit — effectively allowing for continuous work across millions of tokens without performance degradation.The model has been internally observed to complete tasks lasting more than 24 hours, including multi-step refactors, test-driven iteration, and autonomous debugging.Compaction also improves token efficiency. At medium reasoning effort, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max used approximately 30% fewer thinking tokens than GPT‑5.1-Codex for comparable or better accuracy, which has implications for both cost and latency.Platform Integration and Use CasesGPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is currently available across multiple Codex-based environments, which refer to OpenAI’s own integrated tools and interfaces built specifically for code-focused AI agents. These include:Codex CLI, OpenAI’s official command-line tool (@openai/codex), where GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is already live.IDE extensions, likely developed or maintained by OpenAI, though no specific third-party IDE integrations were named.Interactive coding environments, such as those used to demonstrate frontend simulation apps like CartPole or Snell’s Law Explorer.Internal code review tooling, used by OpenAI’s engineering teams.For now, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is not yet available via public API, though OpenAI states this is coming soon. Users who wish to work with the model in terminal environments today can do so by installing and using the Codex CLI.It is not currently confirmed whether or how the model will integrate into third-party IDEs unless they are built on top of the CLI or future API.The model is capable of interacting with live tools and simulations. Examples shown in the release include:An interactive CartPole policy gradient simulator, which visualizes reinforcement learning training and activations.A Snell’s Law optics explorer, supporting dynamic ray tracing across refractive indices.These interfaces exemplify the model’s ability to reason in real time while maintaining an interactive development session — effectively bridging computation, visualization, and implementation within a single loop.Cybersecurity and Safety ConstraintsWhile GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not meet OpenAI’s “High” capability threshold for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework, it is currently the most capable cybersecurity model OpenAI has deployed. It supports use cases such as automated vulnerability detection and remediation, but with strict sandboxing and disabled network access by default.OpenAI reports no increase in scaled malicious use but has introduced enhanced monitoring systems, including activity routing and disruption mechanisms for suspicious behavior.

          "standfirst": "Fetch AI, a startup founded and led by former DeepMind founding investor, Humayun Sheikh, on Wednesday announced the release of three interconnected products designed to provide the trust, coordination, and interoperability needed for large-scale AI agent ecosystems. The launch includes ASI:One, a personal-AI orchestration platform; Fetch Business, a verification and discovery portal for brand agents; and Agentverse, an open directory hosting more than two million agents. Together, the system positions Fetch as an infrastructure provider for what it calls the “Agentic Web”—a layer where consumer AIs and brand AIs collaborate to complete tasks instead of merely suggesting them.The company says the tools address a central limitation in current consumer AI: models can provide recommendations but cannot reliably execute multi-step actions that require coordination across businesses. Fetch’s approach centers on enabling agents from different organizations to interoperate securely, using verified identities and shared context to complete end-to-end workflows.“We’re creating the same foundation for agents that Google created for websites,” said Humayun Sheikh, Founder and CEO of Fetch AI, and an early investor in DeepMind, in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “Instead of just finding information, your personal AI coordinates with verified brand agents to get things done.”Fetch’s founding and DeepMind connection Fetch AI was founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh, an entrepreneur whose early investment in DeepMind helped support the company’s commercial development before its acquisition by Google. “I was one of the first five people at DeepMind and its first investor. My check was the first one in,” Sheikh said, reflecting on the period when advanced machine learning research was still largely inaccessible outside major technology companies.His early experience helped shape Fetch’s direction. “Even in 2013, it was clear to me that agentic systems were going to be the ones that worked. That’s where I focused—on the agentic web,” Sheikh noted. Fetch built on this thesis by developing infrastructure for autonomous software agents, focusing on verifiable identity, secure data exchange, and multi-agent coordination. Over the past several years, the company has expanded to a 70-person team across Cambridge and Menlo Park, raised approximately $60 million, and accumulated more than one million users interacting with its model—data that informed the design of the newly launched products.Sheikh added that his decision to bootstrap the company initially came directly from the proceeds of the DeepMind exit, noting in the interview that while the sale to Google was “a good exit,” he believed the team could have held out for a higher valuation. The early self-funding period allowed Fetch to begin work in 2015—well before transformer architectures went mainstream—on the hypothesis that agentic infrastructure would become foundational to applied AI.ASI:One is a platform for multi-agent orchestrationAt the core of the launch is ASI:One, a language model interface designed specifically for coordinating multiple agents rather than addressing isolated queries. Fetch describes it as an “intelligence layer” that handles context sharing, task routing, and preference modeling.The system stores user-level signals such as favored airlines, dietary constraints, budget ranges, loyalty program identifiers, and calendar availability. When a user requests a complex task — such as planning a trip with flights, hotels, and restaurant reservations — ASI:One retrieves those preferences and delegates work to the appropriate verified agents. The agents then return actionable outputs, including inventory and booking options, rather than generic recommendations.In practice, ASI:One functions as a workflow generator across organizational boundaries. By contrast with conventional LLM applications, which often rely on APIs or RAG techniques to surface information, ASI:One is built to coordinate autonomous agents that can complete transactions. Fetch notes that personalization improves over time as the model accumulates structured preference data.Sheikh emphasized the distinction between orchestrated execution and traditional AI output. “This isn’t searching for options separately and hoping they work together,” he said. “It’s orchestration.” He added that Fetch’s architecture is intentionally modular: “Our architecture is a mix of agentic and expert models. One large model isn’t enough — you need specialists. That’s why we built ASI1, tuned specifically for agentic systems.”The interview also revealed new details about ASI:One’s personalization systems: the platform uses multiple user-owned knowledge graphs to store preferences, travel history, social connections, and contextual constraints. These knowledge graphs are siloed per user and not co-mingled with any Fetch-operated data. Sheikh described this as a “deterministic backbone” that gives the personal AI a stable memory layer beyond the probabilistic output of a single large model.ASI:One launches in Beta today, with a broader release planned for early 2026. Fetch also offers ASI:One Mobile, released earlier this year, giving users access to the same agent-orchestration capabilities on iOS and Android. The mobile app connects directly to Agentverse and the user’s knowledge graphs, enabling on-the-go task execution and real-time interaction with registered agents.Fetch Business offers verified identity and brand controlTo enable reliable coordination between consumers and companies, Fetch is introducing a verification and discovery portal called Fetch Business. The platform allows organizations to verify their identity and claim an official Brand Agent handle — for example, @Hilton or @Nike — regardless of which tools they use to build the underlying agent.Fetch positions the product as an analogue to ICANN domain registration and SSL certificate systems for websites. Verified status is intended to protect consumers from interacting with counterfeit or untrusted agents, a problem the company describes as a major barrier to widespread agent adoption.The system includes low-code tools for small businesses to create agents in a few steps and connect real-time APIs such as inventory, booking systems, or CRM platforms. “With Fetch, you can create an agent in one minute. It gets a handle, like a Twitter username, and you can personalize it completely—even give it your social media permissions to post on your behalf,” Sheikh said. Once a brand claims its namespace, its agent becomes discoverable to consumer AIs and other agents inside Agentverse.The company has pre-reserved thousands of brand namespaces in anticipation of demand. Verification status persists across any platform that integrates with Agentverse, creating a portable identity layer for business agents.The interview highlighted that Fetch Business inherits web-trust primitives directly: domain owners verify their identity by inserting a short code snippet into their existing website backend, allowing the system to pass a cryptographic challenge and grant the agent an authenticity badge similar to a “blue check” for agent identities. Sheikh framed this as “reusing the trust layer the web already spent decades building.”Companies can begin claiming agents now at business.fetch.ai.Agentverse is an open directory of more yhan 2 million agentsThe final component of the release is Agentverse, an open directory and cloud platform that hosts agents and enables cross-ecosystem discoverability. Fetch states that millions of agents have already registered, spanning travel, retail, entertainment, food service, and enterprise categories.Agentverse provides metadata, capability descriptions, and routing logic that ASI:One uses to identify appropriate agents for specific tasks. It also supports secure communication and data exchange between agents. The company notes that the directory is platform-agnostic: agents built with any framework can join and interoperate.According to Sheikh, the lack of a discovery layer is one reason most AI agents see little or no usage. “Ninety percent of AI agents never get used because there’s no discovery layer,” he said. He framed the role of Agentverse in more technical terms: “Right now, if you build an agent, there’s no universal way for others to discover it. That’s what AgentVerse solves—it’s like DNS for agents.” He also described the system as an essential component of the emerging agent economy: “Fetch is building the Google of agents. Just like websites needed search, agents need discovery, trust, and interaction—Fetch provides all of that.”The interview further underscored that Agentverse is cloud-agnostic by design. Sheikh contrasted this with competing agent ecosystems tied to specific cloud providers, arguing that a universal registry is only viable if independent of proprietary cloud environments. He said the open architecture enables an LLM to query any agent “within one minute of deployment,” turning agent publication into a near-instantaneous process similar to registering a domain.Agentverse also integrates payment pathways, enabling agents to execute purchases using partners such as Visa, Skyfire, and supported stablecoins. Consumers can configure spending limits or require explicit approval for transactions.Industry context and implicationsFetch’s launch comes at a time when consumer AI platforms are exploring the shift from static chat interfaces toward autonomous agents capable of completing actions. However, most agent systems remain limited by siloed architectures, limited interoperability, and weak verification standards.Fetch positions its infrastructure as a response to these limitations by providing a cross-platform coordination layer, identity system, and directory service. The company argues that an agent ecosystem requires consistent verification mechanisms to ensure that consumers interact with authentic brand representatives rather than imitations. By establishing namespace control and portable trust indicators, Fetch Business aims to fill a gap similar to early web domain verification.At the same time, ASI:One attempts to centralize user preference data in a way that enables more efficient personalization and multi-agent coordination. This approach differs from generalist LLM applications, which often lack persistent preference architectures or direct access to brand-controlled agents.The interview also made clear that micropayments and digital transaction infrastructure are central to Fetch’s long-term vision. Sheikh referenced integrations with protocols such as Coinbase’s 402 and AP2, positioning these capabilities as essential for autonomous agents to complete end-to-end tasks that include financial execution.Fetch’s combined release of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse introduces an interconnected stack designed to support large-scale deployment and usage of AI agents. The company frames the system as foundational infrastructure for an agentic ecosystem, where consumer AIs can coordinate with verified brand agents to complete tasks reliably and securely. The additions to its identity, discovery, and orchestration layers reflect Fetch’s long-standing thesis — rooted partly in lessons from DeepMind’s early development — that intelligence becomes meaningful only when paired with the capacity to act.",

          "title": "OpenCV founders launch AI video startup to take on OpenAI and Google",
          "standfirst": "A new artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of the world&#x27;s most widely used computer vision library has emerged from stealth with technology that generates realistic human-centric videos up to five minutes long — a dramatic leap beyond the capabilities of rivals including OpenAI&#x27;s Sora and Google&#x27;s Veo.CraftStory, which launched Tuesday with $2 million in funding, is introducing Model 2.0, a video generation system that addresses one of the most significant limitations plaguing the nascent AI video industry: duration. While OpenAI&#x27;s Sora 2 tops out at 25 seconds and most competing models generate clips of 10 seconds or less, CraftStory&#x27;s system can produce continuous, coherent video performances that run as long as a typical YouTube tutorial or product demonstration.The breakthrough could unlock substantial commercial value for enterprises struggling to scale video production for training, marketing, and customer education — markets where brief AI-generated clips have proven inadequate despite their visual polish.\"If you really try to create a video with one of these video generation systems, you find that a lot of the times you want to implement a certain creative vision, and regardless of how detailed the instructions are, the systems basically ignore a part of your instructions,\" said Victor Erukhimov, CraftStory&#x27;s founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We developed a system that can generate videos basically as long as you need them.\"How parallel processing solves the long-form video problemCraftStory&#x27;s advance rests on what the company describes as a parallelized diffusion architecture — a fundamentally different approach to how AI models generate video compared to the sequential methods employed by most competitors.Traditional video generation models work by running diffusion algorithms on increasingly large three-dimensional volumes where time represents the third axis. To generate a longer video, these models require proportionally larger networks, more training data, and significantly more computational resources.CraftStory instead runs multiple smaller diffusion algorithms simultaneously across the entire duration of the video, with bidirectional constraints connecting them. \"The latter part of the video can influence the former part of the video too,\" Erukhimov explained. \"And this is pretty important, because if you do it one by one, then an artifact that appears in the first part propagates to the second one, and then it accumulates.\"Rather than generating eight seconds and then stitching on additional segments, CraftStory&#x27;s system processes all five minutes concurrently through interconnected diffusion processes.Crucially, CraftStory trained its model on proprietary footage rather than relying solely on internet-scraped videos. The company hired studios to shoot actors using high-frame-rate camera systems that capture crisp detail even in fast-moving elements like fingers — avoiding the motion blur inherent in standard 30-frames-per-second YouTube clips.\"What we showed is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of data and you don&#x27;t need a lot of training budget to create high quality videos,\" Erukhimov said. \"You just need high quality data.\"Model 2.0 currently operates as a video-to-video system: users upload a still image to animate and a \"driving video\" containing a person whose movements the AI will replicate. CraftStory provides preset driving videos shot with professional actors, who receive revenue shares when their motion data is used, or users can upload their own footage.The system generates 30-second clips at low resolution in approximately 15 minutes. An advanced lip-sync system synchronizes mouth movements to scripts or audio tracks, while gesture alignment algorithms ensure body language matches speech rhythm and emotional tone.Fighting a war chest battle with $2 million against billionsCraftStory&#x27;s funding comes almost entirely from Andrew Filev, who sold his project management software company Wrike to Citrix for $2.25 billion in 2021 and now runs Zencoder, an AI coding company. The modest raise stands in stark contrast to the billions flowing into competing efforts — OpenAI has raised over $6 billion in its latest funding round alone.Erukhimov pushed back on the notion that massive capital is prerequisite for success. \"I don&#x27;t necessarily buy the thesis that compute is the path to success,\" he said. \"It definitely helps if you have compute. But if you raise a billion dollars on a PowerPoint, in the end, no one is happy, neither the founders nor the investors.\"Filev defended the David-versus-Goliath approach. \"When you invest in startups, you&#x27;re fundamentally betting on people,\" he said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"To paraphrase Margaret Mead: never underestimate what a small group of thoughtful, committed engineers and scientists can build.\"He argued that CraftStory benefits from a focused strategy. \"The big labs are in an arms race to build general-purpose video foundation models,\" Filev said. \"CraftStory is riding that wave and going very deep into a specific format: long-form, engaging, human-centric video.\"Why computer vision expertise matters in generative AI videoErukhimov&#x27;s credibility stems from his deep roots in computer vision rather than the transformer architectures that have dominated recent AI advances.

          "content": "A new artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of the world&#x27;s most widely used computer vision library has emerged from stealth with technology that generates realistic human-centric videos up to five minutes long — a dramatic leap beyond the capabilities of rivals including OpenAI&#x27;s Sora and Google&#x27;s Veo.CraftStory, which launched Tuesday with $2 million in funding, is introducing Model 2.0, a video generation system that addresses one of the most significant limitations plaguing the nascent AI video industry: duration. While OpenAI&#x27;s Sora 2 tops out at 25 seconds and most competing models generate clips of 10 seconds or less, CraftStory&#x27;s system can produce continuous, coherent video performances that run as long as a typical YouTube tutorial or product demonstration.The breakthrough could unlock substantial commercial value for enterprises struggling to scale video production for training, marketing, and customer education — markets where brief AI-generated clips have proven inadequate despite their visual polish.\"If you really try to create a video with one of these video generation systems, you find that a lot of the times you want to implement a certain creative vision, and regardless of how detailed the instructions are, the systems basically ignore a part of your instructions,\" said Victor Erukhimov, CraftStory&#x27;s founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We developed a system that can generate videos basically as long as you need them.\"How parallel processing solves the long-form video problemCraftStory&#x27;s advance rests on what the company describes as a parallelized diffusion architecture — a fundamentally different approach to how AI models generate video compared to the sequential methods employed by most competitors.Traditional video generation models work by running diffusion algorithms on increasingly large three-dimensional volumes where time represents the third axis. To generate a longer video, these models require proportionally larger networks, more training data, and significantly more computational resources.CraftStory instead runs multiple smaller diffusion algorithms simultaneously across the entire duration of the video, with bidirectional constraints connecting them. \"The latter part of the video can influence the former part of the video too,\" Erukhimov explained. \"And this is pretty important, because if you do it one by one, then an artifact that appears in the first part propagates to the second one, and then it accumulates.\"Rather than generating eight seconds and then stitching on additional segments, CraftStory&#x27;s system processes all five minutes concurrently through interconnected diffusion processes.Crucially, CraftStory trained its model on proprietary footage rather than relying solely on internet-scraped videos. The company hired studios to shoot actors using high-frame-rate camera systems that capture crisp detail even in fast-moving elements like fingers — avoiding the motion blur inherent in standard 30-frames-per-second YouTube clips.\"What we showed is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of data and you don&#x27;t need a lot of training budget to create high quality videos,\" Erukhimov said. \"You just need high quality data.\"Model 2.0 currently operates as a video-to-video system: users upload a still image to animate and a \"driving video\" containing a person whose movements the AI will replicate. CraftStory provides preset driving videos shot with professional actors, who receive revenue shares when their motion data is used, or users can upload their own footage.The system generates 30-second clips at low resolution in approximately 15 minutes. An advanced lip-sync system synchronizes mouth movements to scripts or audio tracks, while gesture alignment algorithms ensure body language matches speech rhythm and emotional tone.Fighting a war chest battle with $2 million against billionsCraftStory&#x27;s funding comes almost entirely from Andrew Filev, who sold his project management software company Wrike to Citrix for $2.25 billion in 2021 and now runs Zencoder, an AI coding company. The modest raise stands in stark contrast to the billions flowing into competing efforts — OpenAI has raised over $6 billion in its latest funding round alone.Erukhimov pushed back on the notion that massive capital is prerequisite for success. \"I don&#x27;t necessarily buy the thesis that compute is the path to success,\" he said. \"It definitely helps if you have compute. But if you raise a billion dollars on a PowerPoint, in the end, no one is happy, neither the founders nor the investors.\"Filev defended the David-versus-Goliath approach. \"When you invest in startups, you&#x27;re fundamentally betting on people,\" he said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"To paraphrase Margaret Mead: never underestimate what a small group of thoughtful, committed engineers and scientists can build.\"He argued that CraftStory benefits from a focused strategy. \"The big labs are in an arms race to build general-purpose video foundation models,\" Filev said. \"CraftStory is riding that wave and going very deep into a specific format: long-form, engaging, human-centric video.\"Why computer vision expertise matters in generative AI videoErukhimov&#x27;s credibility stems from his deep roots in computer vision rather than the transformer architectures that have dominated recent AI advances. He was an early contributor to OpenCV — the Open Source Computer Vision Library that has become the de facto standard for computer vision applications, with over 84,000 stars on GitHub.When Intel reduced its support for OpenCV in the mid-2000s, Erukhimov co-founded Itseez with the explicit goal of maintaining and advancing the library.

Starting today, Google is rolling out its Gemini AI assistant to Android Auto users, allowing drivers access to a “truly conversational” voice assistant who can help with directions, messages, and errands. With Gemini, “you can just speak naturally, have a back and forth conversation and get more complex tasks done,” says Guemmy Kim, Senior Director of Product & User Experience, Android for Cars, in a blog post published today. Customers will need to download the Gemini app on their Android phone, which they will then see on their car’s infotainment display while projecting Android Auto. They can then activate the AI assistant by saying “Hey Google,” pressing the mic button on their car screen, or long pressing the voice control button on their steering wheel. To be sure, Gemini is not available for users Apple CarPlay, nor will it be anytime soon. Google spokesperson Sofia Giovannello said the company didn’t have any updates to share on that front. For months, Google has been cramming Gemini to a host of platforms it controls, from Chrome to Google Maps to Nest and Google Home products. But Android Auto is among the first attempts to bring the AI chatbot in to the world of driving. Google says that vehicles with its built-in Android operating systems will be next; Polestar, for example, recently announced that a future software update would bring Gemini to its lineup of electric sports cars. Gemini should offer a step change over the current crop of voice assistants, Google claims. For example, you can ask it for help finding restaurants with a specific cuisine, tell it to message your friends with your ETA with an added emoji, check your calendar for events, make a to-do list, and find addresses buried in your emails. And most importantly, you can purportedly do all this while keeping your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. Google says that Gemini can also just hang and chat if that’s what you want. According to Kim, the chatbot can “help you learn something new, brainstorm ideas, rehearse for important moments and much more, all in one continuous conversation.” But will this help drivers focus on the task of driving, or just be another distraction? There’s early research that suggests that speech-based voice assistants in the car are associated with “a rather moderate than high level of cognitive distraction.” There is an assumption that anything that helps prevent you from looking at your phone while driving is an improvement, but that might not necessarily be the case. More research will be needed, especially as tech companies rush to introduce more powerful, AI assistants to the in-car experience.",

Nano Banana Pro is part of the newly launched Gemini 3 Pro—it’s actually called Gemini 3 Pro Image in the same way the original is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, but Google is sticking with the meme-y name. You can access it by selecting Gemini 3 Pro and then turning on the “Create images” option. Nano Banana Pro: Your new creative partner. Google says the new model can follow complex prompts to create more accurate images. The model is apparently so capable that it can generate an entire usable infographic in a single shot with no weird AI squiggles in place of words. Nano Banana Pro is also better at maintaining consistency in images. You can blend up to 14 images with this tool, and it can maintain the appearance of up to five people in outputs.Read full article Comments",

But an upgrade rolls out today—provided you already have Gemini on your phone, now it can interact with you while you drive. What has sometimes felt like a hands-off approach by Google toward Android Auto didn’t reflect an indifference to making inroads into the automotive world. Apple might have its flashy CarPlay Ultra that lets Cupertino take over the look and feel of a car’s digital UI, but outside of an Aston Martin, where will any of us encounter that? Meanwhile the confusingly similarly named Android Automotive OS—a version of Android developed to run with the kind of stability required in a vehicle as opposed to a handheld—has made solid inroads with automakers, and you’ll find AAOS running in dozens of makes from OEMs like General Motors, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Geely, and more, although not always with the Google Automotive Services—Google Maps, Google Play, and Google Assistant—that impressed us back in 2021 when we drove the original Polestar 2.Read full article Comments",

In the aftermath of the disaster, whale scientist Iain Kerr traveled to the area to study how the spill had affected sperm whales, aiming specialized darts at the animals to collect pencil eraser-sized tissue samples. It wasn’t going well. Each time his boat approached a whale surfacing for air, the animal vanished beneath the waves before he could reach it. “I felt like I was playing Whac-A-Mole,” he says. As darkness fell, a whale dove in front of Kerr and covered him in whale snot. That unpleasant experience gave Kerr, who works at the conservation group Ocean Alliance, an idea: What if he could collect that same snot by somehow flying over the whale? Researchers can glean much information from whale snot, including the animal’s DNA sequence, its sex, whether it is pregnant, and the makeup of its microbiome.Read full article Comments",

While Fahlman describes himself as “the inventor… or at least one of the inventors” of what would later be called the smiley face emoticon, the full story reveals something more interesting than a lone genius moment. The whole episode started three days earlier when computer scientist Neil Swartz posed a physics problem to colleagues on Carnegie Mellon’s “bboard,” which was an early online message board. The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment.

          "content": "Not everyone appreciates the artistry of Jackson Pollock’s famous drip paintings, with some dismissing them as something any child could create. While Pollock’s work is undeniably more sophisticated than that, it turns out that when one looks at splatter paintings made by adults and young children through a fractal lens and compares them to those of Pollock himself, the children’s work does bear a closer resemblance to Pollock’s than those of the adults. This might be due to the artist’s physiology, namely a certain clumsiness with regard to balance, according to a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Physics. Co-author Richard Taylor, a physicist at the University of Oregon, first found evidence of fractal patterns in Pollock’s seemingly random drip patterns in 2001. As previously reported, his original hypothesis drew considerable controversy, both from art historians and a few fellow physicists. In a 2006 paper published in Nature, Case University physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur claimed Taylor’s work was “seriously flawed” and “lacked the range of scales needed to be considered fractal.” (To prove the point, Jones-Smith created her own version of a fractal painting using Taylor’s criteria in about five minutes with Photoshop.) Taylor was particularly criticized for his attempt to use fractal analysis as the basis for an authentication tool to distinguish genuine Pollocks from reproductions or forgeries. He concedes that much of that criticism was valid at the time. But as vindication, he points to a machine learning-based study in 2015 relying on fractal dimension and other factors that achieved a 93 percent accuracy rate distinguishing between genuine Pollocks and non-Pollocks. Taylor built on that work for a 2024 paper reporting 99 percent accuracy.Read full article Comments",

While the N1 isn’t at the top of the charts, Ookla says Apple’s Wi-Fi chip “delivered higher download and upload speeds on Wi-Fi compared to the iPhone 16 across every studied percentile and virtually every region.” The median download speed for the iPhone 17 series was 329.56Mbps, compared to 236.46Mbps for the iPhone 16; the upload speed also jumped from 73.68Mbps to 103.26Mbps.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On a sunny morning on October 19 2025, four men allegedly walked into the world’s most-visited museum and left, minutes later, with crown jewels worth 88 million euros ($101 million). The theft from Paris’ Louvre Museum—one of the world’s most surveilled cultural institutions—took just under eight minutes. Visitors kept browsing. Security didn’t react (until alarms were triggered). The men disappeared into the city’s traffic before anyone realized what had happened. Investigators later revealed that the thieves wore hi-vis vests, disguising themselves as construction workers. They arrived with a furniture lift, a common sight in Paris’s narrow streets, and used it to reach a balcony overlooking the Seine. Dressed as workers, they looked as if they belonged. This strategy worked because we don’t see the world objectively. We see it through categories—through what we expect to see. The thieves understood the social categories that we perceive as “normal” and exploited them to avoid suspicion. Many artificial intelligence (AI) systems work in the same way and are vulnerable to the same kinds of mistakes as a result. The sociologist Erving Goffman would describe what happened at the Louvre using his concept of the presentation of self: people “perform” social roles by adopting the cues others expect. Here, the performance of normality became the perfect camouflage. The sociology of sight Humans carry out mental categorization all the time to make sense of people and places. When something fits the category of “ordinary,” it slips from notice. AI systems used for tasks such as facial recognition and detecting suspicious activity in a public area operate in a similar way. For humans, categorization is cultural. For AI, it is mathematical. But both systems rely on learned patterns rather than objective reality. Because AI learns from data about who looks “normal” and who looks “suspicious,” it absorbs the categories embedded in its training data. And this makes it susceptible to bias. The Louvre robbers weren’t seen as dangerous because they fit a trusted category. In AI, the same process can have the opposite effect: people who don’t fit the statistical norm become more visible and over-scrutinized. It can mean a facial recognition system disproportionately flags certain racial or gendered groups as potential threats while letting others pass unnoticed. A sociological lens helps us see that these aren’t separate issues. AI doesn’t invent its categories; it learns ours. When a computer vision system is trained on security footage where “normal” is defined by particular bodies, clothing, or behavior, it reproduces those assumptions. Just as the museum’s guards looked past the thieves because they appeared to belong, AI can look past certain patterns while overreacting to others. Categorization, whether human or algorithmic, is a double-edged sword. It helps us process information quickly, but it also encodes our cultural assumptions. Both people and machines rely on pattern recognition, which is an efficient but imperfect strategy. A sociological view of AI treats algorithms as mirrors: They reflect back our social categories and hierarchies. In the Louvre case, the mirror is turned toward us. The robbers succeeded not because they were invisible, but because they were seen through the lens of normality. In AI terms, they passed the classification test. From museum halls to machine learning This link between perception and categorization reveals something important about our increasingly algorithmic world. Whether it’s a guard deciding who looks suspicious or an AI deciding who looks like a “shoplifter,” the underlying process is the same: assigning people to categories based on cues that feel objective but are culturally learned. When an AI system is described as “biased,” this often means that it reflects those social categories too faithfully. The Louvre heist reminds us that these categories don’t just shape our attitudes, they shape what gets noticed at all. After the theft, France’s culture minister promised new cameras and tighter security. But no matter how advanced those systems become, they will still rely on categorization. Someone, or something, must decide what counts as “suspicious behavior.” If that decision rests on assumptions, the same blind spots will persist. The Louvre robbery will be remembered as one of Europe’s most spectacular museum thefts. The thieves succeeded because they mastered the sociology of appearance: They understood the categories of normality and used them as tools. And in doing so, they showed how both people and machines can mistake conformity for safety. Their success in broad daylight wasn’t only a triumph of planning. It was a triumph of categorical thinking, the same logic that underlies both human perception and artificial intelligence. The lesson is clear: Before we teach machines to see better, we must first learn to question how we see.

Until recently, they could barely hold their own in high school-level math competitions. But now Google’s DeepMind team has built AlphaProof, an AI system that matched silver medalists’ performance at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, scoring just one point short of gold at the most prestigious undergrad math competition in the world. And that’s kind of a big deal. True understanding The reason computers fared poorly in math competitions is that, while they far surpass humanity’s ability to perform calculations, they are not really that good at the logic and reasoning that is needed for advanced math. Put differently, they are good at performing calculations really quickly, but they usually suck at understanding why they’re doing them. While something like addition seems simple, humans can do semi-formal proofs based on definitions of addition or go for fully formal Peano arithmetic that defines the properties of natural numbers and operations like addition through axioms.Read full article Comments",

I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years.” At Ars, we’ve written at length in recent days about the fears around AI investment. But to Delangue’s point, almost all of those discussions are about companies whose chief product is large language models, or the data centers meant to drive those—specifically, those focused on general-purpose chatbots that are meant to be everything for everybody.Read full article Comments",

Apogee founder Scott Miller first shared the news publicly on social media, and her son William confirmed her death with Ars Technica. Heineman’s GoFundMe page, which displayed a final message she had posted about entering palliative care, will now help her family with funeral costs. Rebecca “Burger Becky” Heineman was born in October 1963 and grew up in Whittier, California. She first gained national recognition in 1980 when she won the national Atari 2600 Space Invaders championship in New York at age 16, becoming the first formally recognized US video game champion. That victory launched a career spanning more than four decades and 67 credited games, according to MobyGames. Among many achievements in her life, Heineman was perhaps best known for co-founding Interplay Productions with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell in 1983. The company created franchises like Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur’s Gate. At Interplay, Heineman designed The Bard’s Tale III: Thief of Fate and Dragon Wars while also programming ports of classics like Wolfenstein 3D and Battle Chess.Read full article Comments",

But the object’s closest approach to the Sun came in late October during the US government shutdown. So, while enough people went to work to ensure that the hardware continued to do its job, nobody was available at NASA to make the images available to the public or discuss their implications. So today, NASA held a press conference to discuss everything that we now know about 3I/ATLAS and how NASA’s hardware contributed to that knowledge. And to say one more time that the object is a fairly typical comet and not some spaceship doing its best to appear like one. Extrasolar comet 3I/ATLAS is an extrasolar comet and the third visitor from another star that we’ve detected. We know the comet part because it looks like one, forming a coma of gas and dust, as well as a tail as the Sun heats up its materials. That hasn’t stopped the usual suspect (Avi Loeb) from speculating that it might be a spacecraft, as he had for the earlier visitors. NASA doesn’t want to hear it. “This object is a comet,” said Associate Administrator Amit Kshatrya. “It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”Read full article Comments",
