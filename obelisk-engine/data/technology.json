          "content": "Tesla is under investigation for failing to report crashes involving its partially autonomous driving technology in a timely manner. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires automakers to report crashes involving advanced driver assist features “within one or five days” of the incident, but Tesla was reporting crashes “several months or more” after they occurred, the agency said. Tesla has told NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation that the delays were the result of a problem with its data collection that has since been fixed. But the agency is still opening an audit investigation as standard procedure to ensure the company is doing everything by the book. The rule dates back to a standing general order (SGO) from 2021 that requires automakers and robotaxi companies to report crashes involving fully autonomous vehicles as well as Level 2 driver-assist systems. Under the SGO, companies are required to document collisions when an automated driving system was in use within 30 seconds of impact and report those incidents to the government. Since it was implemented, Tesla has reported over 2,300 crashes to the federal government, according to NHTSA. An analysis of the crash data shows Tesla accounted for 40 out of 43 fatal crashes reported under the SGO. Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features are considered Level 2 automated technology that requires full driver attention. By comparison, Alphabet’s Waymo uses Level 4 technology that doesn’t require a human driver. Earlier this year, NHTSA proposed revising the SGO to remove some of the reporting requirements.",

But fans of 2017's Hollow Knight managed to make the wait for Silksong into a meme.

The findings challenge conventional interpretations of prehistoric violence as bring indiscriminate or committed for pragmatic reasons. Neolithic Europe was no stranger to collective violence of many forms, such as the odd execution and massacres of small communities, as well as armed conflicts. For instance, we recently reported on an analysis of human remains from 11 individuals recovered from El Mirador Cave in Spain, showing evidence of cannibalism—likely the result of a violent episode between competing Late Neolithic herding communities about 5,700 years ago. Microscopy analysis revealed telltale slice marks, scrape marks, and chop marks, as well as evidence of cremation, peeling, fractures, and human tooth marks. This indicates the victims were skinned, the flesh removed, the bodies disarticulated, and then cooked and eaten. Isotope analysis indicated the individuals were local and were probably eaten over the course of just a few days. There have been similar Neolithic massacres in Germany and Spain, but the El Mirador remains provide evidence of a rare systematic consumption of victims.Read full article Comments",

When the Trump administration announced its overhaul of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in March, estimates published by The Wall Street Journal suggested that SpaceX could receive $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules. Musk clearly expected a big windfall; as we've written, SpaceX alleges that Virginia and Louisiana violated the Trump administration's rules by allocating most of the money to fiber providers instead of Starlink's satellite service. Assuming Virginia and Louisiana don't back down, SpaceX has indicated it will ask the Trump administration to reject their grant proposals. SpaceX might end up filing similar objections in many other states after more of them reveal their plans. A third state, West Virginia, revealed its plan on Tuesday, and SpaceX isn't likely to be happy with it.Read full article Comments",

In a statement Thursday flagged by Bloomberg, Australia's main financial services union, the Finance Sector Union (FSU), claimed a \"massive win\" for 45 union members whom the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) had replaced with an AI-powered \"voice bot.\" The FSU noted that some of these workers had been with CBA for decades. Those workers in particular were shocked when CBA announced last month that their jobs had become redundant. At that time, CBA claimed that launching the chatbot supposedly \"led to a reduction in call volumes\" by 2,000 a week, FSU said.Read full article Comments",

Driving down the pocked and barren two-lane road to its sandy terminus, I found only rolling dunes, a large mound of dirt, and a few satellite dishes that talked to Dragon spacecraft as they flew overhead. A few years later, in mid-2019, the company had moved some of that dirt and built a small launch pad. A handful of SpaceX engineers working there at the time shared some office space nearby in a tech hub building, \"Stargate.\" The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley proudly opened this state-of-the-art technology center just weeks earlier. That summer, from Stargate's second floor, engineers looked on as the Starhopper prototype made its first two flights a couple of miles away. Over the ensuing years, as the company began assembling its Starship rockets on site, SpaceX first erected small tents, then much larger tents, and then towering high bays in which the vehicles were stacked. Starbase grew and evolved to meet the company's needs.Read full article Comments",

Other systems are better thought of as convenience features—things like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, which relieve some of the burden of driving. Among the newer of these is the traffic jam assist. It's a variant of adaptive cruise plus lane keeping designed for low-speed stop-start driving on limited-access highways, usually cutting out around 40 mph. But we're still talking about a so-called \"level 2\" system, where the human driver is responsible for maintaining situational awareness; even more advanced \"level 3\" assists exist—these allow the driver to completely disengage from the task—but are not the topic for today. AAA recently put five (unnamed) ADAS systems to the test in the Los Angeles area, blessed as it is with dependable heavy freeway traffic. The testers went out together in morning and afternoon weekday traffic, covering the same routes simultaneously. The vehicles were driven an average of 342 miles (550 km) over 16.2 hours, with the ADAS operated according to each vehicle's user manual. And the cars were instrumented with cameras and GPS to record traffic conditions, behavior, and so on.Read full article Comments",

The sterile IV solutions produced in the plant are essential supplies for hospitals and other medical facilities, which use them in various treatments, from rehydration to drug delivery and kidney dialysis. And the plant damaged by Helene—Baxter International's North Cove manufacturing facility in Marion—didn't just make some of the US supply; it made 60 percent. With the Baxter plant down, hospitals around the country began rationing supplies. They changed treatment strategies and, in some cases, canceled or delayed surgeries. In one poll, over 86 percent of health care providers said they were affected by the nationwide shortage. The federal government, for its part, loosened importation rules and granted extensions to expiration dates to offer some relief from the dire shortage. This secondary emergency was yet another reminder of just how fragile the US drug supply chain has become. Just months before the catastrophic hurricane in North Carolina, drug shortages in the US reached an all-time high, with 323 active and ongoing shortages. Although they've fallen since then, they remain high, with shortages in the first quarter of this year at 253, according to data collected by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Read full article Comments",

An Xbox-branded extension of Asus' existing ROG Ally handheld line, the basic ROG Xbox Ally and more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X, both run a version of Windows 11 Home that's been redesigned with a controller-first Xbox-style user interface. The idea is to preserve the wide game compatibility of Windows—and the wide compatibility with multiple storefronts, including Microsoft's own, Valve's Steam, the Epic Games Store, and more—while turning off all of the extra Windows desktop stuff and saving system resources. (This also means that, despite the Xbox branding, these handhelds play Windows PC games and not the Xbox versions.) Microsoft and Asus initially announced the handhelds in June. Microsoft still isn't sharing pricing information for either console, so it's hard to say how their specs and features will stack up against the Steam Deck (starting at $399 for the LCD version, $549 for OLED), Nintendo's Switch 2 ($450), or past Asus handhelds like the ROG Ally X ($800).Read full article Comments",

Yet over the past 66 million years, mammals across the globe have repeatedly gone down this path—not once or twice, but at least a dozen times. From anteaters and aardvarks to pangolins and aardwolves, the so-called myrmecophages (animals that feed on ants and termites) have evolved similar traits: they’ve lost most or all of their teeth, grown long sticky tongues, and learned to consume insects by the tens to hundreds of thousands each day. A new study reveals that this extreme dietary specialization, once thought rare and mysterious, has emerged independently in mammals at least 12 times in the last 66 million years (i.e., since the Cenozoic era began). This is a striking example of convergent evolution and shows just how powerful ants and termites have been in shaping mammalian history. “The number of distinct origins for myrmecophagy was certainly surprising, as was the discovery that their origins seem to quite neatly follow the trend of growth across ant and termite colony sizes throughout the Cenozoic,” Thomas Vida, first author of the study and a researcher at the University of Bonn, told Ars Technica.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "After the Trump administration confirmed a rumor that the US is planning to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel, US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came forward Wednesday to voice support for the highly unusual plan, finding rare common ground with Donald Trump. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the plan would see the US disbursing approved CHIPS Act grants only after acquiring non-voting shares of Intel and likely other chipmakers. That would allow the US to profit off its investment in chipmakers, Lutnick suggested, and Sanders told Reuters that he agreed American taxpayers could benefit from the potential deals. \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment,\" Sanders said.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When updating a piece of software as large and complex and old as Windows, you're inevitably going to break something every once in a while. Microsoft tracks known issues here—generally they affect lesser-used features or obscure edge cases, but every once in a while you run into something bigger and more disruptive. August's updates have introduced a couple of more noticeable problems. The first was caused by update KB5063875, a relatively minor security update for older versions of Windows 10 and 11. This update broke Windows' built-in reset and recovery features, used to restore a Windows installation to its factory defaults if you're experiencing a problem or are planning on handing down or otherwise getting rid of your PC. After installing the update, users of Windows 11 23H2 and 22H2 and Windows 10 22H2 who tried to reset their PCs would see the process silently fail with no explanation. Microsoft quickly resolved this one with update KB5066189—the issue was opened on August 18 and marked as resolved on August 19—so if you're still having issues, check for the update that will fix your update.Read full article Comments",

China has disclosed little information about the Guowang network, but there's mounting evidence that the satellites may provide Chinese military forces a tactical edge in any future armed conflict in the Western Pacific. The megaconstellation is managed by a secretive company called China SatNet, which was established by the Chinese government in 2021. SatNet has released little information since its formation, and the group doesn't have a website. Chinese officials have not detailed any of the satellites' capabilities or signaled any intention to market the services to consumers.Read full article Comments",

The AAP has been among the most assertive medical groups to push back on the anti-vaccine tactics and actions Kennedy has undertaken as the country's top health official. Those include spreading misinformation about lifesaving vaccines; firing all 17 esteemed CDC vaccine advisors under the false pretense that they had disqualifying conflicts of interest; replacing those advisors with unqualified committee members who share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views; and unilaterally restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines without any evidence-based explanation. Prior to the release of the vaccine schedule, the AAP boycotted the first meeting of Kennedy's hand-selected CDC vaccine advisors in June, saying the committee's work is \"no longer a credible process.\" In July, the organization filed a lawsuit—alongside other medical groups—against the US health department over Kennedy's changes to the federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.Read full article Comments",

But the orange-yellow stains on the lab coats slung on hooks hint at a less-usual subject matter under study. The powdery stain is pollen: microscopic grains containing male reproductive cells that trees, weeds, and grasses release seasonally. But Cho isn’t studying irksome effects like hay fever, or what pollen means for the plants that make it. Instead, the material scientist has spent a decade pioneering and refining techniques to remodel pollen’s rigid outer shell—made of a polymer so tough it’s sometimes called “the diamond of the plant world”—transforming the grains to a jam-like consistency. This microgel, Cho believes, could be a versatile building block for many eco-friendly materials, including paper, film, and sponges.Read full article Comments",

In our 2024 year-end roundup, Ars senior editor Samuel Axon wrote that the first season gave us \"a specific cocktail of tongue-in-cheek humor, sci-fi campiness, strong themes, great characters, and visceral violence [that] came together into a fantastic show.\" The second season looks like it will bring us more of the same, along with a major new character drawn from the Fallout: New Vegas game. We even got a glimpse of a Deathclaw. (Minor spoilers for S1 below.) For the uninitiated, Fallout is set two centuries after nuclear warfare between the US and China destroyed civilization in 2077—an alternate history version of 2077, in which post-World War II nuclear technology ushered in a retrofuturistic society. Some lucky survivors took refuge in various underground vaults; others were left to scavenge a meager existence on the highly radioactive surface.Read full article Comments",
