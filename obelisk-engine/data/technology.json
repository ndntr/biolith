          "content": "Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella (L), speaks with OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, who joined by video during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington on May 19, 2025. As OpenAI attempts to restructure itself and eventually go public, a hurdle for the startup, recently valued at $500 billion, is its increasingly complicated partnership with Microsoft. On Thursday afternoon, the two companies released this joint statement about an agreement they’ve reached. Microsoft & OpenAI: Microsoft and OpenAI have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership. We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety. Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019, and shares in the revenue earned by ChatGPT as well as its API. Microsoft also now includes OpenAI as a competitor, allows OpenAI to lean on other cloud providers for compute power, and has started to increase its reliance on its own AI models. In a company town hall meeting on Thursday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and AI chief Mustafa Suleyman committed to “significant investments” in its own models. “We should have the capacity to build world class frontier models in house of all sizes, but we should be very pragmatic and use other models where we need to,” said Suleyman. There was one specific detail about the agreement with Microsoft released by OpenAI in another statement, saying that its nonprofit parent company will continue to hold authority over the for-profit business, with an equity stake worth more than $100 billion. Other philanthropies and nonprofits have reportedly pushed back against OpenAI’s unusual restructuring plan, and the attorneys general of California and Delaware have opened investigations. In its announcement, OpenAI said, “We continue to work with the California and Delaware Attorneys General as an important part of strengthening our approach, and we remain committed to learning and acting with urgency to ensure our tools are helpful and safe for everyone, while advancing safety as an industry-wide priority.”",

The Hollywood Reporter quoted Zaslav as saying: The fact that this is quality—and that’s true across our company, motion picture, TV production [and] streaming quality—we all ... think that gives us a chance to raise price. We think we’re way underpriced. Today, HBO Max starts at $10 per month with ads, $17/month for no ads, and $21/month for no ads and premium features (4K streaming, Dolby Atmos, and the ability to stream from more devices simultaneously and perform more downloads). The streaming platform has raised prices twice since launching (as Max) in May 2023. In June 2024, the Standard, ad-free plan went from $16/month to $17/month, and annual subscription fees went up by $20 or $10, depending on the plan.

The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is given between 12 and 15 months. \"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,\" Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. \"Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity.

The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. The findings were intriguing, but not conclusive. Further study of the rocks in an advanced lab on Earth might prove more definitive. Duffy was ready, he said, to discuss the scientific results along with NASA experts on the call with reporters. However, the very first question—and for any space reporter, the obvious one—concerned NASA's on-again, off-again plan to return rocks from the surface of Mars for study on Earth. This mission, called Mars Sample Return, has been on hold for nearly two years after an independent analysis found that NASA's bloated plan would cost at least $8 billion to $11 billion. President Trump has sought to cancel it outright.Read full article Comments",

Unsurprisingly, the framework requires blocking \"burdensome\" state AI regulations, as well as foreign ones. Cruz unsuccessfully helped push for a similar decadelong moratorium on state AI laws as part of Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget bill.

So if two black holes combine, the newly formed black hole will have a larger surface area. This became known as Hawking's area theorem. Analysis of the gravitational signal from a black hole merger detected in January provides the best observational evidence to date in support of Hawking's theorem, according to a new paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters. The breakthrough just happens to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the LIGO collaboration's Nobel Prize-winning first detection of a black hole merger. A second paper has been submitted (but not yet accepted), placing theoretical limits on a predicted third tone at a higher pitch that could be lurking in the event's gravitational wave signal. Now known as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), the collaboration searches the Universe for gravitational waves produced by the mergers of black holes and neutron stars. LIGO detects gravitational waves via laser interferometry, using high-powered lasers to measure tiny changes in the distance between two objects positioned kilometers apart. LIGO has detectors in Hanford, Washington, and in Livingston, Louisiana. A third detector in Italy, Advanced Virgo, came online in 2016. In Japan, KAGRA is the first gravitational-wave detector in Asia and the first to be built underground. Construction began on LIGO-India in 2021, and physicists expect it will turn on sometime after 2025.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "VMware will lose a significant chunk of business over the next three years, according to Gartner research VP Julia Palmer. Of course, some organizations have already abandoned VMware or are plotting partial or total migrations. Broadcom acquired the virtualization business in November 2023 and made sweeping changes that alienated many customers. The biggest concerns have been higher costs driven by a shift from perpetual licenses to subscriptions and the bundling of products into fewer, more expensive SKUs and a reduction in the number of channel partners that are allowed to resell VMware technologies. The new VMware business model favors large organizations, forcing many small- to medium-sized businesses to explore alternatives. However, the wave of departures that Palmer spoke of today at Gartner’s IT Symposium in Gold Coast, Australia, comes from customers who use VMware technology through hyperscalers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), as reported by The Register. Soon after its acquisition, Broadcom made it so that hyperscalers are unable to resell VMware subscriptions to customers using hyperscaler cloud services that rely on VMware. Because of this change, 35 percent of VMware workloads will migrate elsewhere by 2028, Palmer predicted, noting that hyperscalers will push their customers to the public cloud.Read full article Comments",

Purchases will be available in the navigation list alongside all the other stock Gmail labels.

Services will be restored as soon as possible.\" As of press time, the services appear to be restored. The disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. \"Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow,\" joked one Hacker News commenter. Another user recalled a joke from a previous AI outage: \"Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024.\" The most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user observed: \"It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages.\" Another user also noted this pattern, saying that \"early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "For millions of Spotify users, the \"Wrapped\" feature—which crunches the numbers on their annual listening habits—is a highlight of every year's end, ever since it debuted in 2015. NPR once broke down exactly why our brains find the feature so \"irresistible,\" while Cosmopolitan last year declared that sharing Wrapped screenshots of top artists and songs had by now become \"the ultimate status symbol\" for tens of millions of music fans. It's no surprise then that, after a decade, some Spotify users who are especially eager to see Wrapped evolve are no longer willing to wait to see if Spotify will ever deliver the more creative streaming insights they crave. With the help of AI, these users expect that their data can be more quickly analyzed to potentially uncover overlooked or never-considered patterns that could offer even more insights into what their listening habits say about them.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "As part of its unprovoked invasion, Russia has been firing massed waves of drones and missiles into Ukraine for years, though the tempo has been raised dramatically in recent months. Barrages of 700-plus drones now regularly attack Ukraine during overnight raids. Russia also appears to have upped the ante dramatically by sending at least 19 drones into Poland last night, some of which were shot down by NATO forces. Many of these drones are Shahed/Geran types built with technology imported from Iran, and they have recently gained the ability to fly higher, making shootdowns more difficult. Given the low cost of the drones (estimates suggest they cost a few tens of thousands of dollars apiece, and many are simply decoys without warheads), hitting them with multimillion-dollar missiles from traditional air-defense batteries makes little sense and would quickly exhaust missile stocks. So Ukraine has adopted widespread electronic warfare to disrupt control systems and navigation. Drones not forced off their path are fought with mobile anti-aircraft guns, aircraft, and interceptor drones, many launched from mobile fire teams patrolling Ukraine during the night.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr. In a hearing last Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee, a combative Kennedy repeatedly called Monarez a liar and made the incredible claim that he fired her after he asked her directly if she was a trustworthy person and she responded \"no.\" While senators clearly struggled to believe that explanation, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) wryly noted that Kennedy should have asked her the question before having the Senate confirm her for the role. In an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal the same day as Kennedy's testimony, Monarez gave a different account of her firing—one corroborated by independent reporting—saying that she was ousted after she refused Kennedy's directives to fire senior CDC staff and pre-approve vaccine recommendations from an advisory committee he had stacked with fellow anti-vaccine advocates.Read full article Comments",

Trump's Commerce Department rewrote the rules of the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program, forcing states to change how they spend money earmarked for expanding broadband access. The overhaul led states to reduce spending on fiber networks and increase spending on satellite—although not to the extent sought by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who is demanding more money for his Starlink network. Since states are spending less on deployment, and the program still has the $42 billion allocated by Congress, what happens to the leftover amount after money is spent on deploying broadband networks? Amid speculation that the Trump administration wants to return that money to the US Treasury, Louisiana's Republican governor is worried that states won't be able to use the full $42 billion. It's possible that half or more of the $42 billion won't be used to expand broadband.Read full article Comments",
