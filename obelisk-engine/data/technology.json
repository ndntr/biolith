Users weren’t able to access X, ChatGPT, and even the outage-tracking site DownDetector on Tuesday morning, with some sites displaying an error message that said, “Please unblock challenges.cloudflare.com to proceed.” The disruption, which started at around 6:20AM ET, is linked to a “configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic,” Cloudflare spokesperson Jackie Dutton tells The Verge. “The file grew beyond an expected size of entries and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare&#8217;s services.” Dutton added that “there is no evidence” of an attack or other malicious activity. Cloudflare posted an update to its status page at 9:42AM ET, saying: “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.” Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht wrote in a post on X that the service “failed” its customers and the broader internet, adding that “a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made… This was not an attack.” I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in @Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us.

The Cloudflare outage comes less than a month after a huge Amazon Web Services crash took down Fortnite, Alexa, Snapchat, and other services, which was followed by issues at Microsoft Azure that brought Xbox offline for hours.

In a Tuesday ruling, US District Judge James Boasberg said the FTC failed to show that Meta has a monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.” In that narrowly defined market, the FTC unsuccessfully argued, Meta supposedly faces only two rivals, Snapchat and MeWe, which struggle to compete due to its alleged monopoly. But the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over, Boasberg wrote. He cited the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who “posited that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” while telling the FTC they missed their chance to block Meta’s purchase.Read full article Comments",

          "standfirst": "November has turned into Black Friday and vice versa. What was once a one-day shopping sprint has turned into a month-long marathon, with retailers rolling out discounts week after week. Thanks to this, it can be easy to get deal fatigue after a while — but no one wants to miss out on a good discount, regardless of if you’re buying for yourself or someone else. We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go portable speaker for $25 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of the best portable speakers out there right now, the Select 4 Go is made even better by its affordable price. It has good sound quality for its size and can get pretty loud, filling a small room easily. You can also pair two together for stereo sound, and its battery will last up to 20 hours on a single charge. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals iRobot Roomba 104 Vac Robot Vacuum for $150 (40 percent off): This is an updated version of our favorite budget robot vacuum and it will make an excellent choice for anyone who has never used one of these devices before, or a gift for a new homeowner. Not only is the iRobot mobile app super easy to use, but this machine has strong suction power and good battery life, plus it will automatically return to its docking station when it needs a power-up. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599. More Black Friday tech deals Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $92 (32 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best power banks, this Anker brick is kind of a one-and-done device. It has enough capacity to charge all sorts of devices from smartphones to laptops to handheld gaming consoles, and it has two built-in USB-C cables so you don't even have to remember to bring your own to use it. Also available at Anker. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a PlayStation 5, these Black Friday deals are worth noting. Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board starting November 21, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. Those are some of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. Also starting November 21, the DualSense Wireless Controller will be down to $60, a $20 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $170 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $180.

          "title": "Musk's xAI launches Grok 4.1 with lower hallucination rate on the web and apps — no API access (for now)",
          "standfirst": "In what appeared to be a bid to soak up some of Google&#x27;s limelight prior to the launch of its new Gemini 3 flagship AI model — now recorded as the most powerful LLM in the world by multiple independent evaluators — Elon Musk&#x27;s rival AI startup xAI last night unveiled its newest large language model, Grok 4.1.The model is now live for consumer use on Grok.com, social network X (formerly Twitter), and the company’s iOS and Android mobile apps, and it arrives with major architectural and usability enhancements, among them: faster reasoning, improved emotional intelligence, and significantly reduced hallucination rates. xAI also commendably published a white paper on its evaluations and including a small bit on training process here. Across public benchmarks, Grok 4.1 has vaulted to the top of the leaderboard, outperforming rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google — at least, Google&#x27;s pre-Gemini 3 model (Gemini 2.5 Pro). It builds upon the success of xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 Fast, which VentureBeat covered favorably shortly following its release back in September 2025.However, enterprise developers looking to integrate the new and improved model Grok 4.1 into production environments will find one major constraint: it&#x27;s not yet available through xAI’s public API. Despite its high benchmarks, Grok 4.1 remains confined to xAI’s consumer-facing interfaces, with no announced timeline for API exposure. At present, only older models—including Grok 4 Fast (reasoning and non-reasoning variants), Grok 4 0709, and legacy models such as Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, and Grok 2 Vision—are available for programmatic use via the xAI developer API. These support up to 2 million tokens of context, with token pricing ranging from $0.20 to $3.00 per million depending on the configuration.For now, this limits Grok 4.1’s utility in enterprise workflows that rely on backend integration, fine-tuned agentic pipelines, or scalable internal tooling. While the consumer rollout positions Grok 4.1 as the most capable LLM in xAI’s portfolio, production deployments in enterprise environments remain on hold.Model Design and Deployment StrategyGrok 4.1 arrives in two configurations: a fast-response, low-latency mode for immediate replies, and a “thinking” mode that engages in multi-step reasoning before producing output. Both versions are live for end users and are selectable via the model picker in xAI’s apps.The two configurations differ not just in latency but also in how deeply the model processes prompts. Grok 4.1 Thinking leverages internal planning and deliberation mechanisms, while the standard version prioritizes speed. Despite the difference in architecture, both scored higher than any competing models in blind preference and benchmark testing.Leading the Field in Human and Expert EvaluationOn the LMArena Text Arena leaderboard, Grok 4.1 Thinking briefly held the top position with a normalized Elo score of 1483 — then was dethroned a few hours later with Google&#x27;s release of Gemini 3 and its incredible 1501 Elo score. The non-thinking version of Grok 4.1 also fares well on the index, however, at 1465. These scores place Grok 4.1 above Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 series, and OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 preview.In creative writing, Grok 4.1 ranks second only to Polaris Alpha (an early GPT-5.1 variant), with the “thinking” model earning a score of 1721.9 on the Creative Writing v3 benchmark. This marks a roughly 600-point improvement over previous Grok iterations. Similarly, in the Arena Expert leaderboard, which aggregates feedback from professional reviewers, Grok 4.1 Thinking again leads the field with a score of 1510.The gains are especially notable given that Grok 4.1 was released only two months after Grok 4 Fast, highlighting the accelerated development pace at xAI.Core Improvements Over Previous GenerationsTechnically, Grok 4.1 represents a significant leap in real-world usability. Visual capabilities—previously limited in Grok 4—have been upgraded to enable robust image and video understanding, including chart analysis and OCR-level text extraction. Multimodal reliability was a pain point in prior versions and has now been addressed.Token-level latency has been reduced by approximately 28 percent while preserving reasoning depth. In long-context tasks, Grok 4.1 maintains coherent output up to 1 million tokens, improving on Grok 4’s tendency to degrade past the 300,000 token mark.xAI has also improved the model&#x27;s tool orchestration capabilities. Grok 4.1 can now plan and execute multiple external tools in parallel, reducing the number of interaction cycles required to complete multi-step queries. According to internal test logs, some research tasks that previously required four steps can now be completed in one or two.Other alignment improvements include better truth calibration—reducing the tendency to hedge or soften politically sensitive outputs—and more natural, human-like prosody in voice mode, with support for different speaking styles and accents.Safety and Adversarial RobustnessAs part of its risk management framework, xAI evaluated Grok 4.1 for refusal behavior, hallucination resistance, sycophancy, and dual-use safety.The hallucination rate in non-reasoning mode has dropped from 12.09 percent in Grok 4 Fast to just 4.22 percent — a roughly 65% improvement.The model also scored 2.97 percent on FActScore, a factual QA benchmark, down from 9.89 percent in earlier versions.In the domain of adversarial robustness, Grok 4.1 has been tested with prompt injection attacks, jailbreak prompts, and sensitive chemistry and biology queries. Safety filters showed low false negative rates, especially for restricted chemical knowledge (0.00 percent) and restricted biological queries (0.03 percent). The model’s ability to resist manipulation in persuasion benchmarks, such as MakeMeSay, also appears strong—it registered a 0 percent success rate as an attacker.Limited Enterprise Access via APIDespite these gains, Grok 4.1 remains unavailable to enterprise users through xAI’s API. According to the company’s public documentation, the latest available models for developers are Grok 4 Fast (both reasoning and non-reasoning variants), each supporting up to 2 million tokens of context at pricing tiers ranging from $0.20 to $0.50 per million tokens. These are backed by a 4M tokens-per-minute throughput limit and 480 requests per minute (RPM) rate cap.By contrast, Grok 4.1 is accessible only through xAI’s consumer-facing properties—X, Grok.com, and the mobile apps. This means organizations cannot yet deploy Grok 4.1 via fine-tuned internal workflows, multi-agent chains, or real-time product integrations.Industry Reception and Next StepsThe release has been met with strong public and industry feedback. Elon Musk, founder of xAI, posted a brief endorsement, calling it “a great model” and congratulating the team. AI benchmark platforms have praised the leap in usability and linguistic nuance.For enterprise customers, however, the picture is more mixed. Grok 4.1’s performance represents a breakthrough for general-purpose and creative tasks, but until API access is enabled, it will remain a consumer-first product with limited enterprise applicability.As competitive models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic continue to evolve, xAI’s next strategic move may hinge on when—and how—it opens Grok 4.1 to external developers.",

          "standfirst": "You don’t have to spend a ton to get your hands on quality tech, thanks to Black Friday. We’re already seeing lots of tech deals — many for under $50 and some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year. Many of the discounts apply to accessories — the chargers, hubs, cables and drives that play supporting roles for smartphones and laptops — but plenty of other small electronics are on sale, too. We rounded up smart speakers, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers that are seeing notable discounts. It's all things Engadget recommends in our guides and elsewhere — and we linked to our coverage so you can read up before you buy. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals we could find. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh. For just $13. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $20 ($7 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off our outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $24 ($11 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $26 ($7 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and others is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity among smart plugs. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Primea) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $36 ($55 off) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $40 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $45 ($11 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $50 ($20 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap) and goes for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40 meter Bluetooth range. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $50 ($20 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy an auto-applied code.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-already-live-anker-chargers-apple-airtags-blink-cameras-legos-and-more-173833576.html?src=rss",
          "content": "You don’t have to spend a ton to get your hands on quality tech, thanks to Black Friday. We’re already seeing lots of tech deals — many for under $50 and some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year. Many of the discounts apply to accessories — the chargers, hubs, cables and drives that play supporting roles for smartphones and laptops — but plenty of other small electronics are on sale, too. We rounded up smart speakers, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers that are seeing notable discounts. It's all things Engadget recommends in our guides and elsewhere — and we linked to our coverage so you can read up before you buy. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals we could find. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh. For just $13. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $20 ($7 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off our outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $24 ($11 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $26 ($7 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and others is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity among smart plugs. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Primea) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $36 ($55 off) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $40 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $45 ($11 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $50 ($20 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide.

This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap) and goes for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40 meter Bluetooth range.

We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is nearly here but, in good news for anyone who wants to stock up on tech accessories, a whole slew of Anker gear is already on sale. If you’re familiar with the brand, you know it makes some of the most reliable charging gear out there. If you’re new to Anker, you’re in for a treat. Anker gear ranks among the top brands we’ve tested, which is why you’ll find it in our guides to MagSafe power banks, wireless charging stations and more. So if you want to get a jump on Black Friday and score deals on hardworking peripherals right now, check out the best Black Friday Anker deals below. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and let you play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to the wall. Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the slickest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, some of our favorite Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. With Black Friday deals, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s long enough and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that continually show up in our guides to the best accessories. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that don't quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for Black Friday. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in our review, now for less. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

          "title": "What is a VPN and what can you do with one?",
          "standfirst": "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool you can use to protect your identity online, change your virtual location, evade censorship, check out foreign streaming services and more. They mostly take the form of commercially available subscription apps, often so simple to operate that all you need to do is press a button to turn them on and off. While using a VPN is easy in practice, there's a lot going on under the hood. Knowing what's really happening can help you decide which VPN is right for you, then use it more effectively once you've got it. In this guide, I'm going to delve into what a VPN really is, how it works and what you might need one for. If this article convinces you that you need a VPN — and I hope it does! — I curate a collection of the best VPN deals that I update at least once a week. Head over there to get your VPN shopping started. What is a VPN? The name \"virtual private network\" comes from the initial use of the technology to access restricted networks from off-site — if you work remotely, you probably still use a VPN this way. Those are corporate VPNs, though, from providers like Cisco. Here, we're talking about commercial VPNs sold for individual use. These services came about when people realized that if you connected to the public internet through a VPN, every server you contacted would see the VPN server instead of your personal computer. The VPN effectively becomes a mask that interacts with the web on your behalf. That's the simple principle underlying every commercial VPN you've seen advertised. Sam Chapman for Engadget VPNs like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN operate servers in various locations around the world. When you use their apps, you've got access to all the servers in their network. After you connect, communications between your device and your chosen server are encrypted so nobody can trace your activities back to you. This is called tunneling, and is the main difference between a full VPN and a simple proxy server. How does a VPN work? Questions like the above can get into the weeds fast, so I'll be oversimplifying here. VPNs handle encryption in two steps. First, they establish a secure tunnel to your computer or phone, then they send information through it. The first step — establishing the connection — is called a handshake. It uses asymmetric encryption, where each party has a public and a private key. In a handshake, two parties use public keys to confirm that they are who they say they are, then exchange the keys they'll use for simpler symmetric encryption. Sam Chapman for Engadget Once the handshake has confirmed the path between your device and the VPN server, the tunnel is complete. From then on until you disconnect, every packet of data you send will be encrypted before it leaves your device and not decrypted until it reaches the VPN. The same is true in the other direction. Website requests and other data sent between the VPN and your internet service provider (ISP) will not be encrypted, but that's OK — without the information on the first step, it's impossible to identify you behind the VPN. This is a complicated process, but VPNs use sets of instructions called VPN protocols to run through it near-instantly. A VPN protocol covers encryption and transit using several sets of ciphers. The most common protocols these days are OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2/IPSec, though many VPN services have their own proprietary protocols as selling points. What are the benefits of using a VPN? Although the above process happens mostly in the background, it does tax your internet connection a little. The best VPNs keep impacts to a minimum, but you may notice a drop in speed, plus higher latencies when connecting to servers far away. So, what benefits do you get in exchange for all that? Anonymity The first and biggest boon is near-total anonymity. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) put out a comprehensive report on everything your ISP knows about you — confirming that nearly every ISP gets a second profit stream from selling information on your online activities. In essence, they're making you pay them for the right to hose your own privacy. But a VPN lets you strike back. Since you connect to the VPN server before your ISP ever clocks you (let alone your destination websites), your computer and modem broadcast no information about who you really are. Anyone can see what you're doing, but they'll only see the VPN server doing it. And hiding your IP address is vital — lots of people (not just ISPs) can deduce a shocking amount about you with no other information, including your real location. Prevent ISP speed throttling Speed isn't normally one of the benefits of a VPN, but in some specific cases, you might get faster internet. ISPs occasionally throttle the speeds of certain users they perceive as using too much bandwidth. This can happen to you, whether or not the charge is accurate. Using a VPN can get around the slowdown, since the ISP can't identify you to throttle you. Just note you still can't go faster than your unprotected internet speed. Public Wi-Fi safety A VPN can also keep you safe when using public Wi-Fi. On an unsecured Wi-Fi network — the sort you often find in cafes, hotel lobbies and other public buildings — hackers can spy on you through various vulnerabilities, or even set up fake networks (called \"rogue hotspots\") to capture your information. If your connection with the network is encrypted, the criminal's window of opportunity slams shut. Get around content blocks and firewalls The other most important thing a VPN can do is to change your virtual location. IP addresses are keyed to specific locations — some to countries or regions, and some to networks as small as one building. Authorities can use this to restrict internet access on the networks they control. This can vary in scale, from your school or workplace blocking certain content, all the way up to the nation-level firewalls in China, Saudi Arabia and other countries. Remember, though, that your internet goes to the VPN before it goes anywhere else. If your school's internet blocks some sites, you could get on a VPN server and the school's firewall won't know you're connecting from inside. This even works with countries (though not always). By connecting to a server outside the sphere of oppression, you can organize activism online even when the government doesn't want you to. Sam Chapman for Engadget Of course, you can also use this trick for fun by checking out other countries' streaming libraries, viewing local exclusive events or protecting you while you download a torrent file. The key takeaway is that VPNs are versatile, and can be used for casual entertainment, life-and-death anonymity or both at once. Will a VPN keep me completely safe online? VPNs are a huge positive for individual privacy rights, but just having one doesn't mean you can ignore your online safety. It's better to think of VPNs as one part of a comprehensive strategy. A VPN keeps you anonymous, prevents you from being tracked and changes your location to bypass censorship. However, it can't directly protect you from downloading malware, falling for a phishing scam, oversharing information on social media, using an easily guessed password or getting your phone stolen in real life. There's one key difference between threats a VPN can prevent and those it can't: A VPN only protects you from being spied on without your consent. If all you're doing is browsing on a network, a VPN keeps you concealed. But today's malefactors have all sorts of tricks to get you to give your consent. Websites spam message windows until you click \"allow cookies.\" Hackers send phishing emails and make you click links that download malware. And so on. Can VPNs be trusted? There's also one other critical point. Even if a VPN keeps you completely anonymous, the VPN itself can still tie your identity to what you do online. That's why VPNs all claim to have \"strict no-logging policies\" or something similar — they're promising not to abuse their access. Naturally, some do anyway. A VPN can be sued if it breaks its own privacy policy, but many escape liability by leaving just enough leeway that they technically aren't in violation. The best way to determine if you can trust a VPN is to look at its history. How long has it been operating? Has it ever mishandled or profited off customer data in that time? On the other hand, has it ever been raided by police who then found nothing, bolstering its claim to not keep logs? An excerpt from the privacy policy of Private Internet Access. Sam Chapman for Engadget Some of the most trustworthy VPNs take technical steps to guarantee that they aren't logging user activity. Many use RAM-only or diskless servers that automatically delete any logs. Proton VPN goes even farther, using full-disk encryption to render any logs unreadable (even if they did exist). These services back their claims up with independent audits from reliable firms. Bottom line: A VPN is no substitute for common sense, threat awareness and a suite of strong security tools. It'll work best alongside a password manager, virus scanner and two-factor authentication. Are VPNs legal? VPNs are legal in every free country on Earth. While the UK recently suggested that a VPN ban was \"on the table\" to enforce its age verification laws, and the US states of Wisconsin and Michigan are considering bans in various forms, no democracy has yet outlawed VPN usage. The countries that do ban VPNs are the ones you'd probably expect — those with deep-rooted internet censorship regimes that VPN use might threaten. Belarus, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea and Turkmenistan have made all VPNs illegal. In China, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Uganda and Iran, only state-approved VPNs are permitted, and services that get approved tend to have government backdoors. Other countries heavily restrict VPNs without banning them altogether, including Turkey and Pakistan. In India, VPNs are legal, but the law requires them to keep logs of user activities. The law's passage in 2022 led many VPNs to pull their servers from India and replace them with virtual locations. Finally, there are countries like Egypt where using a VPN is legal, but you'll face extra penalties if you're caught using one to commit a crime. Also, it should go without saying, but VPNs don't make crime legal. If something is illegal without a VPN, it's illegal with a VPN, even if VPNs themselves are allowed in your state and country. Are VPNs free? Some of them are, but many of them are dangerous. If you've just been faced with a new threat to your online freedom — like, say, the UK's new age restriction laws — it can be tempting to jump to a free VPN to solve the problem quickly. But free VPNs are easy to hack together, and app stores rarely probe them for violations before listing them. I frequently see free VPNs that either don't work, track you for ad sales or even sneak malware onto your computer. Another big problem is that many of these shovelware VPNs are all secretly run by the same monolithic entities. Sam Chapman for Engadget The best free VPNs are free plans offered by paid services. With subscription fees supporting the free tier, you don't need to worry that the real money comes from selling your information to advertisers. Proton VPN, hide.me, Windscribe, TunnelBear and PrivadoVPN all fall into this category. None of them show you ads, but they're all restricted in other ways, whether by the amount you can use the VPN per month, the speeds you'll get or the servers you can access. Do I need a VPN? If you use the internet — which you must, if you're reading this — you'll benefit from a VPN. To determine what you'll need it for, though, ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes to any of them, think about subscribing to a VPN to address the problem in question. Do you feel strongly about whether your ISP and other third parties can see what you do online and use that information for profit? Do you live in a place where the law prevents you from freely using the internet and/or forbids certain platforms? Have online freedoms been temporarily suspended in your country because of unrest? Are you planning to travel to a country with restrictive internet laws? Do you normally use the internet on a network that restricts access to certain sites? Do you use the internet for any tasks that would risk your own safety or someone else's if exposed? Do you often get online through public Wi-Fi networks or networks without passwords? Are you concerned that your ISP is throttling your internet speeds? Do you want to watch TV shows and movies that aren't available in your country on the streaming services you're subscribed to? Do you want to watch events that are limited to specific regions, such as local sports? Do you enjoy looking in various regions for better deals on products you want? Are you an online gamer concerned about doxxing and/or DDoS attacks from sore losers? Different VPNs have features that make them better at various tasks from the lists above. However, the providers on my best VPN list are good at just about everything. Proton VPN is my favorite for its balance of speed, design and anonymity, but ExpressVPN is another excellent choice if you're willing to pay more for fantastic ease of use. Surfshark is the fastest VPN I've tested this year, while NordVPN has a great set of features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html?src=rss",
          "content": "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool you can use to protect your identity online, change your virtual location, evade censorship, check out foreign streaming services and more. They mostly take the form of commercially available subscription apps, often so simple to operate that all you need to do is press a button to turn them on and off. While using a VPN is easy in practice, there's a lot going on under the hood. Knowing what's really happening can help you decide which VPN is right for you, then use it more effectively once you've got it. In this guide, I'm going to delve into what a VPN really is, how it works and what you might need one for. If this article convinces you that you need a VPN — and I hope it does! — I curate a collection of the best VPN deals that I update at least once a week. Head over there to get your VPN shopping started. What is a VPN? The name \"virtual private network\" comes from the initial use of the technology to access restricted networks from off-site — if you work remotely, you probably still use a VPN this way. Those are corporate VPNs, though, from providers like Cisco. Here, we're talking about commercial VPNs sold for individual use. These services came about when people realized that if you connected to the public internet through a VPN, every server you contacted would see the VPN server instead of your personal computer. The VPN effectively becomes a mask that interacts with the web on your behalf. That's the simple principle underlying every commercial VPN you've seen advertised. Sam Chapman for Engadget VPNs like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN operate servers in various locations around the world. When you use their apps, you've got access to all the servers in their network.

          "standfirst": "The holiday season is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV, and this year looks to be no different. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find that are already available today. So far the discounts include high-end OLED TVs and well-reviewed budget sets from the likes of Samsung, LG, TCL and other popular names. We’ll be updating our roundup through Black Friday itself as more discounts arise. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that has received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Walmart. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the more expensive Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV for as little as possible, it'll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-tv-deals-we-can-find-so-far-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-181143919.html?src=rss",

It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that has received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Walmart. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the more expensive Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV for as little as possible, it'll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-tv-deals-we-can-find-so-far-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-181143919.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A few weeks short of Gemini 2's first birthday, Google has announced Gemini 3 Pro. Naturally, the company claims the new system is its most intelligent AI model yet, offering state-of-the-art reasoning, class-leading vibe coding performance and more. The good news is you can put those claims to the test today, with Google making Gemini 3 Pro available across many of its products and services. Google is highlighting a couple of benchmarks to tout Gemini 3 Pro's performance. In Humanity's Last Exam, widely considered one of the toughest tests AI labs can put their systems through, the model delivered a new top accuracy score of 37.5 percent, beating the previous leader, Grok 4, by an impressive 12.1 percentage points. Notably, it achieved its score without turning to tools like web search. On LMArena, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro is now on top of the site's leaderboards with a score of 1,501 points. Okay, but what about the practical benefits of Gemini 3 Pro? In the Gemini app, the new model will translate to answers that are more concise and better formatted. It also enables a new feature Google calls Gemini Agent. The tool builds on Project Mariner, the web-surfing Chrome AI the company debuted at the end of last year. It allows users to ask Gemini to complete tasks for them. For example, say you want help managing your email inbox. In the past, Gemini would have offered some general tips. Now, it can do that work for you. To try Gemini 3 Pro inside of the Gemini app, select \"Thinking\" from the model picker. The new model is available to everyone, though AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers can use it more often before hitting their rate limit. To make the most of Gemini Agent, you'll need to grant the tool access to your Google apps. In Search, meanwhile, Gemini 3 Pro will debut inside of AI Mode, with availability of the new model first rolling out to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Google will also bring the model to AI Overviews, where it will be used to answer the most difficult questions people ask of its search engine. In the coming weeks, Google plans to roll out a new routing algorithm for both AI Mode and AI Overviews that will know when to put questions through Gemini 3 Pro. In the meantime, subscribers can try the new model inside of AI Mode by selecting \"Thinking\" from the dropdown menu. Google In practice, Google says Gemini 3 Pro will result in AI Mode finding more credible and relevant content related to your questions. This is thanks to how the new model augments the fan-out technique that powers AI Mode. The tool will perform even more searches than before and with its new intelligence, Google suggests it may even uncover content previous models may have missed. At the same time, Gemini 3's better multi-modal understanding will translate to AI Mode generating more dynamic and interactive interfaces to answer your questions. For example, if you're researching mortgage loans, the tool can create a loan calculator directly inside of its response. For developers and its enterprise customers, Google is bringing Gemini 3 to all the usual places one can find its models, including inside of the Gemini API, AI Studio and Vertex AI. The company is also releasing a new agentic coding app called Antigravity. It can autonomously program while creating tasks for itself and providing progress reports. Alongside Gemini 3 Pro, Google is introducing Gemini 3 Deep Think. The enhanced reasoning mode will be available to safety testers before it rolls out to AI Ultra subscribers.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-new-gemini-3-model-arrives-in-ai-mode-and-the-gemini-app-160054273.html?src=rss",

You can get it now for $35. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget's favorite streaming devices. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you'll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers. The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon's Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on Samsung's The Frame) while the device is in standby. It's also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and works well as a retro game emulator, too. The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device's low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff. Also on sale is Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, our pick for the best budget streaming stick. This model doesn't support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it's certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.

          "title": "Microsoft remakes Windows for an era of autonomous AI agents",
          "standfirst": "Microsoft is fundamentally restructuring its Windows operating system to become what executives call the first \"agentic OS,\" embedding the infrastructure needed for autonomous AI agents to operate securely at enterprise scale — a watershed moment in the evolution of personal computing that positions the 40-year-old platform as the foundation for a new era of human-machine collaboration.The company announced Tuesday at its Ignite conference that it is introducing native agent infrastructure directly into Windows 11, allowing AI agents — autonomous software programs that can perform complex, multi-step tasks on behalf of users — to discover tools, execute workflows, and interact with applications through standardized protocols while operating in secure, policy-controlled environments separate from user sessions.The shift is Microsoft&#x27;s most significant architectural evolution of Windows since the introduction of the modern security model, transforming the operating system from a platform where users manually orchestrate applications into one where they can \"simply express your desired outcome, and agents handle the complexity,\" according to Pavan Davuluri, President of Windows & Devices at Microsoft.\"Windows 11 starts with this notion of secure by design, secure by default,\" Davuluri said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"And a lot of the work that we&#x27;re doing today, when we think about the engagement we have with our customers, the expectations they have with us is making sure we are building upon the fact that Windows is the most secure platform for them and is the most resilient platform as well.\"The announcements arrive as enterprises are experimenting with AI agents but struggling with fragmented tooling, security concerns, and lack of centralized management — challenges that Microsoft believes only operating system-level integration can solve. The stakes are enormous: with Windows running on an estimated 1.4 billion devices globally, Microsoft&#x27;s architectural choices will likely shape how organizations deploy autonomous AI systems for years to come.New platform primitives create foundation for agent computingAt the core of Microsoft&#x27;s vision are three new platform capabilities entering preview that fundamentally change how agents operate on Windows. Agent Connectors provide native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic that allows AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources. Microsoft has built what it calls an \"on-device registry\" — a secure, manageable repository where developers can register their applications&#x27; capabilities as agent connectors, making them discoverable to any compatible agent on the system.\"These are platform capabilities that then become available to all of our customers,\" Davuluri explained, describing how the Windows file system, for example, becomes an agent connector that any MCP-compatible agent can access with user consent. \"We&#x27;re able to do this in a fashion that can scale for one but it also allows others to participate in the Windows registry for MCP.\"The architecture introduces an MCP proxy layer that handles authentication, authorization, and auditing for all communication between agents and connectors. Microsoft is launching with two built-in agent connectors for File Explorer and System Settings, allowing agents to manage files or adjust system configurations like switching between light and dark mode — all with explicit user permission.Agent Workspace, entering private preview, represents perhaps the most significant security innovation. It creates what Microsoft describes as \"a contained, policy-controlled, and auditable environment where agents can interact with software\" — essentially a parallel desktop session where agents operate with their own distinct identity, completely separate from the user&#x27;s primary session.\"We want to be able to have clarity in the identity of the agent that is operating in the local operating system,\" Davuluri said, addressing security concerns about agents accessing sensitive data. \"We want that session to be a session that is secure, that is policy control, that is manageable, that has transparency and auditability.\"Each agent workspace runs with minimal privileges by default, accessing only explicitly granted resources. The system maintains detailed audit logs distinguishing agent actions from user actions — critical for enterprises that need to prove compliance and track all changes to systems and data.Windows 365 for Agents extends this infrastructure to the cloud, turning Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud PC offering into execution environments for agents. Instead of running on local devices, agents can operate in secure, policy-controlled virtual machines in Azure, enabling what Microsoft calls \"computer-using agents\" to interact with legacy applications and perform automation tasks at scale without consuming local compute resources.Taskbar becomes command center for monitoring AI agents at workThe infrastructure enables significant user interface changes designed to make agents as commonplace as applications. Microsoft is introducing \"Ask Copilot on the taskbar,\" a unified entry point in preview that combines Microsoft 365 Copilot, agent invocation, and traditional search in a single interface.Users will be able to invoke agents using \"@\" mentions directly from the taskbar, then monitor their progress through familiar UI patterns like hover cards, progress badges, and notifications — all while continuing other work. When an agent completes a task or needs input, it surfaces updates through the taskbar without disrupting the user&#x27;s primary workflow.\"We&#x27;ve evolved and created new UX in the taskbar to reflect the unique needs of agents performing background tasks on your behalf,\" said Navjot Virk, Corporate Vice President of Windows Experiences, describing features like progress bars and status badges that indicate when agents are working, need approval, or have completed tasks.The design philosophy, Virk emphasized, centers on user control. \"These experiences are designed to be opt in. We want to give customers full control over when and how they engage with copilots and agents.\"For commercial Microsoft 365 Copilot users, the integration goes deeper. Microsoft is embedding Copilot directly into File Explorer, allowing users to ask questions, generate summaries, or draft emails based on document contents without leaving the file management interface. On Copilot+ PCs — devices with neural processing units capable of 40 trillion operations per second — new capabilities include converting any on-screen table into an Excel spreadsheet through the Click to Do feature.Microsoft bets on open standards against Apple and Google&#x27;s proprietary approachesMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of the open Model Context Protocol, created by Anthropic, marks a strategic bet on openness as enterprises evaluate competing AI platforms from Apple and Google that use proprietary frameworks.\"Windows is an open platform, and by virtue [of being] an open platform, we certainly have the ability to take existing technologies, evolve, harden, adapt those, but we also allow customers to bring their own capabilities to the platform as well,\" Davuluri said when asked about competing with Apple Intelligence and Google&#x27;s Android AI for Enterprise.The company demonstrated this openness with Claude, Anthropic&#x27;s AI assistant, accessing the Windows file system through agent connectors with user consent — one of numerous partnerships Microsoft has secured. Dynamics 365 is using the File Explorer connector to streamline expense reporting, reducing what was previously a 30-minute, dozen-step process to \"one sentence with high accuracy,\" according to Microsoft&#x27;s blog post. Other early partners include Manus AI, Dropbox Dash, Roboflow, and Infosys.\"Windows is the platform in which they build upon,\" Davuluri said of enterprise customers. \"And so our ability to take those existing bodies of work they have, and extend them is the, I think, the least friction way for them to go, learn, adopt, experiment and find ways to [scale].\"Security model enforces strict containment and mandatory user consentMicrosoft&#x27;s security model for agents adheres to what it calls \"secure by default\" policies aligned with the company&#x27;s broader Secure Future Initiative. All agent connectors registered in the on-device registry must meet strict requirements around packaging and identity, with applications properly packaged and signed by trusted sources. Developers must explicitly declare the minimum capabilities their agent connectors require, and agents and connectors run in isolated environments with dedicated agent user accounts, separate from human user accounts. Windows requires explicit user approval when agents first access sensitive resources like files or system settings.\"We give Windows the ability to go deliver on the security expectations, and then it is auditable at the end of the day,\" Davuluri said. \"You still want an auditability log that looks similar to perhaps what you use in the cloud. And so all three pieces are built into the design and architecture of Agent Workspace.\"For IT administrators, Microsoft is introducing management policies through Intune and Group Policy that allow organizations to enable or disable agent features at device and account levels, set minimum security policy levels, and access event logs enumerating all agent connector invocations and errors. The company emphasized that agents operate with restricted privileges, with minimal permissions by default and access granted only to explicitly approved resources that users can revoke at any time. Post-quantum cryptography and recovery tools address emerging and persistent threatsBeyond agent infrastructure, Microsoft announced significant security and resilience updates addressing both emerging and persistent enterprise challenges. Post-Quantum Cryptography APIs are now generally available in Windows, allowing organizations to begin migrating to encryption algorithms designed to withstand future quantum computing attacks that could break today&#x27;s cryptographic standards. Microsoft worked closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement these algorithms.\"We are introducing post quantum cryptography APIs in Windows,\" Davuluri said. \"For customers who want to be able to do cryptographic encryption in their workloads, they can start taking advantage of these APIs in Windows for the first time. That is a huge step forward for us when we think about the future of windows.\"Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will arrive on new devices starting spring 2026, offloading disk encryption to dedicated silicon for faster performance while providing hardware-level key protection. Sysmon functionality is becoming generally available as part of Windows in early 2026, bringing advanced forensics and threat detection capabilities previously available only as a separate download directly into the operating system&#x27;s event logging system.The company also detailed progress on its Windows Resiliency Initiative, launched a year ago following the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted 8.5 million Windows devices globally. New recovery capabilities include Quick Machine Recovery with expanded networking support and Autopatch management, allowing IT to remotely fix devices stuck in Windows Recovery Environment. Point-in-time restore entering preview rolls back devices to earlier states to resolve update conflicts or configuration errors, while Cloud rebuild in preview allows IT to remotely rebuild malfunctioning devices by downloading fresh installation media and using Autopilot for zero-touch provisioning.Microsoft is also raising security requirements for third-party drivers across the Windows ecosystem. Following updated requirements for antivirus drivers effective April 1, 2025, the company is expanding this approach to other driver classes including networking, cameras, USB, printers, and storage — requiring higher certification standards, adding compiler safeguards, and providing more Windows in-box drivers to reduce reliance on third-party kernel-mode code.Measured rollout reflects enterprise caution around autonomous softwareMicrosoft is positioning these updates as essential infrastructure for what it calls \"Frontier Firms\" — organizations that \"blend human ingenuity with intelligent systems to deliver real outcomes.\" However, the company emphasized a cautious, opt-in approach that reflects enterprise concerns about autonomous software agents.\"The principles we&#x27;re using in designing these new platform capabilities accounts for the reality that we have a very, very broad user base,\" Davuluri said. \"A lot of the features and capabilities we&#x27;re building are opt in capabilities. And so it is our goal to be able to have users find value in the workflow and meet them.\"Virk emphasized the measured approach: \"This is more about meeting customers where they are and then taking them on this journey when they are ready. So there&#x27;s the optionality, but also having support for it. And really important thing is that they should feel comfortable. They should feel secure.\"Microsoft&#x27;s bet is that only operating system-level integration can provide the security, governance, and user experience required for mainstream AI agent adoption. Whether that vision materializes will depend on developer adoption, enterprise comfort with autonomous software, and Microsoft&#x27;s ability to balance innovation with the stability that 40 years of Windows customers expect. After four decades of putting users in control of their computers, Windows is now asking them to share that control with machines.",

The system maintains detailed audit logs distinguishing agent actions from user actions — critical for enterprises that need to prove compliance and track all changes to systems and data.Windows 365 for Agents extends this infrastructure to the cloud, turning Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud PC offering into execution environments for agents. Instead of running on local devices, agents can operate in secure, policy-controlled virtual machines in Azure, enabling what Microsoft calls \"computer-using agents\" to interact with legacy applications and perform automation tasks at scale without consuming local compute resources.Taskbar becomes command center for monitoring AI agents at workThe infrastructure enables significant user interface changes designed to make agents as commonplace as applications. Microsoft is introducing \"Ask Copilot on the taskbar,\" a unified entry point in preview that combines Microsoft 365 Copilot, agent invocation, and traditional search in a single interface.Users will be able to invoke agents using \"@\" mentions directly from the taskbar, then monitor their progress through familiar UI patterns like hover cards, progress badges, and notifications — all while continuing other work. When an agent completes a task or needs input, it surfaces updates through the taskbar without disrupting the user&#x27;s primary workflow.\"We&#x27;ve evolved and created new UX in the taskbar to reflect the unique needs of agents performing background tasks on your behalf,\" said Navjot Virk, Corporate Vice President of Windows Experiences, describing features like progress bars and status badges that indicate when agents are working, need approval, or have completed tasks.The design philosophy, Virk emphasized, centers on user control. \"These experiences are designed to be opt in. We want to give customers full control over when and how they engage with copilots and agents.\"For commercial Microsoft 365 Copilot users, the integration goes deeper. Microsoft is embedding Copilot directly into File Explorer, allowing users to ask questions, generate summaries, or draft emails based on document contents without leaving the file management interface. On Copilot+ PCs — devices with neural processing units capable of 40 trillion operations per second — new capabilities include converting any on-screen table into an Excel spreadsheet through the Click to Do feature.Microsoft bets on open standards against Apple and Google&#x27;s proprietary approachesMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of the open Model Context Protocol, created by Anthropic, marks a strategic bet on openness as enterprises evaluate competing AI platforms from Apple and Google that use proprietary frameworks.\"Windows is an open platform, and by virtue [of being] an open platform, we certainly have the ability to take existing technologies, evolve, harden, adapt those, but we also allow customers to bring their own capabilities to the platform as well,\" Davuluri said when asked about competing with Apple Intelligence and Google&#x27;s Android AI for Enterprise.The company demonstrated this openness with Claude, Anthropic&#x27;s AI assistant, accessing the Windows file system through agent connectors with user consent — one of numerous partnerships Microsoft has secured. Dynamics 365 is using the File Explorer connector to streamline expense reporting, reducing what was previously a 30-minute, dozen-step process to \"one sentence with high accuracy,\" according to Microsoft&#x27;s blog post. Other early partners include Manus AI, Dropbox Dash, Roboflow, and Infosys.\"Windows is the platform in which they build upon,\" Davuluri said of enterprise customers. \"And so our ability to take those existing bodies of work they have, and extend them is the, I think, the least friction way for them to go, learn, adopt, experiment and find ways to [scale].\"Security model enforces strict containment and mandatory user consentMicrosoft&#x27;s security model for agents adheres to what it calls \"secure by default\" policies aligned with the company&#x27;s broader Secure Future Initiative. All agent connectors registered in the on-device registry must meet strict requirements around packaging and identity, with applications properly packaged and signed by trusted sources. Developers must explicitly declare the minimum capabilities their agent connectors require, and agents and connectors run in isolated environments with dedicated agent user accounts, separate from human user accounts. Windows requires explicit user approval when agents first access sensitive resources like files or system settings.\"We give Windows the ability to go deliver on the security expectations, and then it is auditable at the end of the day,\" Davuluri said. \"You still want an auditability log that looks similar to perhaps what you use in the cloud. And so all three pieces are built into the design and architecture of Agent Workspace.\"For IT administrators, Microsoft is introducing management policies through Intune and Group Policy that allow organizations to enable or disable agent features at device and account levels, set minimum security policy levels, and access event logs enumerating all agent connector invocations and errors. The company emphasized that agents operate with restricted privileges, with minimal permissions by default and access granted only to explicitly approved resources that users can revoke at any time. Post-quantum cryptography and recovery tools address emerging and persistent threatsBeyond agent infrastructure, Microsoft announced significant security and resilience updates addressing both emerging and persistent enterprise challenges. Post-Quantum Cryptography APIs are now generally available in Windows, allowing organizations to begin migrating to encryption algorithms designed to withstand future quantum computing attacks that could break today&#x27;s cryptographic standards. Microsoft worked closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement these algorithms.\"We are introducing post quantum cryptography APIs in Windows,\" Davuluri said. \"For customers who want to be able to do cryptographic encryption in their workloads, they can start taking advantage of these APIs in Windows for the first time. That is a huge step forward for us when we think about the future of windows.\"Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will arrive on new devices starting spring 2026, offloading disk encryption to dedicated silicon for faster performance while providing hardware-level key protection. Sysmon functionality is becoming generally available as part of Windows in early 2026, bringing advanced forensics and threat detection capabilities previously available only as a separate download directly into the operating system&#x27;s event logging system.The company also detailed progress on its Windows Resiliency Initiative, launched a year ago following the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted 8.5 million Windows devices globally. New recovery capabilities include Quick Machine Recovery with expanded networking support and Autopatch management, allowing IT to remotely fix devices stuck in Windows Recovery Environment. Point-in-time restore entering preview rolls back devices to earlier states to resolve update conflicts or configuration errors, while Cloud rebuild in preview allows IT to remotely rebuild malfunctioning devices by downloading fresh installation media and using Autopilot for zero-touch provisioning.Microsoft is also raising security requirements for third-party drivers across the Windows ecosystem. Following updated requirements for antivirus drivers effective April 1, 2025, the company is expanding this approach to other driver classes including networking, cameras, USB, printers, and storage — requiring higher certification standards, adding compiler safeguards, and providing more Windows in-box drivers to reduce reliance on third-party kernel-mode code.Measured rollout reflects enterprise caution around autonomous softwareMicrosoft is positioning these updates as essential infrastructure for what it calls \"Frontier Firms\" — organizations that \"blend human ingenuity with intelligent systems to deliver real outcomes.\" However, the company emphasized a cautious, opt-in approach that reflects enterprise concerns about autonomous software agents.\"The principles we&#x27;re using in designing these new platform capabilities accounts for the reality that we have a very, very broad user base,\" Davuluri said. \"A lot of the features and capabilities we&#x27;re building are opt in capabilities. And so it is our goal to be able to have users find value in the workflow and meet them.\"Virk emphasized the measured approach: \"This is more about meeting customers where they are and then taking them on this journey when they are ready. So there&#x27;s the optionality, but also having support for it. And really important thing is that they should feel comfortable. They should feel secure.\"Microsoft&#x27;s bet is that only operating system-level integration can provide the security, governance, and user experience required for mainstream AI agent adoption. Whether that vision materializes will depend on developer adoption, enterprise comfort with autonomous software, and Microsoft&#x27;s ability to balance innovation with the stability that 40 years of Windows customers expect. After four decades of putting users in control of their computers, Windows is now asking them to share that control with machines.",

          "standfirst": "Semantic intelligence is a critical element of actually understanding what data means and how it can be used.Microsoft is now deeply integrating semantics and ontologies into its Fabric data platform with its new Fabric IQ technology that it debuted at the Microsoft Ignite conference Tuesday.Fabric IQ is a semantic intelligence layer designed to address a fundamental problem with enterprise AI agents: Effectiveness depends not just on dataset size but on how well data reflects actual business operations. The new technology creates a shared semantic structure that maps datasets to real-world entities, their relationships, hierarchies, and operational context. The semantic layer represents the latest step in Microsoft&#x27;s data platform strategy, which recently integrated LinkedIn&#x27;s graph database technology to provide context.Microsoft is also expanding its data portfolio with a series of new services: Azure HorizonDB, a PostgreSQL-compatible service in early preview, as well as SQL Server 2025 and Azure DocumentDB, which are now generally available.\"When I think about what fabric does for customers, it gives customers a unified data platform so that they don&#x27;t have to stitch together many, many, many different tools to get to business value,\" said Arun Ulag, corporate vice president of Azure Data at Microsoft.Why semantic understanding matters for AI agentsTraditional AI agents struggle with a fundamental limitation: they can see patterns in data but don&#x27;t understand what that data represents in business terms. An agent might analyze sales transactions without understanding customer hierarchies, seasonal patterns or product relationships. It can query inventory levels without knowing how production lines connect to distribution networks or how supplier relationships affect availability.This gap between raw data and business meaning is what causes unreliable predictions and poor automated decisions. Ulag explained that Fabric IQ addresses this by providing a semantic layer that captures how organizations actually operate.This architectural approach differs significantly from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and vector database strategies that competitors have emphasized.While RAG pulls relevant documents to provide context, Fabric IQ creates a persistent semantic graph representing organizational structure, workflows and business logic. Agents don&#x27;t just retrieve information. They understand relationships like which suppliers provide which products, how production lines connect to inventory systems or how customer hierarchies map to sales territories.From analytics semantic models to operational ontologiesMicrosoft has invested in semantic models for over a decade through Power BI. These models encapsulate business logic and define entities and relationships; they specify metrics and hierarchies; and they connect to diverse data sources across Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, on-premises systems, and SaaS platforms like Dynamics 365.\"We have 20 million semantic models that run in fabric today. Why? Because we built the semantic modeling layer into Power BI. So behind every Power BI report is a semantic model,\" Ulag said. \"These semantic models already encapsulate a lot of the business logic that mirrors what a customer cares about. What is the data that they care about? What are the metrics that they care about? How does the data relate to each other?\"The limitation of these semantic models has been their scope. They worked well for business intelligence, analytics, and visualization, but they only operated within individual reports or departmental boundaries. Fabric IQ removes these constraints.\"However, we&#x27;ve had a gap. These semantic models were only used for BI use cases,\" Ulag said. \"There&#x27;s a much bigger opportunity out there, which is the opportunity to be able to take these semantic models and upgrade them into a full ontology.\"Upgrading the semantic models to ontologies fundamentally changes what organizations can do with business context and meaning. \"What does it do if you upgrade them into an ontology? What happens is that now you can connect data across your enterprise,\" Ulag said. He explained that the ontology also integrates with real-time data streams. Beyond connecting data, ontologies allow organizations to define operational rules. This combination creates the foundation for operational agents that understand business context at a level that traditional AI systems cannot achieve. Cross-enterprise data connections work together with real-time integration and rule definitions.Operational agents that understand and act on business operationsFabric IQ enables a new class of agents Microsoft calls \"operational agents.\" These agents can autonomously monitor data and take action based on the ontology&#x27;s understanding of business operations.\"We&#x27;re also introducing something called operations agents in fabric that can watch your data for you, that can watch the rules that you&#x27;re asking it to monitor. And it can autonomously take action under human supervision,\" Ulag said.Ulag provided a supply chain example that illustrates the difference from traditional approaches. An organization can model its supply chain and delivery operations in the ontology. When real-time data shows congestion in part of a city, the operational agent can automatically reroute trucks around the problem.The ontologies created in Fabric IQ integrate directly with Microsoft&#x27;s agent development platforms. This provides business context that makes agents more reliable and accurate.\"It really takes the work that we&#x27;ve done in semantic models in fabric with unified data to a completely different level, allowing customers to be able to model their operations and take business actions,\" Ulag said.What this means for enterprise AI strategiesThere seems to be a need for context engineering to better enable agentic AI.Semantics and their associated ontologies do just that and more. Context is about understanding why a request is being made, and semantics understand the deeper meaning. For enterprises struggling with AI agent reliability despite large datasets, Fabric IQ represents a fundamentally different approach. It moves beyond scaling compute or fine-tuning models. The critical question is whether business context captured in ontologies would improve agent effectiveness more than traditional optimization paths.The strategic bet Microsoft is making is clear: Semantic understanding of business operations determines AI agent effectiveness.

          "title": "Google unveils Gemini 3 claiming the lead in math, science, multimodal and agentic AI benchmarks",
          "standfirst": "After more than a month of rumors and feverish speculation — including Polymarket wagering on the release date — Google today unveiled Gemini 3, its newest proprietary frontier model family and the company’s most comprehensive AI release since the Gemini line debuted in 2023. The models are proprietary (closed-source), available exclusively through Google products, developer platforms, and paid APIs, including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini command line interface (CLI) for developers, and third-party integrations across the broader integrated developer environment (IDE) ecosystem.Gemini 3 arrives as a full portfolio, including:Gemini 3 Pro: the flagship frontier modelGemini 3 Deep Think: an enhanced reasoning modeGenerative interface models powering Visual Layout and Dynamic ViewGemini Agent for multi-step task executionGemini 3 engine embedded in Google Antigravity, the company’s new agent-first development environment.\"This is the best model in the world, by a crazy wide margin!\" wrote Google DeepMind Research Scientist Yi Tay on X. Indeed, already, independent AI benchmarking and analysis organization Artificial Analysis has crowned Gemini 3 Pro the \"new leader in AI\" globally, achieving the top score of 73 on the organization&#x27;s index, leaping Google from its former placement of 9th overall with the preceding Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which scored 60 behind OpenAI, Moonshot AI, xAI, Anthropic and MiniMax models. As Artificial Analysis wrote on X: \"For the first time, Google has the most intelligent model.\"Another independent leaderboard site, LMArena reported that Gemini 3 Pro ranked first in the world across all of its major evaluation tracks, including text reasoning, vision, coding, and web development. In a public post, the @arena account on X said the model surpassed even the newly released (hours old) Grok-4.1, as well as Claude 4.5, and GPT-5-class systems in categories such as math, long-form queries, creative writing, and several occupational benchmarks. The post also highlighted the scale of gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro, including a 50-point jump in text Elo, a 70-point increase in vision, and a 280-point rise in web-development tasks. While these results reflect live community voting and remain preliminary, they signal unusually broad performance improvements across domains where previous Gemini models trailed competitors.What It Means For Google In the Hotly Competitive AI RaceThe launch represents one of Google’s largest, most tightly coordinated model releases. Gemini 3 is shipping simultaneously across Google Search, the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a range of developer tools. Executives emphasized that this integration reflects Google’s control of tensor processing unit (TPU — its homegrown Nvidia GPU rival chips) hardware, data center infrastructure, and consumer products. According to the company, the Gemini app now has more than 650 million monthly active users, more than 13 million developers build with Google’s AI tools, and more than 2 billion monthly users engage with Gemini-powered AI Overviews in Search.At the center of the release is a shift toward agentic AI — systems that plan, act, navigate interfaces, and coordinate tools, rather than just generating text. Gemini 3 is designed to translate high-level instructions into multi-step workflows across devices and applications, with the ability to generate functional interfaces, run tools, and manage complex tasks.Major Performance Gains Over Gemini 2.5 ProGemini 3 Pro introduces large gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro across reasoning, mathematics, multimodality, tool use, coding, and long-horizon planning. Google’s benchmark disclosures show substantial improvements in many categories.Gemini 3 Pro debuted at the top of the LMArena text-reasoning leaderboard, posting a preliminary Elo score of 1501 based on pre-release community voting — the first LLM to ever cross the 1500 threshold.That places it above xAI’s newly announced Grok-4.1-thinking model (1484) and Grok-4.1 (1465), both of which were unveiled just hours earlier, as well as above Gemini 2.5 Pro (1451) and recent Claude Sonnet and Opus releases. While LMArena covers only text-reasoning performance and the results are labeled preliminary, this ranking positions Gemini 3 Pro as the strongest publicly evaluated model on that benchmark as of its launch day — though not necessarily the top performer in the world across all modalities, tasks, or evaluation suites.In mathematical and scientific reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro scored 95 percent on AIME 2025 without tools and 100 percent with code execution, compared to 88 percent for its predecessor. On GPQA Diamond, it reached 91.9 percent, up from 86.4 percent. The model also recorded a major jump on MathArena Apex, reaching 23.4 percent versus 0.5 percent for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and delivered 31.1 percent on ARC-AGI-2 compared to 4.9 percent previously.ARC-AGI-2 is the second-generation version of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark introduced by AI researcher François Chollet to measure generalization, not memorization. Unlike typical multiple-choice or dataset-based evaluations, ARC-AGI-2 presents models with tiny grid-based puzzles that require discovering and applying abstract rules. Each task provides a few input–output examples, and the model must infer the underlying transformation and apply it to a new test case. The problems span visual pattern recognition, symbolic manipulation, object transformations, spatial reasoning, and rule induction — all designed to test reasoning capabilities that do not depend on training-set familiarity.The new ARC-AGI-2 variant is deliberately constructed to be out-of-distribution and resistant to memorization, making it one of the most difficult benchmarks for large language models. Its tasks are engineered to stress-test whether a model can infer a previously unseen rule purely from examples, a proxy for early forms of generalized problem-solving. Astonishingly, the \"Deep Think\" version of Gemini 3, designed to take longer to solve problems and use more reasoning, scored 45.1%, representing a substantial jump over prior frontier models, which typically score in the mid-teens to low-twenties. It also far exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s 31.1% and is an order-of-magnitude improvement over older Gemini releases. These results suggest that Deep Think’s architecture is particularly effective at multi-step hypothesis generation, checking, and revision — the specific capabilities ARC-AGI-2 is designed to measure.Multimodal performance increased across the board. Gemini 3 Pro scored 81 percent on MMMU-Pro, up from 68 percent, and 87.6 percent on Video-MMMU, compared to 83.6 percent. Its result on ScreenSpot-Pro, a key benchmark for agentic computer use, rose from 11.4 percent to 72.7 percent. Document understanding and chart reasoning also improved.Coding and tool-use performance showed equally significant gains. The model’s LiveCodeBench Pro score reached 2,439, up from 1,775. On Terminal-Bench 2.0 it achieved 54.2 percent versus 32.6 percent previously. SWE-Bench Verified, which measures agentic coding through structured fixes, increased from 59.6 percent to 76.2 percent. The model also posted 85.4 percent on t2-bench, up from 54.9 percent.Long-context and planning benchmarks indicate more stable multi-step behavior. Gemini 3 achieved 77 percent on MRCR v2 at 128k context (versus 58 percent) and 26.3 percent at 1 million tokens (versus 16.4 percent). Its Vending-Bench 2 score reached $5,478.16, compared to $573.64 for Gemini 2.5 Pro, reflecting stronger consistency during long-running decision processes.Language understanding scores improved on SimpleQA Verified (72.1 percent versus 54.5 percent), MMLU (91.8 percent versus 89.5 percent), and the FACTS Benchmark Suite (70.5 percent versus 63.4 percent), supporting more reliable fact-based work in regulated sectors.Generative Interfaces Move Gemini Beyond TextGemini 3 introduces a new class of generative interface capabilities in the consumer-facing Google Search AI Mode and for developers through Google AI Studio.Visual Layout produces structured, magazine-style pages with images, diagrams, and modules tailored to the query. Dynamic View generates functional interface components such as calculators, simulations, galleries, and interactive graphs. These experiences will be available starting today globally in Google Search’s AI Mode, enabling models to surface information in visual, interactive formats beyond static text.Developers can reproduce similar UI elements through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API, but the full consumer-facing interface types are not available as direct API outputs; instead, developers receive the underlying code or schema to render these components themselves. The branded Visual Layout and Dynamic View formats are therefore specific to Search and not exposed as standalone API features.Google says the model analyzes user intent to construct the layout best suited to a task. In practice, this includes everything from automatically building diagrams for scientific concepts to generating custom UI components that respond to user input.Google held a press call the day before the Gemini 3 announcement to brief reporters on the model family, its intended use cases, and how it differed from earlier Gemini releases. The call was led by multiple Google and DeepMind executives who walked through the model’s capabilities and framed Gemini 3 as a step toward more reliable, multi-step agentic systems that can operate across Google’s ecosystem.During the briefing, speakers emphasized that Gemini 3 was engineered to support more consistent long-horizon reasoning, better tool use, and smoother planning loops than Gemini 2.5 Pro. One presenter said the model benefits from an architecture that allows it to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses in parallel, improving reliability on mathematically hard questions and complex procedural tasks. Another speaker explained that Gemini 3’s improved spatial reasoning enables more robust interaction with interface elements, which supports agentic workflows across screens and applications.Presenters highlighted growing enterprise adoption, noting strong demand for multimodal analysis, structured document reasoning, and agentic coding tools. They said Gemini 3’s performance on multimodal and scientific benchmarks reflected Google’s focus on grounded, verifiable reasoning. And they discussed Gemini 3&#x27;s safety processes and improvements, including reduced sycophancy, stronger prompt-injection resistance, and a more structured evaluation pipeline guided by Google’s Frontier Safety Framework introduced back in 2024.A portion of the call was dedicated to developer experience. Google described updates to its AI Studio and API that allow developers to control thinking depth, adjust model “resolution,” and combine new grounding tools with URL context and Search. Demoes showed Gemini 3 generating application interfaces, managing tool sequences, and debugging code in Antigravity, illustrating the model’s shift toward agentic operation rather than single-step generation.The call positioned Gemini 3 as an upgrade across reasoning, planning, multimodal understanding, and developer workflows, with Google framing these advances as the foundation for its next generation of agent-driven products and enterprise services.Gemini Agent Introduces Multi-Step Workflow AutomationGemini Agent marks Google’s effort to move beyond conversational assistance toward operational AI. The system coordinates multi-step tasks across tools like Gmail, Calendar, Canvas, and live browsing. It reviews inboxes, drafts replies, prepares plans, triages information, and reasons through complex workflows, while requiring user approval before performing sensitive actions.On a press call with journalists ahead of the release yesterday, Google said the agent is designed to handle multi-turn planning and tool-use sequences with consistency that was not feasible in earlier generations. It is rolling out first to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app.Google Antigravity and Developer Toolchain IntegrationAntigravity is Google’s new agent-first development environment designed around Gemini 3. Developers collaborate with agents across an editor, terminal, and browser. The system orchestrates full-stack tasks, including code generation, UI prototyping, debugging, live execution, and report generation.Across the broader developer ecosystem, Google AI Studio now includes a Build mode that automatically wires the right models and APIs to speed up AI-native app creation. Annotations support allows developers to attach prompts to UI elements for faster iteration. Spatial reasoning improvements enable agents to interpret mouse movements, screen annotations, and multi-window layouts to operate computer interfaces more effectively.Developers also gain new reasoning controls through “thinking level” and “model resolution” parameters in the Gemini API, along with stricter validation of thought signatures for multi-turn consistency. A hosted server-side bash tool supports secure, multi-language code generation and prototyping. Grounding with Google Search and URL context can now be combined to extract structured information for downstream tasks.Enterprise Impact and AdoptionEnterprise teams gain multimodal understanding, agentic coding, and long-horizon planning needed for production use cases. The new model unifies analysis of documents, audio, video, workflows, and logs. Improvements in spatial and visual reasoning support robotics, autonomous systems, and scenarios requiring navigation of screens and applications. High-frame-rate video understanding helps developers detect events in fast-moving environments.Gemini 3’s structured document understanding capabilities support legal review, complex form processing, and regulated workflows. Its ability to generate functional interfaces and prototypes with minimal prompting reduces engineering cycles. In addition, the gains in system reliability, tool-calling stability, and context retention make multi-step planning viable for operations like financial forecasting, customer support automation, supply chain modeling, and predictive maintenance.Developer and API PricingGoogle has disclosed initial API pricing for Gemini 3 Pro. In preview, the model is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens for prompts up to 200,000 tokens in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. For prompts that require more than 200,000 tokens, the input pricing doubles to $2 per 1M tok, while the output rises to $18 per 1M tok.When compared to the API pricing for other frontier AI models from rival labs, Gemini 3 is priced in the mid-high range, which may impact adoption as cheaper and open-source (permissively licensed) Chinese models have increasingly come to be adopted by U.S. startups.

These capabilities extend to desktop and mobile environments, enabling agents to interpret screen elements, respond to on-screen context, and unlock new forms of computer-use automation.The model also delivers improved video reasoning with high-frame-rate understanding for analyzing fast-moving scenes, along with long-context video recall for synthesizing narratives across hours of footage. Google’s examples show the model generating full interactive demo apps directly from prompts, illustrating the depth of multimodal and agentic integration.Vibe Coding and Agentic Code GenerationGemini 3 advances Google’s concept of “vibe coding,” where natural language acts as the primary syntax. The model can translate high-level ideas into full applications with a single prompt, handling multi-step planning, code generation, and visual design. Enterprise partners like Figma, JetBrains, Cursor, Replit, and Cline report stronger instruction following, more stable agentic operation, and better long-context code manipulation compared to prior models.Rumors and RumblingsIn the weeks leading up to the announcement, X became a hub of speculation about Gemini 3. Well-known accounts such as @slow_developer suggested internal builds were significantly ahead of Gemini 2.5 Pro and likely exceeded competitor performance in reasoning and tool use. Others, including @synthwavedd and @VraserX, noted mixed behavior in early checkpoints but acknowledged Google’s advantage in TPU hardware and training data. Viral clips from users like @lepadphone and @StijnSmits showed the model generating websites, animations, and UI layouts from single prompts, adding to the momentum.Prediction markets on Polymarket amplified the speculation. Whale accounts drove the odds of a mid-November release sharply upward, prompting widespread debate about insider activity. A temporary dip during a global Cloudflare outage became a moment of humor and conspiracy before odds surged again.The key moment came when users including @cheatyyyy shared what appeared to be an internal model-card benchmark table for Gemini 3 Pro. The image circulated rapidly, with commentary from figures like @deedydas and @kimmonismus arguing the numbers suggested a significant lead. When Google published the official benchmarks, they matched the leaked table exactly, confirming the document’s authenticity.By launch day, enthusiasm reached a peak. A brief “Geminiii” post from Sundar Pichai triggered widespread attention, and early testers quickly shared real examples of Gemini 3 generating interfaces, full apps, and complex visual designs. While some concerns about pricing and efficiency appeared, the dominant sentiment framed the launch as a turning point for Google and a display of its full-stack AI capabilities.Safety and EvaluationGoogle says Gemini 3 is its most secure model yet, with reduced sycophancy, stronger prompt-injection resistance, and better protection against misuse. The company partnered with external groups, including Apollo and Vaultis, and conducted evaluations using its Frontier Safety Framework.Deployment Across Google ProductsGemini 3 is available across Google Search AI Mode, the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini CLI, and Google’s new agentic development platform, Antigravity. Google says additional Gemini 3 variants will arrive later.ConclusionGemini 3 represents Google’s largest step forward in reasoning, multimodality, enterprise reliability, and agentic capabilities. The model’s performance gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro are substantial across mathematical reasoning, vision, coding, and planning. Generative interfaces, Gemini Agent, and Antigravity demonstrate a shift toward systems that not only respond to prompts but plan tasks, construct interfaces, and coordinate tools. Combined with an unusually intense hype and leak cycle, the launch marks a significant moment in the AI landscape as Google moves aggressively to expand its presence across both consumer-facing and enterprise-facing AI workflows.",
          "content": "After more than a month of rumors and feverish speculation — including Polymarket wagering on the release date — Google today unveiled Gemini 3, its newest proprietary frontier model family and the company’s most comprehensive AI release since the Gemini line debuted in 2023. The models are proprietary (closed-source), available exclusively through Google products, developer platforms, and paid APIs, including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini command line interface (CLI) for developers, and third-party integrations across the broader integrated developer environment (IDE) ecosystem.Gemini 3 arrives as a full portfolio, including:Gemini 3 Pro: the flagship frontier modelGemini 3 Deep Think: an enhanced reasoning modeGenerative interface models powering Visual Layout and Dynamic ViewGemini Agent for multi-step task executionGemini 3 engine embedded in Google Antigravity, the company’s new agent-first development environment.\"This is the best model in the world, by a crazy wide margin!\" wrote Google DeepMind Research Scientist Yi Tay on X. Indeed, already, independent AI benchmarking and analysis organization Artificial Analysis has crowned Gemini 3 Pro the \"new leader in AI\" globally, achieving the top score of 73 on the organization&#x27;s index, leaping Google from its former placement of 9th overall with the preceding Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which scored 60 behind OpenAI, Moonshot AI, xAI, Anthropic and MiniMax models. As Artificial Analysis wrote on X: \"For the first time, Google has the most intelligent model.\"Another independent leaderboard site, LMArena reported that Gemini 3 Pro ranked first in the world across all of its major evaluation tracks, including text reasoning, vision, coding, and web development. In a public post, the @arena account on X said the model surpassed even the newly released (hours old) Grok-4.1, as well as Claude 4.5, and GPT-5-class systems in categories such as math, long-form queries, creative writing, and several occupational benchmarks. The post also highlighted the scale of gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro, including a 50-point jump in text Elo, a 70-point increase in vision, and a 280-point rise in web-development tasks. While these results reflect live community voting and remain preliminary, they signal unusually broad performance improvements across domains where previous Gemini models trailed competitors.What It Means For Google In the Hotly Competitive AI RaceThe launch represents one of Google’s largest, most tightly coordinated model releases. Gemini 3 is shipping simultaneously across Google Search, the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a range of developer tools. Executives emphasized that this integration reflects Google’s control of tensor processing unit (TPU — its homegrown Nvidia GPU rival chips) hardware, data center infrastructure, and consumer products. According to the company, the Gemini app now has more than 650 million monthly active users, more than 13 million developers build with Google’s AI tools, and more than 2 billion monthly users engage with Gemini-powered AI Overviews in Search.At the center of the release is a shift toward agentic AI — systems that plan, act, navigate interfaces, and coordinate tools, rather than just generating text. Gemini 3 is designed to translate high-level instructions into multi-step workflows across devices and applications, with the ability to generate functional interfaces, run tools, and manage complex tasks.Major Performance Gains Over Gemini 2.5 ProGemini 3 Pro introduces large gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro across reasoning, mathematics, multimodality, tool use, coding, and long-horizon planning. Google’s benchmark disclosures show substantial improvements in many categories.Gemini 3 Pro debuted at the top of the LMArena text-reasoning leaderboard, posting a preliminary Elo score of 1501 based on pre-release community voting — the first LLM to ever cross the 1500 threshold.That places it above xAI’s newly announced Grok-4.1-thinking model (1484) and Grok-4.1 (1465), both of which were unveiled just hours earlier, as well as above Gemini 2.5 Pro (1451) and recent Claude Sonnet and Opus releases. While LMArena covers only text-reasoning performance and the results are labeled preliminary, this ranking positions Gemini 3 Pro as the strongest publicly evaluated model on that benchmark as of its launch day — though not necessarily the top performer in the world across all modalities, tasks, or evaluation suites.In mathematical and scientific reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro scored 95 percent on AIME 2025 without tools and 100 percent with code execution, compared to 88 percent for its predecessor. On GPQA Diamond, it reached 91.9 percent, up from 86.4 percent. The model also recorded a major jump on MathArena Apex, reaching 23.4 percent versus 0.5 percent for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and delivered 31.1 percent on ARC-AGI-2 compared to 4.9 percent previously.ARC-AGI-2 is the second-generation version of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark introduced by AI researcher François Chollet to measure generalization, not memorization. Unlike typical multiple-choice or dataset-based evaluations, ARC-AGI-2 presents models with tiny grid-based puzzles that require discovering and applying abstract rules. Each task provides a few input–output examples, and the model must infer the underlying transformation and apply it to a new test case. The problems span visual pattern recognition, symbolic manipulation, object transformations, spatial reasoning, and rule induction — all designed to test reasoning capabilities that do not depend on training-set familiarity.The new ARC-AGI-2 variant is deliberately constructed to be out-of-distribution and resistant to memorization, making it one of the most difficult benchmarks for large language models. Its tasks are engineered to stress-test whether a model can infer a previously unseen rule purely from examples, a proxy for early forms of generalized problem-solving. Astonishingly, the \"Deep Think\" version of Gemini 3, designed to take longer to solve problems and use more reasoning, scored 45.1%, representing a substantial jump over prior frontier models, which typically score in the mid-teens to low-twenties. It also far exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s 31.1% and is an order-of-magnitude improvement over older Gemini releases. These results suggest that Deep Think’s architecture is particularly effective at multi-step hypothesis generation, checking, and revision — the specific capabilities ARC-AGI-2 is designed to measure.Multimodal performance increased across the board. Gemini 3 Pro scored 81 percent on MMMU-Pro, up from 68 percent, and 87.6 percent on Video-MMMU, compared to 83.6 percent. Its result on ScreenSpot-Pro, a key benchmark for agentic computer use, rose from 11.4 percent to 72.7 percent. Document understanding and chart reasoning also improved.Coding and tool-use performance showed equally significant gains. The model’s LiveCodeBench Pro score reached 2,439, up from 1,775. On Terminal-Bench 2.0 it achieved 54.2 percent versus 32.6 percent previously. SWE-Bench Verified, which measures agentic coding through structured fixes, increased from 59.6 percent to 76.2 percent. The model also posted 85.4 percent on t2-bench, up from 54.9 percent.Long-context and planning benchmarks indicate more stable multi-step behavior. Gemini 3 achieved 77 percent on MRCR v2 at 128k context (versus 58 percent) and 26.3 percent at 1 million tokens (versus 16.4 percent). Its Vending-Bench 2 score reached $5,478.16, compared to $573.64 for Gemini 2.5 Pro, reflecting stronger consistency during long-running decision processes.Language understanding scores improved on SimpleQA Verified (72.1 percent versus 54.5 percent), MMLU (91.8 percent versus 89.5 percent), and the FACTS Benchmark Suite (70.5 percent versus 63.4 percent), supporting more reliable fact-based work in regulated sectors.Generative Interfaces Move Gemini Beyond TextGemini 3 introduces a new class of generative interface capabilities in the consumer-facing Google Search AI Mode and for developers through Google AI Studio.Visual Layout produces structured, magazine-style pages with images, diagrams, and modules tailored to the query. Dynamic View generates functional interface components such as calculators, simulations, galleries, and interactive graphs. These experiences will be available starting today globally in Google Search’s AI Mode, enabling models to surface information in visual, interactive formats beyond static text.Developers can reproduce similar UI elements through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API, but the full consumer-facing interface types are not available as direct API outputs; instead, developers receive the underlying code or schema to render these components themselves. The branded Visual Layout and Dynamic View formats are therefore specific to Search and not exposed as standalone API features.Google says the model analyzes user intent to construct the layout best suited to a task. In practice, this includes everything from automatically building diagrams for scientific concepts to generating custom UI components that respond to user input.Google held a press call the day before the Gemini 3 announcement to brief reporters on the model family, its intended use cases, and how it differed from earlier Gemini releases. The call was led by multiple Google and DeepMind executives who walked through the model’s capabilities and framed Gemini 3 as a step toward more reliable, multi-step agentic systems that can operate across Google’s ecosystem.During the briefing, speakers emphasized that Gemini 3 was engineered to support more consistent long-horizon reasoning, better tool use, and smoother planning loops than Gemini 2.5 Pro. One presenter said the model benefits from an architecture that allows it to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses in parallel, improving reliability on mathematically hard questions and complex procedural tasks. Another speaker explained that Gemini 3’s improved spatial reasoning enables more robust interaction with interface elements, which supports agentic workflows across screens and applications.Presenters highlighted growing enterprise adoption, noting strong demand for multimodal analysis, structured document reasoning, and agentic coding tools. They said Gemini 3’s performance on multimodal and scientific benchmarks reflected Google’s focus on grounded, verifiable reasoning. And they discussed Gemini 3&#x27;s safety processes and improvements, including reduced sycophancy, stronger prompt-injection resistance, and a more structured evaluation pipeline guided by Google’s Frontier Safety Framework introduced back in 2024.A portion of the call was dedicated to developer experience. Google described updates to its AI Studio and API that allow developers to control thinking depth, adjust model “resolution,” and combine new grounding tools with URL context and Search. Demoes showed Gemini 3 generating application interfaces, managing tool sequences, and debugging code in Antigravity, illustrating the model’s shift toward agentic operation rather than single-step generation.The call positioned Gemini 3 as an upgrade across reasoning, planning, multimodal understanding, and developer workflows, with Google framing these advances as the foundation for its next generation of agent-driven products and enterprise services.Gemini Agent Introduces Multi-Step Workflow AutomationGemini Agent marks Google’s effort to move beyond conversational assistance toward operational AI. The system coordinates multi-step tasks across tools like Gmail, Calendar, Canvas, and live browsing. It reviews inboxes, drafts replies, prepares plans, triages information, and reasons through complex workflows, while requiring user approval before performing sensitive actions.On a press call with journalists ahead of the release yesterday, Google said the agent is designed to handle multi-turn planning and tool-use sequences with consistency that was not feasible in earlier generations. It is rolling out first to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app.Google Antigravity and Developer Toolchain IntegrationAntigravity is Google’s new agent-first development environment designed around Gemini 3. Developers collaborate with agents across an editor, terminal, and browser. The system orchestrates full-stack tasks, including code generation, UI prototyping, debugging, live execution, and report generation.Across the broader developer ecosystem, Google AI Studio now includes a Build mode that automatically wires the right models and APIs to speed up AI-native app creation. Annotations support allows developers to attach prompts to UI elements for faster iteration. Spatial reasoning improvements enable agents to interpret mouse movements, screen annotations, and multi-window layouts to operate computer interfaces more effectively.Developers also gain new reasoning controls through “thinking level” and “model resolution” parameters in the Gemini API, along with stricter validation of thought signatures for multi-turn consistency. A hosted server-side bash tool supports secure, multi-language code generation and prototyping. Grounding with Google Search and URL context can now be combined to extract structured information for downstream tasks.Enterprise Impact and AdoptionEnterprise teams gain multimodal understanding, agentic coding, and long-horizon planning needed for production use cases. The new model unifies analysis of documents, audio, video, workflows, and logs. Improvements in spatial and visual reasoning support robotics, autonomous systems, and scenarios requiring navigation of screens and applications. High-frame-rate video understanding helps developers detect events in fast-moving environments.Gemini 3’s structured document understanding capabilities support legal review, complex form processing, and regulated workflows. Its ability to generate functional interfaces and prototypes with minimal prompting reduces engineering cycles. In addition, the gains in system reliability, tool-calling stability, and context retention make multi-step planning viable for operations like financial forecasting, customer support automation, supply chain modeling, and predictive maintenance.Developer and API PricingGoogle has disclosed initial API pricing for Gemini 3 Pro. In preview, the model is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens for prompts up to 200,000 tokens in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. For prompts that require more than 200,000 tokens, the input pricing doubles to $2 per 1M tok, while the output rises to $18 per 1M tok.When compared to the API pricing for other frontier AI models from rival labs, Gemini 3 is priced in the mid-high range, which may impact adoption as cheaper and open-source (permissively licensed) Chinese models have increasingly come to be adopted by U.S. startups.

          "title": "Writer's AI agents can actually do your work—not just chat about it",
          "standfirst": "Writer, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, is launching a unified AI agent platform designed to let any employee automate complex business workflows without writing code — a capability the company says distinguishes it from consumer-oriented tools like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT.The platform, called Writer Agent, combines chat-based assistance with autonomous task execution in a single interface. Starting Tuesday, enterprise customers can use natural language to instruct the AI to create presentations, analyze financial data, generate marketing campaigns, or coordinate across multiple business systems like Salesforce, Slack, and Google Workspace—then save those workflows as reusable \"Playbooks\" that run automatically on schedules.The announcement comes as enterprises struggle to move AI initiatives beyond pilot programs into production at scale. Writer CEO May Habib has been outspoken about this challenge, recently revealing that 42% of Fortune 500 executives surveyed by her company said AI is \"tearing their company apart\" due to coordination failures between departments.\"We&#x27;re delivering an agent interface that is both incredibly powerful and radically simple to transform individual productivity into organizational impact,\" Habib said in a statement. \"Writer Agent is the difference between a single sales rep asking a chatbot to write an outreach email and an enterprise ensuring that 1,000 reps are all sending on-brand, compliant, and contextually-aware messages to target accounts.\"How Writer is putting workflow automation in the hands of non-technical workersThe platform&#x27;s core innovation centers on making workflow automation accessible to non-technical employees—what Writer executives call \"democratizing who gets to be a builder.\"In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Doris Jwo, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, demonstrated how the system works: A user types a request in plain English — for example, \"Create a two-page partnership proposal between [Company A] and [Company B], make it a branded deck, include impact metrics and partnership tiers.\"The AI agent then breaks down that request into discrete steps, conducts web research, generates graphics and charts on the fly, creates individual slides with sourced information, and assembles a complete presentation. The entire process, which might take an employee hours or days, can be completed in 10-12 minutes.\"The agent basically looks at the request, breaks it down, does research, understands what pieces it needs, creates a detailed plan at a step-by-step level,\" Jwo explained during a product demonstration. \"It might say, &#x27;I need to do web research,&#x27; or &#x27;This user needs information from Gong or Slack,&#x27; and it reaches out to those connectors, grabs the data, and executes the plan.\"Crucially, users can save these multi-step processes as Playbooks—reusable templates that colleagues can deploy with a single click. Routines allow those Playbooks to run automatically at scheduled intervals, essentially putting knowledge work \"on autopilot.\"Security and compliance controls: Writer&#x27;s answer to enterprise IT concernsWriter positions these enterprise-focused controls as a key differentiator from competitors. While Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic offer powerful AI capabilities, Writer&#x27;s executives argue those tools weren&#x27;t designed from the ground up for the security, compliance, and governance requirements of large regulated organizations.\"All of the products you mentioned are great products, but even Copilot is very much focused on personal productivity—summarizing email, for example, which is important, but that&#x27;s not the component we&#x27;re focusing on,\" said Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.Shetrit emphasized Writer&#x27;s \"trust, security, and interoperability\" approach. IT administrators can granularly control what the AI can access — for instance, preventing market research agents from mentioning competitors, or restricting which employees can use web search capabilities. All activity is logged with detailed audit trails showing exactly what data the agent touched and what actions it took.\"These fine-grained controls are what make products enterprise-ready,\" Shetrit said. \"We can deploy to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees while maintaining the security and guardrails you need for that scale.\"This architecture reflects Writer&#x27;s origin story. Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic, which started as research labs and later added enterprise offerings, Writer has targeted Fortune 500 companies since its 2020 founding. \"We&#x27;re not a research lab that went to consumer and is dabbling in enterprise,\" Shetrit said. \"We are first and foremost targeting the Global 2000 and Fortune 500, and our research is in service of these customers&#x27; needs.\"Inside Writer&#x27;s strategy to connect AI agents across enterprise software systemsA critical technical component is Writer&#x27;s approach to system integrations. The platform includes pre-built connectors to more than a dozen enterprise applications—Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Snowflake, Asana, Slack, Gong, HubSpot, Atlassian, Databricks, PitchBook, and FactSet—allowing the AI to retrieve information and take actions across those systems.Writer built these connectors using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI system integrations, but added what Shetrit described as an \"enterprise-ready\" layer on top.\"We took a first-principle approach of: You have this MCP connector infrastructure—how do you build it in a way that&#x27;s enterprise-ready?\" Shetrit explained. \"What we have today in the industry is definitely not it.\"The system can write and execute code on the fly to handle unexpected scenarios. If a user uploads an unfamiliar file format, for instance, the agent will generate code to extract and process the text without requiring a human to intervene.Jwo demonstrated this capability with a daily workflow she runs: Every morning at 10 a.m., a Routine automatically summarizes her Google Calendar meetings, identifies external participants, finds their LinkedIn profiles, and sends the summary to her via Slack — all without her involvement.\"This was pretty simple, but you can imagine for a salesperson it might say, &#x27;At the end of the day, wrap up a summary of all the calls I had, send me action items, post it to the account-specific Slack channel, and tag these folks so they can accomplish those workflows,&#x27;\" Jwo said. \"That can run continuously each day, each week, or on demand.\"From mortgage lenders to CPG brands: Real-world AI agent use cases across industriesThe platform is attracting customers across multiple industries. New American Funding, a mortgage lender, uses Writer Agent to automate marketing workflows. Senior Content Marketing Manager Karen Rodriguez uploads Asana project tickets with creative briefs, and the AI executes tasks like updating email campaigns or transforming articles into social media carousels, video scripts, and captions.Other use cases span financial services teams creating investment dashboards with PitchBook and FactSet data, consumer packaged goods companies brainstorming new product lines based on social media trends, and marketing teams generating partnership presentations with branded assets.Writer has added customers including TikTok, Comcast, Keurig Dr Pepper, CAA, and Aptitude Health, joining an existing base that includes Accenture, Qualcomm, Uber, Vanguard, and Marriott. The company now serves more than 300 enterprises and has secured over $50 million in signed contracts, with projections to double that to $100 million this year.The startup&#x27;s net retention rate — a measure of how much existing customers expand their usage — stands at 160%, meaning customers on average increase their spending by 60% after initial contracts. Twenty customers who started with $200,000-$300,000 contracts now spend about $1 million annually, according to company data.&#x27;Vibe working&#x27;: Writer&#x27;s vision for AI-powered productivity beyond codingWriter executives frame the platform as enabling what they call \"vibe working\" — a playful reference to the popular term \"vibe coding,\" which describes AI tools like Cursor that dramatically accelerate software development.\"We used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine. That&#x27;s optimizing the world as it is,\" Habib said at Writer&#x27;s AI Leaders Forum earlier this month, according to Forbes. \"We can now create a new world.

          "content": "Writer, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, is launching a unified AI agent platform designed to let any employee automate complex business workflows without writing code — a capability the company says distinguishes it from consumer-oriented tools like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT.The platform, called Writer Agent, combines chat-based assistance with autonomous task execution in a single interface. Starting Tuesday, enterprise customers can use natural language to instruct the AI to create presentations, analyze financial data, generate marketing campaigns, or coordinate across multiple business systems like Salesforce, Slack, and Google Workspace—then save those workflows as reusable \"Playbooks\" that run automatically on schedules.The announcement comes as enterprises struggle to move AI initiatives beyond pilot programs into production at scale. Writer CEO May Habib has been outspoken about this challenge, recently revealing that 42% of Fortune 500 executives surveyed by her company said AI is \"tearing their company apart\" due to coordination failures between departments.\"We&#x27;re delivering an agent interface that is both incredibly powerful and radically simple to transform individual productivity into organizational impact,\" Habib said in a statement. \"Writer Agent is the difference between a single sales rep asking a chatbot to write an outreach email and an enterprise ensuring that 1,000 reps are all sending on-brand, compliant, and contextually-aware messages to target accounts.\"How Writer is putting workflow automation in the hands of non-technical workersThe platform&#x27;s core innovation centers on making workflow automation accessible to non-technical employees—what Writer executives call \"democratizing who gets to be a builder.\"In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Doris Jwo, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, demonstrated how the system works: A user types a request in plain English — for example, \"Create a two-page partnership proposal between [Company A] and [Company B], make it a branded deck, include impact metrics and partnership tiers.\"The AI agent then breaks down that request into discrete steps, conducts web research, generates graphics and charts on the fly, creates individual slides with sourced information, and assembles a complete presentation. The entire process, which might take an employee hours or days, can be completed in 10-12 minutes.\"The agent basically looks at the request, breaks it down, does research, understands what pieces it needs, creates a detailed plan at a step-by-step level,\" Jwo explained during a product demonstration. \"It might say, &#x27;I need to do web research,&#x27; or &#x27;This user needs information from Gong or Slack,&#x27; and it reaches out to those connectors, grabs the data, and executes the plan.\"Crucially, users can save these multi-step processes as Playbooks—reusable templates that colleagues can deploy with a single click. Routines allow those Playbooks to run automatically at scheduled intervals, essentially putting knowledge work \"on autopilot.\"Security and compliance controls: Writer&#x27;s answer to enterprise IT concernsWriter positions these enterprise-focused controls as a key differentiator from competitors. While Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic offer powerful AI capabilities, Writer&#x27;s executives argue those tools weren&#x27;t designed from the ground up for the security, compliance, and governance requirements of large regulated organizations.\"All of the products you mentioned are great products, but even Copilot is very much focused on personal productivity—summarizing email, for example, which is important, but that&#x27;s not the component we&#x27;re focusing on,\" said Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.Shetrit emphasized Writer&#x27;s \"trust, security, and interoperability\" approach. IT administrators can granularly control what the AI can access — for instance, preventing market research agents from mentioning competitors, or restricting which employees can use web search capabilities. All activity is logged with detailed audit trails showing exactly what data the agent touched and what actions it took.\"These fine-grained controls are what make products enterprise-ready,\" Shetrit said. \"We can deploy to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees while maintaining the security and guardrails you need for that scale.\"This architecture reflects Writer&#x27;s origin story. Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic, which started as research labs and later added enterprise offerings, Writer has targeted Fortune 500 companies since its 2020 founding. \"We&#x27;re not a research lab that went to consumer and is dabbling in enterprise,\" Shetrit said. \"We are first and foremost targeting the Global 2000 and Fortune 500, and our research is in service of these customers&#x27; needs.\"Inside Writer&#x27;s strategy to connect AI agents across enterprise software systemsA critical technical component is Writer&#x27;s approach to system integrations. The platform includes pre-built connectors to more than a dozen enterprise applications—Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Snowflake, Asana, Slack, Gong, HubSpot, Atlassian, Databricks, PitchBook, and FactSet—allowing the AI to retrieve information and take actions across those systems.Writer built these connectors using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI system integrations, but added what Shetrit described as an \"enterprise-ready\" layer on top.\"We took a first-principle approach of: You have this MCP connector infrastructure—how do you build it in a way that&#x27;s enterprise-ready?\" Shetrit explained. \"What we have today in the industry is definitely not it.\"The system can write and execute code on the fly to handle unexpected scenarios. If a user uploads an unfamiliar file format, for instance, the agent will generate code to extract and process the text without requiring a human to intervene.Jwo demonstrated this capability with a daily workflow she runs: Every morning at 10 a.m., a Routine automatically summarizes her Google Calendar meetings, identifies external participants, finds their LinkedIn profiles, and sends the summary to her via Slack — all without her involvement.\"This was pretty simple, but you can imagine for a salesperson it might say, &#x27;At the end of the day, wrap up a summary of all the calls I had, send me action items, post it to the account-specific Slack channel, and tag these folks so they can accomplish those workflows,&#x27;\" Jwo said. \"That can run continuously each day, each week, or on demand.\"From mortgage lenders to CPG brands: Real-world AI agent use cases across industriesThe platform is attracting customers across multiple industries. New American Funding, a mortgage lender, uses Writer Agent to automate marketing workflows. Senior Content Marketing Manager Karen Rodriguez uploads Asana project tickets with creative briefs, and the AI executes tasks like updating email campaigns or transforming articles into social media carousels, video scripts, and captions.Other use cases span financial services teams creating investment dashboards with PitchBook and FactSet data, consumer packaged goods companies brainstorming new product lines based on social media trends, and marketing teams generating partnership presentations with branded assets.Writer has added customers including TikTok, Comcast, Keurig Dr Pepper, CAA, and Aptitude Health, joining an existing base that includes Accenture, Qualcomm, Uber, Vanguard, and Marriott. The company now serves more than 300 enterprises and has secured over $50 million in signed contracts, with projections to double that to $100 million this year.The startup&#x27;s net retention rate — a measure of how much existing customers expand their usage — stands at 160%, meaning customers on average increase their spending by 60% after initial contracts. Twenty customers who started with $200,000-$300,000 contracts now spend about $1 million annually, according to company data.&#x27;Vibe working&#x27;: Writer&#x27;s vision for AI-powered productivity beyond codingWriter executives frame the platform as enabling what they call \"vibe working\" — a playful reference to the popular term \"vibe coding,\" which describes AI tools like Cursor that dramatically accelerate software development.\"We used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine. That&#x27;s optimizing the world as it is,\" Habib said at Writer&#x27;s AI Leaders Forum earlier this month, according to Forbes. \"We can now create a new world. That is the greenfield mindset.\"Shetrit echoed this framing: \"Vibe coding is the theme of 2025. Our view is that ‘vibe working’ is the theme of 2026.

          "standfirst": "While there are countless ways to play old video games, endless emulators that eat up ROMs and spew out memories, the hardware offerings from Analogue have elevated the act of retro gaming to an art form. With an obsessive dedication to pixel-perfect reproductions of classic platforms, Analogue's various devices generally set the benchmark for consuming old games on new displays. The company's latest entry is an ode to the Nintendo 64, and that poses a bit of a problem. While Analogue's other systems honored the golden age of 2D gaming, the pinnacle of pixel art in many ways, the N64 ushered gamers into the early, ugly days of 3D gaming. Nearly three decades after its initial release, most N64 games look pretty catastrophic by modern standards. Can the Analogue 3D ($250) treatment save them? Origin Story The early to mid-'90s were a heady time for console gaming. Sega and Nintendo had printed so much money in the 16-bit era that both were throwing everything they could at the wall to capture the fluorescent pink, velcro wallets of the gamers of the day. Wild controllers, endless system add-ons and even virtual reality were in the cards. But it would be the humble CD-ROM that really pushed things forward. Sega did its own multimedia add-on in-house, with the Sega CD. Nintendo decided to team up with Sony for the development of its own disc drive. When that project fell apart, Sony famously decided to continue on, releasing the original PlayStation in 1995. Almost overnight, the gaming world was all about three-dimensional gaming, a landscape that Sega's Saturn was ill-prepared for. Nintendo, though, went all-in for its next system, the Nintendo 64. It not only packed more polygons and colors than Sony's system, but Nintendo finally cracked the code of how to make a truly good three-dimensional platformer with Mario 64. Mario 64 is not only a great game, it became the template for how player and camera controls worked, defining rules that still exist today. The N64 was also the first mainstream console to feature an analog controller out of the box, the first console since the Atari 5200 in the early '80s to have four controller ports and the first American console to offer haptic feedback in the form of 1997's Rumble Pak. Today it all sounds quaint, but it was a truly revolutionary machine back in the day. N64 redux The Analogue 3D has the look of a N64 console, right down to the four controller ports up front. Tim Stevens for Engadget The Analogue 3D is somewhat revolutionary as well, but for different reasons. At its core, it relies on a field programmable gate array, or FPGA, much like Analogue's previous devices (the Super Nt, Mega Sg, Pocket and Duo). An FPGA is effectively a processor full of virtual building blocks, called logic elements, which enable it to replicate any other system. It takes a massive amount of configuration, but the result is pure hardware emulation. Again, it’s the same concept as Analogue's previous devices, just on a massively larger scale. Where the Pocket used an Altera Cyclone V FPGA with 49,000 logic elements, this one uses an Intel Cyclone 10 GX FPGA clocking in at 220,000 logic elements. While Analogue never gave much in the way of explanation, it's likely that the extreme complexity that resulted in delay after annoying delay — well, that and the complexities of running an international business in the tariff-laden minefield that is today's global trading landscape. Beyond that, the Analogue 3D very much follows the same aesthetic seen in the company's previous units: a minimalist take on the original hardware. It looks like a smaller and thinner N64 — one that requires active cooling, by the way, so make sure you don't crowd this thing in among your other, lesser game consoles. It (virtually) supports all the N64's key accessories, like the Transfer Pak, the Expansion Pak and the Rumble Pak. It's USB-C powered and output comes via HDMI, and you'll find the requisite cables included in the box. There's also an SD card around the back for firmware updates and a pair of USB-A ports for good measure. Up front, you'll find four controller ports, with the distinctive circular style used by the N64. But you can connect controllers via USB or wirelessly too, if you prefer. Analogue opted for a another 8BitDo controller. Tim Stevens for Engadget The system's default controller is again provided by 8BitDo, which has created special designs for Analogue's other recent releases. For better or worse, the $39.99 8BitDo 64 controller doesn't imitate the three-pronged N64 style, but does offer all that system's buttons in a more traditional layout. It's perhaps too traditional, difficult to tell apart from Nintendo's own Switch Pro controller from a distance. I haven’t been a fan of 8BitDo controllers in the past. Given the premium Analogue charges for its systems, the 8BitDo controllers haven't risen to that level of polish. This new generation, though, is definitely a step up. The controller's buttons don't rattle when you shake it, the inputs have a good feel to them, the vibration isn't harsh and pairing is quick and easy. That said, I did run into latency issues if I was more than about 10 feet away from the system, or if I closed the door on the cabinet that held the Analogue 3D. That's a far cry from the connectivity of a Switch Pro controller, which I can readily use from another room if I'm ever so inclined. CRT vibes in an OLED era The Analogue 3D and the Nintendo 64. Tim Stevens for Engadget Analogue has made a name for itself by obsessing over striking the perfect blend of honoring original systems while making them great in a modern world. If I may insert one automotive reference, they are doing to game systems what Singer Vehicle Design does to Porsches. But where cars both old and reimagined look great on the same road, vintage consoles struggle with modern TVs. Plug an original N64 into your 4K HDTV via a tangle of adapters, and you'll get a blurry, blocky mess that will make you question everything your childhood self held dear. Even if you go the hardcore route with something like an Open Source Scan Converter or an HDMI mod kit to take vintage analog signals and turn them into modern digital ones, you're still probably not going to like the results. That's because it isn't all about getting crisp signals from console to display. These systems were designed for cathode rays, where one colored pixel bled into the next to create a seamless view to hide many of the N64's 320 x 240 flaws. The Analogue 3D goes to great lengths to replicate that look through a series of filters meant to replicate everything from a consumer-grade CRT to the sort of professional-grade monitor that cost as much as a new car did back in the '90s. Analogue has experimented with these filters in the past, but they're taken to a new level here, with options for specifying monitor type, quality and size. The results are quite impressive, still a bit grittier than a giant-sized CRT would be in real life, but looking miles better than the unfiltered view of the games. You can even tune and tweak those display settings on a per-game basis, if you're especially finicky. Unfortunately, you'll have to take my word for that. The 4K CRT effects don't really show up through a capture card, and as of now the Analogue 3D has no integrated screen capture functionality. That, I was told, is coming later. Back to the future of gaming Perfect Dark on the Analogue 3D. Tim Stevens for Engadget I started my testing with the game that, in the eyes of many, represents the high-water mark of the N64 experience: Perfect Dark. Rare's classic first-person shooter shares a lot of its concepts (and surely its code) with that other N64 icon, Goldeneye. But, in the three years between those games, developers learned plenty of tricks, resulting in a game that really pushed the hardware to its limits. Or past its limits, really. Perfect Dark was equally famous for its uneven frame rates. Expecting a one-to-one recreation of the original hardware, I was surprised to find the game running buttery smooth on the Analogue 3D. How? The system includes a series of tweaking and tuning options, including something of a baked-in overclocking function. By default, it's on Auto, which, at least in the case of Perfect Dark, dialed up the Analogue 3D's power to make up for the original system's polygon processing shortcomings. But the Analogue 3D is nothing if not tweakable, and with a few taps into the system's menu, I was able to turn that off. Now locked into \"Force Original Hardware\" mode, Perfect Dark played just like it did back in the day, a shaky and jittery testament to the overachieving aspirations of Rare's developers. And, thanks to more settings adjustments, I could enable the 16:9 mode in Perfect Dark and stretch the video output on the Analogue 3D, getting a proper widescreen effect — even though the game doesn't output a full 16:9 grid of pixels. Super Robot Spirits on the Analogue 3D. Tim Stevens for Engadget Beyond Auto, you can set the game to run in Enhanced, Enhanced+ and Unleashed speeds. I switched over to another game notorious for its poor performance: Superman: The New Superman Adventures. I initially reviewed this game way back in 1999, and it has since become notorious as one of the worst of all time. It's no better today, but thanks to the Analogue 3D, it is at least more fluid. The game's choppiness is gone, replaced by a too-rapid pace to the uninspired ring-chasing gameplay. Sadly, the faster frame rate doesn't make up for the omnipresent green fog that makes Superman 64 feel so claustrophobic. Neither does it fix the crunchy, murky textures that surround you in Perfect Dark. It's not all bad, though. 1997's Super Robot Spirits, a giant robot fighting game released only in Japan, features untextured 3D models that use Gouraud shading to look a little less blocky. The result looks genuinely crisp and clean on the Analogue 3D.So too do games like Mario Kart 64 and Yoshi's Story, 3D games that rely heavily on 2D elements, which scale very nicely up to a modern, 65-inch 4K OLED, like the LG B7 I used for testing. Unfortunately, there were few games that really popped for me. Much of the time, I was stuck looking at blurry, blocky textures poking out of foggy landscapes that were far less breathtaking than I remembered them 25-plus years ago. Wrap-up The Analogue 3D and the Nintendo 64. Tim Stevens for Engadget Analogue's earlier systems take some of the greatest 2D games ever made and elevate them to crisply defined, high-resolution pixel art. They are gorgeous and charming to behold, which just makes them all the more engaging to play. Sadly, few of the games on the N64 stand up so well. Making these games look truly good would require pushing back the omnipresent fog and upscaling the ugly textures that plague many N64 games. That, it's safe to say, would go well past the point of faithful recreation that Analogue strives for. It's hard to fault the Analogue 3D itself for this. The hardware does a remarkable job of recreating that original experience. My N64 library has never looked better, and I am definitely enjoying digging into games I haven't played in decades, plus a few newly acquired gems that I missed back in the day. But, more often than not, I'm left shaking my head at just how bad these games looked, and no amount of 4K upscaling and CRT emulation can fix that.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html?src=rss",

Where the Pocket used an Altera Cyclone V FPGA with 49,000 logic elements, this one uses an Intel Cyclone 10 GX FPGA clocking in at 220,000 logic elements. While Analogue never gave much in the way of explanation, it's likely that the extreme complexity that resulted in delay after annoying delay — well, that and the complexities of running an international business in the tariff-laden minefield that is today's global trading landscape. Beyond that, the Analogue 3D very much follows the same aesthetic seen in the company's previous units: a minimalist take on the original hardware. It looks like a smaller and thinner N64 — one that requires active cooling, by the way, so make sure you don't crowd this thing in among your other, lesser game consoles. It (virtually) supports all the N64's key accessories, like the Transfer Pak, the Expansion Pak and the Rumble Pak. It's USB-C powered and output comes via HDMI, and you'll find the requisite cables included in the box. There's also an SD card around the back for firmware updates and a pair of USB-A ports for good measure. Up front, you'll find four controller ports, with the distinctive circular style used by the N64. But you can connect controllers via USB or wirelessly too, if you prefer. Analogue opted for a another 8BitDo controller. Tim Stevens for Engadget The system's default controller is again provided by 8BitDo, which has created special designs for Analogue's other recent releases. For better or worse, the $39.99 8BitDo 64 controller doesn't imitate the three-pronged N64 style, but does offer all that system's buttons in a more traditional layout. It's perhaps too traditional, difficult to tell apart from Nintendo's own Switch Pro controller from a distance. I haven’t been a fan of 8BitDo controllers in the past. Given the premium Analogue charges for its systems, the 8BitDo controllers haven't risen to that level of polish. This new generation, though, is definitely a step up. The controller's buttons don't rattle when you shake it, the inputs have a good feel to them, the vibration isn't harsh and pairing is quick and easy. That said, I did run into latency issues if I was more than about 10 feet away from the system, or if I closed the door on the cabinet that held the Analogue 3D. That's a far cry from the connectivity of a Switch Pro controller, which I can readily use from another room if I'm ever so inclined. CRT vibes in an OLED era The Analogue 3D and the Nintendo 64. Tim Stevens for Engadget Analogue has made a name for itself by obsessing over striking the perfect blend of honoring original systems while making them great in a modern world. If I may insert one automotive reference, they are doing to game systems what Singer Vehicle Design does to Porsches. But where cars both old and reimagined look great on the same road, vintage consoles struggle with modern TVs. Plug an original N64 into your 4K HDTV via a tangle of adapters, and you'll get a blurry, blocky mess that will make you question everything your childhood self held dear. Even if you go the hardcore route with something like an Open Source Scan Converter or an HDMI mod kit to take vintage analog signals and turn them into modern digital ones, you're still probably not going to like the results. That's because it isn't all about getting crisp signals from console to display. These systems were designed for cathode rays, where one colored pixel bled into the next to create a seamless view to hide many of the N64's 320 x 240 flaws. The Analogue 3D goes to great lengths to replicate that look through a series of filters meant to replicate everything from a consumer-grade CRT to the sort of professional-grade monitor that cost as much as a new car did back in the '90s. Analogue has experimented with these filters in the past, but they're taken to a new level here, with options for specifying monitor type, quality and size. The results are quite impressive, still a bit grittier than a giant-sized CRT would be in real life, but looking miles better than the unfiltered view of the games. You can even tune and tweak those display settings on a per-game basis, if you're especially finicky. Unfortunately, you'll have to take my word for that. The 4K CRT effects don't really show up through a capture card, and as of now the Analogue 3D has no integrated screen capture functionality. That, I was told, is coming later. Back to the future of gaming Perfect Dark on the Analogue 3D. Tim Stevens for Engadget I started my testing with the game that, in the eyes of many, represents the high-water mark of the N64 experience: Perfect Dark. Rare's classic first-person shooter shares a lot of its concepts (and surely its code) with that other N64 icon, Goldeneye. But, in the three years between those games, developers learned plenty of tricks, resulting in a game that really pushed the hardware to its limits. Or past its limits, really. Perfect Dark was equally famous for its uneven frame rates. Expecting a one-to-one recreation of the original hardware, I was surprised to find the game running buttery smooth on the Analogue 3D. How? The system includes a series of tweaking and tuning options, including something of a baked-in overclocking function. By default, it's on Auto, which, at least in the case of Perfect Dark, dialed up the Analogue 3D's power to make up for the original system's polygon processing shortcomings. But the Analogue 3D is nothing if not tweakable, and with a few taps into the system's menu, I was able to turn that off. Now locked into \"Force Original Hardware\" mode, Perfect Dark played just like it did back in the day, a shaky and jittery testament to the overachieving aspirations of Rare's developers. And, thanks to more settings adjustments, I could enable the 16:9 mode in Perfect Dark and stretch the video output on the Analogue 3D, getting a proper widescreen effect — even though the game doesn't output a full 16:9 grid of pixels. Super Robot Spirits on the Analogue 3D. Tim Stevens for Engadget Beyond Auto, you can set the game to run in Enhanced, Enhanced+ and Unleashed speeds. I switched over to another game notorious for its poor performance: Superman: The New Superman Adventures. I initially reviewed this game way back in 1999, and it has since become notorious as one of the worst of all time. It's no better today, but thanks to the Analogue 3D, it is at least more fluid. The game's choppiness is gone, replaced by a too-rapid pace to the uninspired ring-chasing gameplay. Sadly, the faster frame rate doesn't make up for the omnipresent green fog that makes Superman 64 feel so claustrophobic. Neither does it fix the crunchy, murky textures that surround you in Perfect Dark. It's not all bad, though. 1997's Super Robot Spirits, a giant robot fighting game released only in Japan, features untextured 3D models that use Gouraud shading to look a little less blocky. The result looks genuinely crisp and clean on the Analogue 3D.So too do games like Mario Kart 64 and Yoshi's Story, 3D games that rely heavily on 2D elements, which scale very nicely up to a modern, 65-inch 4K OLED, like the LG B7 I used for testing. Unfortunately, there were few games that really popped for me. Much of the time, I was stuck looking at blurry, blocky textures poking out of foggy landscapes that were far less breathtaking than I remembered them 25-plus years ago. Wrap-up The Analogue 3D and the Nintendo 64. Tim Stevens for Engadget Analogue's earlier systems take some of the greatest 2D games ever made and elevate them to crisply defined, high-resolution pixel art. They are gorgeous and charming to behold, which just makes them all the more engaging to play. Sadly, few of the games on the N64 stand up so well. Making these games look truly good would require pushing back the omnipresent fog and upscaling the ugly textures that plague many N64 games. That, it's safe to say, would go well past the point of faithful recreation that Analogue strives for. It's hard to fault the Analogue 3D itself for this. The hardware does a remarkable job of recreating that original experience. My N64 library has never looked better, and I am definitely enjoying digging into games I haven't played in decades, plus a few newly acquired gems that I missed back in the day. But, more often than not, I'm left shaking my head at just how bad these games looked, and no amount of 4K upscaling and CRT emulation can fix that.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-3d-review-modern-processing-cant-fix-vintage-flaws-160000410.html?src=rss",

          "title": "How AI tax startup Blue J torched its entire business model for ChatGPT—and became a $300 million company",
          "standfirst": "In the winter of 2022, as the tech world was becoming mesmerized by the sudden, explosive arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Benjamin Alarie faced a pivotal choice. His legal tech startup, Blue J, had a respectable business built on the AI of a bygone era, serving hundreds of law firms with predictive models. But it had hit a ceiling.Alarie, a tenured tax law professor at the University of Toronto, saw the nascent, error-prone, yet powerful capabilities of large language models not as a curiosity, but as the future. He made a high-stakes decision: to pivot his entire company, which had been painstakingly built over nearly a decade, and rebuild it from the ground up on this unproven technology.That bet has paid off handsomely. Blue J has since quietly secured a $122 million Series D funding round co-led by Oak HC/FT and Sapphire Ventures, placing the company&#x27;s valuation at over $300 million. The move transformed Blue J from a niche player into one of Canada&#x27;s fastest-growing legal tech firms, multiplying its revenue roughly twelve-fold and attracting 10 to 15 new customers every day.The company now serves more than 3,500 organizations, including global accounting giant KPMG UK and several Fortune 500 companies. It is tackling a critical bottleneck in the professional services industry: a severe and worsening talent shortage. The U.S. has 340,000 fewer accountants than it did five years ago, and with 75% of current CPAs expected to retire in the next decade, firms are desperate for tools that can amplify the productivity of their remaining experts.“What once took tax professionals 15 hours of manual research to do can now be completed in about 15 seconds with Blue J,” Alarie, the company&#x27;s CEO, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That value proposition—we can take hours of work and turn it into seconds of work—that is driving a lot of this.\"When the dean&#x27;s biography was wrong: the moment that changed everythingAlarie vividly remembers January 2023, when the dean of the law school stopped by his office for New Year&#x27;s greetings. He asked her about ChatGPT and prompted the AI to describe her. ChatGPT confidently generated a biography. Some details were accurate. Others were completely fabricated.\"She was like, &#x27;Okay, this is really kind of scary. This is wrong, and this has implications,&#x27;\" Alarie said. Yet that moment of obvious failure didn&#x27;t deter him. Instead, it crystallized his conviction.The company&#x27;s first iteration, launched in 2015, used supervised machine learning to build predictive models that could forecast judicial outcomes on specific tax issues. While technically sophisticated, it had a fundamental flaw: it couldn&#x27;t answer every tax research question.\"The challenge was it couldn&#x27;t answer every tax research question, which was really the holy grail,\" Alarie said. Customers loved the tool when it applied to their problem, but would quickly abandon it when it didn&#x27;t. Revenue plateaued around $2 million annually.Despite ChatGPT&#x27;s notorious hallucinations, Alarie convinced his board to make the pivot. \"I had this conviction that if we continued down that path, we weren&#x27;t going to be able to address our number one limitation,\" he said. \"Large language models seemed like a very promising direction.\"He gave his team six months to deliver a working product.From 90-second responses to 3 million queries: How Blue J tamed AI hallucinationsBy August 2023, Blue J was ready to launch. What they released was, in Alarie&#x27;s candid assessment, \"super janky.\" The system took 90 seconds to respond. About half the answers had issues. The Net Promoter Score registered at just 20.What transformed that flawed product into today&#x27;s platform — with response times measured in seconds, a dissatisfaction rate of just one in 700 queries, and an NPS score in the mid-80s — was relentless focus on three strategic pillars.First is proprietary content at massive scale. Blue J secured exclusive licensing with Tax Analysts (Tax Notes) and IBFD, the Amsterdam-based global tax authority covering 220+ jurisdictions. \"We are the only platform on earth that takes in the best U.S. tax information from Tax Notes and the best global tax information from IBFD,\" Alarie said.Second is deep human expertise. Blue J employs tax experts led by Susan Massey, who spent 13 years at the IRS Office of Chief Counsel as Branch Chief for Corporate Tax. Her team constantly tests the AI and refines its performance.Third is an unprecedented feedback flywheel. With over 3 million tax research queries processed in 2025, Blue J is amassing unparalleled data. Each query generates feedback that flows back into the system.Weekly active user rates hover between 75% and 85%, compared to 15% to 25% for traditional platforms. \"A charitable ratio is like we&#x27;re five times more intensively used,\" Alarie noted.Inside Blue J&#x27;s early access partnership with OpenAIBlue J maintains an unusually close relationship with OpenAI that has proven crucial to its success. \"We have a very good relationship with OpenAI, and we get early access to their models,\"Alarie said. \"It&#x27;s quite collaborative. We give them a lot of really high quality feedback about how well different versions of forthcoming models are performing.\"This feedback proves valuable because Blue J has developed what Alarie calls \"ecologically valid\" test questions — drawn from actual tax professional queries, with correct answers determined by Blue J&#x27;s expert team. This helps OpenAI improve performance on complex reasoning tasks.The company tests models from all major providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google&#x27;s Gemini, and open-source alternatives — continuously evaluating which performs best. \"We&#x27;re not necessarily 100% committed to any particular provider,\" he explained. \"We&#x27;re testing all the time.\"This approach helps Blue J navigate a challenging business model: charging approximately $1,500 per seat annually for unlimited queries while absorbing variable compute costs. \"We&#x27;ve pre-committed to delivering them a really good user experience, unlimited tax research answers at a fixed price,\" Alarie said. \"We&#x27;re absorbing a lot of that risk.\"Competition among foundation model providers creates downward pressure on API pricing, while Blue J&#x27;s conservative usage modeling has proven accurate. Gross revenue retention exceeds 99%, while net revenue retention reaches 130% — considered best-in-class for SaaS businesses.Taking on Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis with 75% weekly engagementBlue J faces competition from established publishers like Thomson Reuters, LexisNexis, and Bloomberg, all of which announced AI capabilities throughout 2023 and 2024. Yet Blue J&#x27;s engagement metrics suggest it has captured significant momentum, growing from just 200 customers in 2021 to over 3,500 organizations today.The daily updates prove crucial. While the tax code itself changes only when Congress acts, the ecosystem evolves constantly through IRS regulations, new rulings, and court cases. All 50 states modify their tax codes regularly.\"Things are changing literally every day,\" Alarie said. \"Every day we&#x27;re updating the materials, and that&#x27;s just the U.S. We cover Canada, we cover the UK. The aspirations are truly global for this thing.\"Alarie&#x27;s ambitions extend beyond building a successful startup. As author of the award-winning book \"The Legal Singularity\" and faculty affiliate at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, he has spent years contemplating AI&#x27;s long-term impact on law.In academic papers published in Tax Notes throughout 2023 and 2024, he chronicled generative AI&#x27;s rise, predicting that \"clients will become substantially more sophisticated\" and that AI would push human experts toward higher-value strategic roles rather than routine research.Blue J&#x27;s $122 million plan: From tax research to &#x27;global tax cognition&#x27;The Series D funding, which brought total capital raised to over $133 million, will fuel aggressive geographic and product expansion. Blue J already operates in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with plans to eventually cover 220+ jurisdictions through its IBFD partnership.Future capabilities could include automated memo generation, tax form completion, document drafting, and conversational history maintaining context across sessions—transforming Blue J from a research tool into what Alarie describes as \"the operating layer for global tax cognition.\"For all its success, Blue J operates in a domain where errors carry serious consequences. The hallucination problem hasn&#x27;t been eliminated — it&#x27;s been minimized through careful engineering, content curation, and human oversight. Blue J has trained its models to acknowledge when they cannot answer a question rather than fabricate information.The business also faces economic risks if compute costs spiral or usage patterns exceed projections. And subtler questions loom about professional judgment: as AI systems become more capable, will users defer to outputs without sufficient critical evaluation?From 15 hours to 15 seconds: What Blue J&#x27;s AI pivot teaches every industryBlue J&#x27;s transformation offers lessons beyond tax software. The company&#x27;s willingness to abandon eight years of proprietary technology and rebuild on an initially unreliable foundation required both courage and calculated risk-taking.The decision paid off not because generative AI was inherently superior to supervised machine learning in all dimensions, but because it addressed the right problem: comprehensiveness rather than precision in narrow domains. Tax professionals didn&#x27;t need 95% accuracy on 5% of questions. They needed good-enough accuracy on 100% of questions.The improvement from an NPS of 20 to 84 in just over two years reflects relentless iteration informed by massive data collection. The content partnerships created differentiation that pure technology couldn&#x27;t replicate. The team of tax experts provided domain knowledge necessary to ensure reliability.Most fundamentally, Blue J recognized that the real competition wasn&#x27;t other AI startups or even established publishers. It was the old way of doing things — the 15 hours of manual research, the institutional knowledge locked in retiring professionals&#x27; heads.\"People are like, &#x27;What does Blue J do? They provide better tax answers. Okay, I think we need that,&#x27;\" Alarie reflected.As AI transforms profession after profession, that clarity of purpose may matter more than technological sophistication. The future belongs not to those who build the most advanced AI, but to those who most effectively harness it to solve problems humans actually have.For a tax law professor who started with frustration about inefficient research methods, building a $300 million company marks an audacious endpoint.

His legal tech startup, Blue J, had a respectable business built on the AI of a bygone era, serving hundreds of law firms with predictive models. But it had hit a ceiling.Alarie, a tenured tax law professor at the University of Toronto, saw the nascent, error-prone, yet powerful capabilities of large language models not as a curiosity, but as the future. He made a high-stakes decision: to pivot his entire company, which had been painstakingly built over nearly a decade, and rebuild it from the ground up on this unproven technology.That bet has paid off handsomely. Blue J has since quietly secured a $122 million Series D funding round co-led by Oak HC/FT and Sapphire Ventures, placing the company&#x27;s valuation at over $300 million. The move transformed Blue J from a niche player into one of Canada&#x27;s fastest-growing legal tech firms, multiplying its revenue roughly twelve-fold and attracting 10 to 15 new customers every day.The company now serves more than 3,500 organizations, including global accounting giant KPMG UK and several Fortune 500 companies. It is tackling a critical bottleneck in the professional services industry: a severe and worsening talent shortage. The U.S. has 340,000 fewer accountants than it did five years ago, and with 75% of current CPAs expected to retire in the next decade, firms are desperate for tools that can amplify the productivity of their remaining experts.“What once took tax professionals 15 hours of manual research to do can now be completed in about 15 seconds with Blue J,” Alarie, the company&#x27;s CEO, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That value proposition—we can take hours of work and turn it into seconds of work—that is driving a lot of this.\"When the dean&#x27;s biography was wrong: the moment that changed everythingAlarie vividly remembers January 2023, when the dean of the law school stopped by his office for New Year&#x27;s greetings. He asked her about ChatGPT and prompted the AI to describe her. ChatGPT confidently generated a biography. Some details were accurate. Others were completely fabricated.\"She was like, &#x27;Okay, this is really kind of scary. This is wrong, and this has implications,&#x27;\" Alarie said. Yet that moment of obvious failure didn&#x27;t deter him. Instead, it crystallized his conviction.The company&#x27;s first iteration, launched in 2015, used supervised machine learning to build predictive models that could forecast judicial outcomes on specific tax issues. While technically sophisticated, it had a fundamental flaw: it couldn&#x27;t answer every tax research question.\"The challenge was it couldn&#x27;t answer every tax research question, which was really the holy grail,\" Alarie said. Customers loved the tool when it applied to their problem, but would quickly abandon it when it didn&#x27;t. Revenue plateaued around $2 million annually.Despite ChatGPT&#x27;s notorious hallucinations, Alarie convinced his board to make the pivot. \"I had this conviction that if we continued down that path, we weren&#x27;t going to be able to address our number one limitation,\" he said. \"Large language models seemed like a very promising direction.\"He gave his team six months to deliver a working product.From 90-second responses to 3 million queries: How Blue J tamed AI hallucinationsBy August 2023, Blue J was ready to launch. What they released was, in Alarie&#x27;s candid assessment, \"super janky.\" The system took 90 seconds to respond. About half the answers had issues. The Net Promoter Score registered at just 20.What transformed that flawed product into today&#x27;s platform — with response times measured in seconds, a dissatisfaction rate of just one in 700 queries, and an NPS score in the mid-80s — was relentless focus on three strategic pillars.First is proprietary content at massive scale. Blue J secured exclusive licensing with Tax Analysts (Tax Notes) and IBFD, the Amsterdam-based global tax authority covering 220+ jurisdictions. \"We are the only platform on earth that takes in the best U.S. tax information from Tax Notes and the best global tax information from IBFD,\" Alarie said.Second is deep human expertise. Blue J employs tax experts led by Susan Massey, who spent 13 years at the IRS Office of Chief Counsel as Branch Chief for Corporate Tax. Her team constantly tests the AI and refines its performance.Third is an unprecedented feedback flywheel. With over 3 million tax research queries processed in 2025, Blue J is amassing unparalleled data. Each query generates feedback that flows back into the system.Weekly active user rates hover between 75% and 85%, compared to 15% to 25% for traditional platforms. \"A charitable ratio is like we&#x27;re five times more intensively used,\" Alarie noted.Inside Blue J&#x27;s early access partnership with OpenAIBlue J maintains an unusually close relationship with OpenAI that has proven crucial to its success. \"We have a very good relationship with OpenAI, and we get early access to their models,\"Alarie said. \"It&#x27;s quite collaborative. We give them a lot of really high quality feedback about how well different versions of forthcoming models are performing.\"This feedback proves valuable because Blue J has developed what Alarie calls \"ecologically valid\" test questions — drawn from actual tax professional queries, with correct answers determined by Blue J&#x27;s expert team. This helps OpenAI improve performance on complex reasoning tasks.The company tests models from all major providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google&#x27;s Gemini, and open-source alternatives — continuously evaluating which performs best. \"We&#x27;re not necessarily 100% committed to any particular provider,\" he explained. \"We&#x27;re testing all the time.\"This approach helps Blue J navigate a challenging business model: charging approximately $1,500 per seat annually for unlimited queries while absorbing variable compute costs. \"We&#x27;ve pre-committed to delivering them a really good user experience, unlimited tax research answers at a fixed price,\" Alarie said. \"We&#x27;re absorbing a lot of that risk.\"Competition among foundation model providers creates downward pressure on API pricing, while Blue J&#x27;s conservative usage modeling has proven accurate. Gross revenue retention exceeds 99%, while net revenue retention reaches 130% — considered best-in-class for SaaS businesses.Taking on Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis with 75% weekly engagementBlue J faces competition from established publishers like Thomson Reuters, LexisNexis, and Bloomberg, all of which announced AI capabilities throughout 2023 and 2024. Yet Blue J&#x27;s engagement metrics suggest it has captured significant momentum, growing from just 200 customers in 2021 to over 3,500 organizations today.The daily updates prove crucial. While the tax code itself changes only when Congress acts, the ecosystem evolves constantly through IRS regulations, new rulings, and court cases. All 50 states modify their tax codes regularly.\"Things are changing literally every day,\" Alarie said. \"Every day we&#x27;re updating the materials, and that&#x27;s just the U.S. We cover Canada, we cover the UK. The aspirations are truly global for this thing.\"Alarie&#x27;s ambitions extend beyond building a successful startup. As author of the award-winning book \"The Legal Singularity\" and faculty affiliate at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, he has spent years contemplating AI&#x27;s long-term impact on law.In academic papers published in Tax Notes throughout 2023 and 2024, he chronicled generative AI&#x27;s rise, predicting that \"clients will become substantially more sophisticated\" and that AI would push human experts toward higher-value strategic roles rather than routine research.Blue J&#x27;s $122 million plan: From tax research to &#x27;global tax cognition&#x27;The Series D funding, which brought total capital raised to over $133 million, will fuel aggressive geographic and product expansion. Blue J already operates in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with plans to eventually cover 220+ jurisdictions through its IBFD partnership.Future capabilities could include automated memo generation, tax form completion, document drafting, and conversational history maintaining context across sessions—transforming Blue J from a research tool into what Alarie describes as \"the operating layer for global tax cognition.\"For all its success, Blue J operates in a domain where errors carry serious consequences. The hallucination problem hasn&#x27;t been eliminated — it&#x27;s been minimized through careful engineering, content curation, and human oversight. Blue J has trained its models to acknowledge when they cannot answer a question rather than fabricate information.The business also faces economic risks if compute costs spiral or usage patterns exceed projections. And subtler questions loom about professional judgment: as AI systems become more capable, will users defer to outputs without sufficient critical evaluation?From 15 hours to 15 seconds: What Blue J&#x27;s AI pivot teaches every industryBlue J&#x27;s transformation offers lessons beyond tax software. The company&#x27;s willingness to abandon eight years of proprietary technology and rebuild on an initially unreliable foundation required both courage and calculated risk-taking.The decision paid off not because generative AI was inherently superior to supervised machine learning in all dimensions, but because it addressed the right problem: comprehensiveness rather than precision in narrow domains. Tax professionals didn&#x27;t need 95% accuracy on 5% of questions. They needed good-enough accuracy on 100% of questions.The improvement from an NPS of 20 to 84 in just over two years reflects relentless iteration informed by massive data collection. The content partnerships created differentiation that pure technology couldn&#x27;t replicate. The team of tax experts provided domain knowledge necessary to ensure reliability.Most fundamentally, Blue J recognized that the real competition wasn&#x27;t other AI startups or even established publishers. It was the old way of doing things — the 15 hours of manual research, the institutional knowledge locked in retiring professionals&#x27; heads.\"People are like, &#x27;What does Blue J do? They provide better tax answers. Okay, I think we need that,&#x27;\" Alarie reflected.As AI transforms profession after profession, that clarity of purpose may matter more than technological sophistication. The future belongs not to those who build the most advanced AI, but to those who most effectively harness it to solve problems humans actually have.For a tax law professor who started with frustration about inefficient research methods, building a $300 million company marks an audacious endpoint. For the thousands of professionals now answering complex questions in 15 seconds instead of 15 hours, it represents the future of their profession, arriving faster than most expected.The bet on ChatGPT when it was still hallucinating biographies has become a validation that sometimes the riskiest move is not to move at all.",

          "title": "DJI's Osmo Action 6 is the first action cam with a variable aperture",
          "standfirst": "DJI has released its third action cam in less than four months, the Osmo Action 6. The new GoPro rival offers something we've never seen in this type of camera: a variable aperture for more control over exposure. It also has a new, square sensor (like the one we saw on the Osmo 360) that makes it easier to crop video for social media-friendly aspect ratios. I've had the Osmo Action 6 for a few days and it looks impressive so far. Rather than a fixed f/2.8 setting as before, the Osmo Action 6 offers a variable f/2.0-4.0 aperture, which offers several benefits. When at f/2.0, it allows twice as much light as before. That in turn allows for higher shutter speeds in dim conditions, which reduces the motion blur that can hurt image quality and stabilization. It also delivers shallower depth of field to help separate the subject from the background. On sunny days, meanwhile, changing the aperture to f/4.0 lets you lower the shutter speed so video looks less staccato and more natural. Steve Dent for Engadget Oddly, DJI doesn't let you fully control the f-stop, however. You can either choose a fixed aperture at f/2.8, or Auto aperture with a range of ISOs, varying from f/2.0 - 4.0 up to f/2.8 - 4.0. That's unfortunate, as it would be nice to be able to select a fixed f/2.0 aperture, for example, to have a shallow depth of field for portraits. (Note that you can pick an f/4.0 fixed aperture as well to get a \"starburst\" pattern on bright parts of the image.) The Action 6 has a new, 1/1.1-inch square sensor (9.8 x 9.8mm), as well. It doesn't boost resolution as some people had hoped, but does allow for more aspect ratio choices. As with the Action 5, video can be shot at up to 4K 120 fps, or 4K at 60 fps in SuperNight Mode. However, it now offers a 4K Custom mode that lets you capture 3,840 x 3,840 square video at up to 60 fps, for cropping at full 4K resolution in both horizontal and vertical formats. It also supports 4:3 4K (3,840 x 2,880) at up to 120 fps for more cropping options when shooting slo-mo. Steve Dent for Engadget The new sensor is also considerably larger than the 1/1.3-inch sensor on the Osmo Action 5 and the 1/1.9-inch sensor on the GoPro 13. That allows for improved low-light performance, according to DJI, and the larger pixels also boost dynamic range to a claimed 13.5 stops. That, combined with DJI's D-LogM and 10-bit capability, should make footage from the Osmo Action 6 easy to adjust, even on high contrast sunny days. DJI has also taken a page from Fujifilm by introducing a Film Tone function to get six distinct looks straight out of the camera, including \"cool tones,\" \"classic negative film\" and \"pleasing skin tones.\" The Osmo Action 6 also offers a 2x lossless zoom (a digital zoom, effectively), portrait mode and subject centering and tracking. Finally, the new \"Natural Wide\" mode gives you a wider field of view without the usual ugly distortion at the corners. For closeup photography, the Action 6 is available with an optional macro lens, as well as an FOV Boost lens that increases the field of view from 155 to 182 degrees. Sample 34MP photo from DJI's Osmo Action 6 Steve Dent for Engadget From my tests so far, low-light video quality looks considerably cleaner and more color-accurate than the Action 5. In addition, the SuperNight Mode is more useful as shutter speeds are higher and thus stabilization in low light is improved over the Action 5. I'll have more information in my full review, coming soon. There are a number of other improvements as well. DJI has boosted the internal storage to 50GB from 47GB before, so you can largely shoot without a memory card, though a microSD slot is also available. As before, it's waterproof to 20 meters (66 feet) by itself, or nearly 200 feet with DJI's waterproof case. And on top of voice control, the Action 6 now supports gestures as well. With the same 1,950mAh Extreme Battery Plus as before, shooting time between charges is 4 hours at 1080p and 2 hours at 4K, both with Rocksteady 3.0 stabilization enabled and the screen off. DJI The Osmo Action 6 is compatible with DJI's increasingly generous accessory lineup, like selfie sticks, bike, helmet and body attachments, suction mounts and more. However, the company upgraded its Quick-Release Adapter Mount to a dual-latch system (first introduced on the Osmo Nano) that \"can be attached in either direction without mechanical limitations,\" the company said. That's a big quality-of-life improvement over the old mounts, which could only be attached one way. That said, the old mounts are still compatible with the new camera and vice-versa. So what about US availability? It looks like, as with the Osmo 360 and Osmo Nano, that DJI's Action 6 won't be available on the company's US store, but it will be sold at Amazon, B&H Photo Video and other third-party resellers, with pricing tba. In Europe, the Osmo Action 6 is now available at DJI's store and Amazon at €379 for the standard combo with one battery, or €479 in the Adventure Combo that includes three batteries and the Battery Case 3 charger.

          "title": "The best air purifier for 2025",
          "standfirst": "We’ve tested more than a dozen air purifiers that range from $120 to $1,200 — but the most effective method for getting the green light from our air quality monitors is completely free: opening the windows. Of course, seasonal allergies, frightful weather and wildfires can all conspire to make open windows impossible. Air purifiers are your second best option. With sound-muffled fans and multi-layered filters, these simple machines can clear up odors, cooking emissions, dust particles, smoke, pet dander and more. We performed simple at-home tests to compare different models, mostly focusing on smart models with app control and auto modes. We compared the features, designs and prices to help you find the best air purifier for your home. Table of contents Best air purifiers for 2025 What an air purifier can and can’t do What to look for in an air purifier Other air purifiers we tested How we test air purifiers Air purifier FAQs Best air purifiers for 2025 What an air purifier can and can’t do There are three key categories of air pollution that adversely affect the quality of the air you breathe: volatile organic compounds (VOC), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and carbon dioxide. VOCs are emitted gasses that can come from cleaners, off-gassing plastics, paint, solvents, fragrances, cooking food and, ironically, air fresheners. VOCs are most closely related to odors you can smell. High levels can irritate your breathing passages, cause headaches and may become cancer-causing over time. Air purifiers with activated charcoal components can help clean VOCs from the air. Particulate matter is usually discussed as PM2.5 and PM10, with the numbers indicating particle size in microns. This is dust, dirt, mold, smoke and, again, emissions from cooking food. Higher levels of PM can lead to respiratory irritation, allergy symptoms, respiratory infections and potentially lung cancer. Air purifiers that include a HEPA or particle filter can help remove airborne particles from your space. Carbon dioxide is what humans and pets breathe out. Elevated levels can cause dizziness and lethargy. But no air purifier can reduce CO2 levels because the molecules are so small. Plants can help to some extent, but really the only solution is opening a window or otherwise ventilating the space. There are no federal standards for air purifiers, but the state of California does require all air cleaners sold in the state to be certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). All of our top picks here have met that certification. What to look for in an air purifier HEPA filters and other filter types An air purifier isn’t an overly complicated device. Smart modes and app connectivity aside, they’re not much more than a filter and a fan, which you can certainly DIY. The fan pulls air through the filter to capture particulate matter and other unhealthy elements so you don’t breathe them in. The type of fan can make some difference — it should be powerful enough to pull in air quickly, but also quiet enough on its low speed so it can unobtrusively clean all day long. Filters, on the other hand, are more varied. Most have two or more layers, typically a pre-filter, an activated carbon filter and sometimes a particle or even a true HEPA filter. The pre-filter is made from a fine mesh that captures big stuff like pet hair and larger chunks of dust. Sometimes this part is separate from the more technical filters — which means you can remove and clean it without needing to swap out the whole thing. For all-in-one filters, you can vacuum the outside of it to remove larger particles. An activated carbon or activated charcoal layer is extremely porous, tightly packed coal that presents a vast amount of microscopic surface area to the passing air. Gaseous chemicals, VOCs and other molecules become lodged in the crannys and stick. This is the layer that gets rid of odors. Nearly all types of air purifiers include a particle filter. Some of those can be called \"true HEPA\" (high-efficiency particulate air) filters — meaning they conform to the standards set out by the DOE. Particle filters are made up of pleated masses of ultrafine fibers that force air to take a convoluted path in order to pass through. This traps and absorbs tiny molecules of smoke and dust, allergens like dander and pollen, and some viruses and bacteria. Since all of these air filters physically trap particulates, they’ll eventually fill up and become less effective. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every six months, while others claim a year-long life span. Most smart air purifiers will let you know in the app when it’s time to replace. When you’re considering a unit’s cost, be sure to factor in the expense of replacement filters, which you may end up buying twice a year. Room size Air purifiers list their air filtration capabilities in terms of room size and frequency of air exchanges, sometimes listed as clean air delivery rate (CADR) or you may see a number for cubic feet per minute (CFM). A smaller unit might say it can exchange the air in a 500-square-foot room twice per hour. So that model should be able to pass all of the air in a 250-square-foot room through the filter every 15 minutes, but a 1,000-square-foot room would probably be outside its effective range. Of course, there’s no standard for manufacturers to adhere to when it comes to these calculations, but typically, larger air purifiers can handle large rooms. Controls In our testing, we focused on Wi-Fi-connected “smart” air purifiers with companion apps that can monitor air quality and adjust the fan settings as needed. Within the apps, you can control auto-clean settings, set timers and schedules and check the health of the filter as well. Most will remind you when it’s time to get a replacement, and let you order one directly from the manufacturer through the app. You can also see the current and historical readings from the internal air quality (AQ) sensor. Most determine air quality through an optical particle meter, though some brands like Dyson and Molekule also include chemical sensors for VOC measurements. When levels of particulates become elevated, the fans switch up to high speed to move more air through until the quality improves. Most smart purifiers also work with voice assistants, so if asking Alexa to turn on your air purifier makes your life easier in some way, you can do so. If you don’t want to talk to an AI or grab your phone to control your purifier, getting a unit with simple on-board controls is a good idea. These can be as basic as buttons with indicator lights or as elaborate as a touchscreen panel. At minimum, it’s good to have a way to control the fan speed and turn on or off auto mode on the device itself. Design As we mentioned, sticking the device as close to the middle of the room is helpful for getting the best performance. That means you’ll be looking at it a lot, so design considerations matter. Most purifiers are cylindrical towers with fan vents up top. Units meant for larger rooms are not small, weighing between 12 and 20 pounds and reaching two feet tall (or in the case of the Dyson Purifier Cool, three and a half feet). Some, like Coway’s Airmega IconS, take on more furniture-like designs to blend in. Others, like Dyson's, are conspicuously designed to stand out. How to set up an air purifier Even the best air purifier can’t do much without airflow. So ideally, you won’t shove your air purifier off in a corner right next to a wall. Most manufacturers recommend at least a foot of clearance between the machine and anything that could block circulation — walls, couches, cabinets and the like. Most cylindrical models have intake vents all around the outside, but box models may have them on just one side, so make sure you point the vents outwards towards the center of the room. Smaller air purifiers work better if they’re up off the ground by a couple feet, such as on top of a stool or end table. And of course, make sure the cord isn’t stretching across trafficked areas to avoid tripping. Before you plug your air purifier in, make sure to check that the filter isn’t wrapped in plastic inside the machine. I probably don’t need to tell you how I know this is a very important first step. The purifiers we recommend are smart home models, so the next step will usually involve downloading the manufacturer’s app to your phone and connecting the air purifier to the app as well as your home’s Wi-Fi. Additional steps for clearing the air Air purifiers, as the name suggests, clean the air. Once dust, dander and smoke settle onto surfaces, there isn’t much these machines can do to eradicate them. So vacuuming and good old-fashioned dusting are important steps to keep allergens and particulate matter at bay. If you have an HVAC system, changing or even upgrading your system’s air filters can help keep bad air in check. The American Lung Association recommends filters with at least a MERV-13 rating. The association also recommends not burning candles in your home, foregoing air fresheners and opting for homemade cleaning supplies over chemical cleaners. When an air purifier just isn’t enough The most striking bit of knowledge I picked up from testing air purifiers is how effective opening windows can be on indoor air quality. What took an air purifier a half hour to clear out took mere minutes when I opened my front door and a few windows. Every variable measured by the air quality sensors, including VOCs, PM, and particularly CO2 levels (which air purifiers can’t alleviate), improved dramatically after exposure to fresh air — significantly faster and better than any machine we tested. Letting in fresh air for just fifteen minutes each day can help, according to the Lung Association. On very cold days, do it midday. When it’s hot, open windows in the early morning when it’s coolest. When I did it in the middle of winter, my HVAC system had to work a little overtime afterwards, but venting a room was the most surefire way of getting air quality quickly back in the green. Of course, if the air outside is unhealthy from wildfire smoke or run-of-the-mill pollution, or if you're dealing with seasonal allergies, throwing open the windows won’t work and an air purifier might be the best way to consistently clean things up. How we test air purifiers My living room is not a science lab; there’s far too much pet hair for that to be the case. Still, I went beyond just turning stuff on and sniffing the air by acquiring two consumer-grade indoor air quality monitors that performed well in laboratory assessments, the Element from Awair and the uHoo Smart Air Monitor. I conducted burn tests in this medium-sized room by measuring the ambient air quality, then burned a brick of piñon incense for twenty minutes and measured the air again. Then I ran one purifier at its highest speed for thirty minutes and recorded levels, then ran the unit on the lowest setting for a half hour and remeasured. I made note of the sound levels using a simple iPhone app to compare one machine’s noise level to the next. Over the course of a month, I used each unit in different scenarios (such as in the basements where the cat litter box is) and tried out each device’s smart features, controls and auto modes. I also just lived with them and evaluated how they fit into everyday life. As new purifiers come on the market we continue to acquire units that seem worthy of inclusion. Most recently, we tested purifiers from Blueair, IQAir, Windmill and others, adding our findings to this guide. Other air purifiers we tested Blueair Mini Restful I appreciate a good multi-tasker. The Blueair Mini Restful combines a small-room air purifier with a sunrise alarm clock and night light. It reminds me of a grown up version of Levoit’s Sprout purifier, which is geared towards kids with its white noise and night light functions. The Mini Restful is definitely small enough to pop on a night stand so it would be pretty handy if it could replace your alarm clock up there. Unfortunately, those secondary functions feel a little incomplete. There’s no timer function for the night light, only manual control. The clock readout is on the top, making it impossible to view from bed if it's on your nightstand. The sunrise alarm clock will start lighting up at either 15 minutes or a half hour before the sound kicks in, but if the light happens to be enough to wake you, there’s no way to stop the alarm from sounding without getting out your phone. It performed well enough in its primary function, and got a smoky bedroom back to breathable in around a half an hour of running on high. (There’s no built-in sensor, so you have to manually adjust the fan through the app or onboard controls.) It’s also quiet enough to run all night on low — I’m fairly sensitive to noise and was able to sleep. IQAir HealthPro Plus SE The IQAir HealthPro Plus SE is a formidable piece of equipment. The boxy tower looks like something you’d see in a hospital and weighs 35 pounds, making me appreciate the included wheels when I needed to move it around. It’s designed and made in Sweden and each unit comes with an impressive certificate of performance. I’m certain the testing processes IQAir employs are more scientific than my tests — after all, the company is probably best known for its air quality monitors — but I found the filtration efficiency to be on par with and, in one test, worse than that of other models I tested. I was also disappointed that a $1,000-plus air purifier from an air monitor device company was only capable of measuring particulate matter — and not VOCs — to trigger the auto-clean function. That said, setup was simple and the app can integrate data from public air quality sources as well as other AQ monitors you may have set up. Coway’s Airmega Icon S Coway’s Airmega Icon S was our previous pick for best design. It looks more like a tiny mid-century-modern credenza than an air purifier and the little shelf up top doubles as a wireless phone charger. The PM2.5 sensor reliably kicked in the auto mode as I used it and the three-speed fan is quiet, even on high, yet powerful. I had a little trouble getting the app to connect, but the onboard touch controls worked better anyway. It’s expensive at $699, too, but it does have a washable pre-filter. Sensibo Pure At $229, and nearly always on sale for $130, I had the Sensibo Pure pegged as a contender for a budget pick. Unfortunately, replacement filters are $99 unless you subscribe to automatic shipments and many of the app features are behind a paywall as well. It’s not certified by CARB and underperformed many of the other units in the burn test, though it did return the air back to a “good” rating according to the air monitors after 30 minutes. The design is inoffensive, it’s not overly loud and it does integrate with Sensibo’s smart AC devices, so if you’re already happy with one of those, this may be a decent option. Dyson Purifier Cool Like all Dyson products, this air purifier is dripping with design. It looks like no other unit on the market and it’s up to you to decide whether you like that or not. I was indifferent to the looks, but appreciated the slick and informative app, which not only displays indoor air quality, it also shows what conditions are like outside, using a clever house graphic to differentiate the two sets of numbers. I also like that it detects VOCs as well as particulates and the auto mode seemed to read the room accurately. The air coming out of the fan did indeed feel cool, though at first had a strong plastic odor. Unfortunately, it was the lowest performing unit during two separate burn tests and had repeated connectivity issues. Molekule Air Pro The Molekule Air Pro comes from a brand that pays keen attention to aesthetics. It and the app have that Instagrammable, muted-modern look that countless clothing and bedsheet brands emulate these days. That style doesn’t come cheap as the Air Pro costs over $1,000 and requires $140 filters. The company came under fire for and had to stop making many of its claims about its filtration system, which may have led to it filing for bankruptcy in 2023. Molekule is still able to tout its patented photoelectrochemical oxidation, which the company says destroys pollutants at a “molecular level.” In my tests, it performed almost as well as the others in improving VOC and PM2.5 levels. But it’s also very loud: When auto mode kicked the fan into high gear, it would make me tense. Also, I found the unit often indicated “bad” or “very bad” levels when my two monitors indicated the air quality was actually pretty good. Air purifier FAQs What settings should you run an air purifier on? There aren’t many settings to adjust on an air purifier. Most have low, medium and high fan speeds and possibly an auto-mode that detects impurities in the air and increases the fan speed on your behalf. Air circulates through a purifier faster at higher fan-speed settings so it cleans the air more efficiently. Higher speeds also make the air purifier louder. That means you typically want to find the balance between cleaning power and noise levels. Other settings like timers and dimming the LED lights make the unit more comfortable to live with, particularly if you use yours in your bedroom. For everyday cleaning of the air, you’re probably best off leaving the air purifier running on low, only kicking it up to high at certain times when the air is murkier, like after you cook. What is a HEPA filter? A HEPA filter is a type of particle filter. Every air purifier has a particle filter, but not all are considered “true HEPA” filters. The specifications are determined by the US Department of Energy and require a minimum efficiency of 99.97 percent when filtering airborne particles of 0.3 microns. HEPA filters can remove dust, pollen, mold and bacteria.

The Mini Restful is definitely small enough to pop on a night stand so it would be pretty handy if it could replace your alarm clock up there. Unfortunately, those secondary functions feel a little incomplete. There’s no timer function for the night light, only manual control. The clock readout is on the top, making it impossible to view from bed if it's on your nightstand. The sunrise alarm clock will start lighting up at either 15 minutes or a half hour before the sound kicks in, but if the light happens to be enough to wake you, there’s no way to stop the alarm from sounding without getting out your phone. It performed well enough in its primary function, and got a smoky bedroom back to breathable in around a half an hour of running on high. (There’s no built-in sensor, so you have to manually adjust the fan through the app or onboard controls.) It’s also quiet enough to run all night on low — I’m fairly sensitive to noise and was able to sleep. IQAir HealthPro Plus SE The IQAir HealthPro Plus SE is a formidable piece of equipment. The boxy tower looks like something you’d see in a hospital and weighs 35 pounds, making me appreciate the included wheels when I needed to move it around. It’s designed and made in Sweden and each unit comes with an impressive certificate of performance. I’m certain the testing processes IQAir employs are more scientific than my tests — after all, the company is probably best known for its air quality monitors — but I found the filtration efficiency to be on par with and, in one test, worse than that of other models I tested. I was also disappointed that a $1,000-plus air purifier from an air monitor device company was only capable of measuring particulate matter — and not VOCs — to trigger the auto-clean function. That said, setup was simple and the app can integrate data from public air quality sources as well as other AQ monitors you may have set up. Coway’s Airmega Icon S Coway’s Airmega Icon S was our previous pick for best design. It looks more like a tiny mid-century-modern credenza than an air purifier and the little shelf up top doubles as a wireless phone charger. The PM2.5 sensor reliably kicked in the auto mode as I used it and the three-speed fan is quiet, even on high, yet powerful. I had a little trouble getting the app to connect, but the onboard touch controls worked better anyway. It’s expensive at $699, too, but it does have a washable pre-filter. Sensibo Pure At $229, and nearly always on sale for $130, I had the Sensibo Pure pegged as a contender for a budget pick. Unfortunately, replacement filters are $99 unless you subscribe to automatic shipments and many of the app features are behind a paywall as well. It’s not certified by CARB and underperformed many of the other units in the burn test, though it did return the air back to a “good” rating according to the air monitors after 30 minutes. The design is inoffensive, it’s not overly loud and it does integrate with Sensibo’s smart AC devices, so if you’re already happy with one of those, this may be a decent option. Dyson Purifier Cool Like all Dyson products, this air purifier is dripping with design. It looks like no other unit on the market and it’s up to you to decide whether you like that or not. I was indifferent to the looks, but appreciated the slick and informative app, which not only displays indoor air quality, it also shows what conditions are like outside, using a clever house graphic to differentiate the two sets of numbers. I also like that it detects VOCs as well as particulates and the auto mode seemed to read the room accurately. The air coming out of the fan did indeed feel cool, though at first had a strong plastic odor. Unfortunately, it was the lowest performing unit during two separate burn tests and had repeated connectivity issues. Molekule Air Pro The Molekule Air Pro comes from a brand that pays keen attention to aesthetics. It and the app have that Instagrammable, muted-modern look that countless clothing and bedsheet brands emulate these days. That style doesn’t come cheap as the Air Pro costs over $1,000 and requires $140 filters. The company came under fire for and had to stop making many of its claims about its filtration system, which may have led to it filing for bankruptcy in 2023. Molekule is still able to tout its patented photoelectrochemical oxidation, which the company says destroys pollutants at a “molecular level.” In my tests, it performed almost as well as the others in improving VOC and PM2.5 levels. But it’s also very loud: When auto mode kicked the fan into high gear, it would make me tense. Also, I found the unit often indicated “bad” or “very bad” levels when my two monitors indicated the air quality was actually pretty good. Air purifier FAQs What settings should you run an air purifier on? There aren’t many settings to adjust on an air purifier. Most have low, medium and high fan speeds and possibly an auto-mode that detects impurities in the air and increases the fan speed on your behalf. Air circulates through a purifier faster at higher fan-speed settings so it cleans the air more efficiently. Higher speeds also make the air purifier louder. That means you typically want to find the balance between cleaning power and noise levels. Other settings like timers and dimming the LED lights make the unit more comfortable to live with, particularly if you use yours in your bedroom. For everyday cleaning of the air, you’re probably best off leaving the air purifier running on low, only kicking it up to high at certain times when the air is murkier, like after you cook. What is a HEPA filter? A HEPA filter is a type of particle filter. Every air purifier has a particle filter, but not all are considered “true HEPA” filters. The specifications are determined by the US Department of Energy and require a minimum efficiency of 99.97 percent when filtering airborne particles of 0.3 microns. HEPA filters can remove dust, pollen, mold and bacteria.

          "standfirst": "Those looking for a better way to keep track of their finances should consider a budgeting app. There are dozens of them on the market now, and one of our favorites is running a discount for new subscribers. Monarch Money is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50. As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.

          "standfirst": "Google launched yet another coding agent platform Tuesday, this time focused on developer teams collaborating to create agents that can execute complex tasks automatically, in a way that moves agents from being remotely controlled to actually independent.The platform, called Antigravity, is powered by Gemini 3 and is now available in public preview with “generous rate limits on Gemini 3 Pro usage,” Google writes in a blog post accompanying the announcement. Antigravity is an agentic coding platform that aims to evolve the IDE toward an agent-first future with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and an agent-first product design.Enterprises that are already bogged down by a growing volume of code to review, thanks in large part to the rise of AI code generation, are demanding more from asynchronous coding agents. They need asynchronous coding agents to help developers review coding projects, assess the elements, and perform tasks autonomously. For the public preview, Antigravity users can build agents using Gemini 3, Anthropic’s Sonnet 4.5 models, and OpenAI’s open-source gpt-oss. It will be compatible with developer environments running on major operating systems such as macOS, Linux and Windows. “We want Antigravity to be the home base for software development in the era of agents,” Google writes in the blog. “Our vision is to ultimately enable anyone with an idea to experience liftoff and build that idea into reality.”Google said it built Antigravity with four key tenets — trust, autonomy, feedback, and self-improvement — which it says sets it apart from other coding platforms because it focuses on a more collaborative development environment.Key tenets of developmentEnterprises today are either completely transparent about what&#x27;s happening under the hood, or they don&#x27;t show their work and simply split out code. The Antigravity team doesn&#x27;t think either of these two extremes build trust. \"Antigravity provides context on agentic work at a more natural task-level abstraction, with the necessary and sufficient set of artifacts and verification results, for the user to gain that trust. There is a concerted emphasis for the agent to thoroughly think through verification of its work, not just the work itself,\" according to Google.As for autonomy, Antigravity’s main interface, Editor View, mimics an IDE experience, standardizing what an agent might encounter while accomplishing its tasks. The agent is embedded in this interface so it can navigate it. However, Google plans to add “an agent-first Manager surface” that flips that idea around, meaning the interface is embedded into the agent. The Antigravity team built user feedback into “across every surface or artifact,” which will be automatically incorporated into agent execution. This would allow work to continue without requiring humans to stop the work to redirect the agent. With the human developer iterating with the agent, \"self-improvement\" becomes very essential. Its agent can tap a knowledge base to learn from past work or contribute new learnings. Google’s many coding agentsAntigravity is not Google’s only coding platform; it’s not even its only coding agent with an IDE integration or asynchronous capabilities. It joins a long line of Google platforms aimed at helping developers work more efficiently. The coding assistant Jules is now integrated into IDEs, can be invoked via the CLI, and can also run asynchronously. Gemini CLI also works similarly. And there&#x27;s Gemini Code Assist, which first launched last year. However, Antigravity will most likely have to compete more with coding agent platforms like Codex from OpenAI, Claude Code from Anthropic, and Cursor. Some people on X commented that Antigravity looks similar to Windsurf, which would make sense: Google hired the Windsurf team — including CEO Varun Mohan — in July and licensed the tech for $2.4 billion. Varun Mohan tweeted that this came from his team:So far, early Antigravity users have had mixed experiences, with many pointing to errors and slow generation.

Now, Meta is rolling out a new tool that allows creators to more easily track when their videos have been reposted by others.The company introduced a new tool for creators called \"content protection,\" which can automatically detect when a creator's original reel is reposted, either fully or partially, on Facebook or Instagram. Creators who are enrolled will be able to see which accounts have shared their work and will be able to take a range of actions on the clip. Available actions include \"track,\" which allows the creator to add a label indicating the clip originally came from their account. In addition to the link back, creators will also be able to keep tabs on the number of views it's getting. Creators can also opt to block a clip entirely, which will prevent anyone else from being able to view the reel.

Finally, creators can choose to \"release\" the video, which removes it from their dashboard so they will no longer have any visibility into how it's performing.The dashboard tracks instances of reused content,MetaThe dashboard also provides some other details that could help creators decide how to respond. For example, they can see whether the video using their content is being monetized, which may influence their decision to track with attribution or block entirely. On the other hand, if a reel was lifted from an account with few followers, they may opt to simply keep an eye on it. Meta has already offered Facebook creators some of these abilities in the past through its rights manager platform, but the company says making the features available directly in the Facebook app will make it accessible to more people. Notably, the company is only offering content protection to creators who share reels on Facebook. So even though the feature will detect copycats on Instagram, it will only do so if the original video has been posted to Facebook.

The new model only requires a single processing step, which also reduces reliance on costly AI computing systems. AI may not be great at everything, despite what proponents want you to believe, but it is great at predicting the weather. Newer models typically outperform traditional prediction methods, even those that rely on supercomputers. These models aren't perfect, however, as even Google has acknowledged that WeatherNext 2 will likely struggle to predict outlier rain and snow events.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Microsoft has been adding AI features to Windows 11 for years, but things have recently entered a new phase, with both generative and so-called “agentic” AI features working their way deeper into the bedrock of the operating system. A new build of Windows 11 released to Windows Insider Program testers yesterday includes a new “experimental agentic features” toggle in the Settings to support a feature called Copilot Actions, and Microsoft has published a detailed support article detailing more about just how those “experimental agentic features” will work. If you’re not familiar, “agentic” is a buzzword that Microsoft has used repeatedly to describe its future ambitions for Windows 11—in plainer language, these agents are meant to accomplish assigned tasks in the background, allowing the user’s attention to be turned elsewhere. Microsoft says it wants agents to be capable of “everyday tasks like organizing files, scheduling meetings, or sending emails,” and that Copilot Actions should give you “an active digital collaborator that can carry out complex tasks for you to enhance efficiency and productivity.” But like other kinds of AI, these agents can be prone to error and confabulations and will often proceed as if they know what they’re doing even when they don’t. They also present, in Microsoft’s own words, “novel security risks,” mostly related to what can happen if an attacker is able to give instructions to one of these agents. As a result, Microsoft’s implementation walks a tightrope between giving these agents access to your files and cordoning them off from the rest of the system.Read full article Comments",

A House subcommittee moved ahead with the plan today despite the opposition from local leaders and criticism from Congressional Democrats. Under the bills, some kinds of local telecom projects would be approved automatically if a city or town doesn’t rule within a deadline set by Congress. “These bills represent an unprecedented federal intrusion into established local decision-making processes, favoring large broadband, telecommunications, wireless, and cable companies at the expense of residents and taxpayers,” four groups representing local leaders wrote in a letter to US lawmakers. “These bills strip local governments of the ability to effectively manage the infrastructure built on local streets and in neighborhoods, while imposing no reciprocal obligations on providers.”Read full article Comments",

That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus. This is a significant link that hasn’t previously been reported despite persistent questions from journalists and concerns from health experts, particularly in light of Canada losing its elimination status last week.

Now, Google’s increasingly unavoidable AI is getting an upgrade. Gemini 3 Pro is available in a limited form today, featuring more immersive, visual outputs and fewer lies, Google says. The company also says Gemini 3 sets a new high-water mark for vibe coding, and Google is announcing a new AI-first integrated development environment (IDE) called Antigravity, which is also available today. The first member of the Gemini 3 family Google says the release of Gemini 3 is yet another step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). The new version of Google’s flagship AI model has expanded simulated reasoning abilities and shows improved understanding of text, images, and video. So far, testers like it—Google’s latest LLM is once again atop the LMArena leaderboard with an ELO score of 1,501, besting Gemini 2.5 Pro by 50 points.Read full article Comments",

Amazon MGM Studios has released a new trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, which is based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. Weir told The New York Times that the inspiration for his novel came from a planned multi-book space opera called Zhek that he began writing after The Martian, about a potential fuel for interstellar travel. He eventually abandoned that effort and wrote the 2017 novel, Artemis, instead, but aspects of Zhek found their way into the Project Hail Mary novel. As we’ve previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star.

Musk’s robotaxis are a little closer to reality, with a kind of limited service being offered in Austin, Texas, as well as parts of San Francisco. But Tesla might need to rethink its approach to safety drivers after a Tesla rideshare passenger in San Francisco took to Reddit to share a video of the operator asleep in the driver’s seat. In fact, the safety driver fell asleep three times during the ride, which took place a little over a week ago, according to Reddit user ohmichael. In his post, which contains a 12-second clip of a man sleeping and then waking in the front seat of a moving Tesla, the poster says he contacted Tesla to report this behavior but never heard back.Read full article Comments",

The Mac Pro has seen just four hardware updates in the last 15 years, and that’s counting a 2012 refresh that was mostly identical to the 2010 version. Long-suffering Mac Pro buyers may have taken heart when Apple finally added an M2 Ultra processor to the tower in mid-2023, making it one of the very last Macs to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon—surely this would mean that the computer would at least be updated once every year or two, like the Mac Studio has been? But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Mac Pro buyers shouldn’t get their hopes up for new hardware in 2026. Gurman says that the tower is “on the back burner” at Apple and that the company is “focused on a new Mac Studio” for the next-generation M5 Ultra chip that is in the works. As we reported earlier this year, Apple doesn’t have plans to design or release an M4 Ultra, and the Mac Studio refresh from this spring included an M3 Ultra alongside the M4 Max.Read full article Comments",

Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are dubbed part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.” Bezos’ co-CEO will be Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.)

The ruling came in response to a suit filed by groups representing the faculty at these schools challenging the Trump administration’s attempts to force UCLA into a deal that would substantially revise instruction and policy. The court’s decision lays out how the Trump administration’s attacks on universities follow a standard plan: use accusations of antisemitism to justify an immediate cut to funding, then use the loss of money to compel an agreement that would result in revisions to how the university is run. The court finds that this plan was deficient on multiple grounds, from violating legal procedures for cutting funding to an illegal attempt at suppressing the First Amendment rights of faculty. The result is a reprieve for the entire University of California system, as well as a clear pathway for any universities to fight back against the Trump administration’s attacks on research and education.Read full article Comments",

The final trailer for Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was just released, featuring Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc in all his Southern gentleman detective glory. This time, he’s tackling the strange death of a parish priest in a spookily Gothic small-town setting. As we’ve previously reported, the original Knives Out was a masterfully plotted winning mashup of Clue and Murder on the Orient Express—or any number of adaptations of novels by the grande dame of murder mysteries, Agatha Christie—along with other classics like Deathtrap, Gosford Park, and Murder by Death. Craig clearly found Blanc a refreshing counter to the 007 franchise, and he and Johnson soon committed to filming a sequel: 2022’s Glass Onion, inspired particularly by the Christie-based “tropical getaway” whodunnit Evil Under the Sun (1982) and an under-appreciated 1973 gem called The Last of Sheila. And now we have Wake Up Dead Man. With this franchise, the less one knows going in, the better. But Johnson has assembled yet another winning all-star cast. Josh Brolin plays the victim, the fire-and-brimstone-spewing Monseigneur Jefferson Wicks; Josh O’Connor plays a young priest named Rev. Jud Duplenticy; Glenn Close plays a devout churchgoer named Martha Delacroix, Wick’s loyal helper; Mila Kunis plays local police chief Geraldine Scott; Jeremy Renner plays town doctor Nat Sharp; Kerry Washington plays uptight lawyer Vera Draven; Daryl McCormack plays aspiring politician Cy Draven; Thomas Haden Church plays groundskeeper Samson Holt; Andrew Scott plays bestselling author Lee Ross; and Cailee Spaeny plays Simone Vivane, a disabled former classical cellist.Read full article Comments",

The Game Post was among the first to publicize the “Concord Delta” project, which reverse-engineered the game’s now-defunct server API to get a functional multiplayer match running over the weekend. “The project is still [a work in progress], it’s playable, but buggy,” developer Red posted in the game’s Discord channel, as reported by The Game Post. “Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting.” Accessing the “Concord Delta” servers reportedly requires a legitimate PC copy of the game, which is relatively hard to come by these days. Concord only sold an estimated 25,000 copies across PC and PS5 before being shut down last year. And that number doesn’t account for the players who accepted a full refund for their $40 purchase after the official servers shut down.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When the Trump administration brutally cut federal funding for biomedical research earlier this year, at least 383 clinical trials that were already in progress were abruptly canceled, cutting off over 74,000 trial participants from their experimental treatments, monitoring, or follow-ups, according to a study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine. The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in an accompanying editor’s note. In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.Read full article Comments",

The pleas come amid a rash of similar schemes orchestrated by hacking and threat groups backed by the North Korean government. The campaigns, which ramped up nearly five years ago, aim to steal millions of dollars in job revenue and cryptocurrencies to fund North Korean weapons programs. Another motive is to seed cyber attacks for espionage. In one such incident, a North Korean man who fraudulently obtained a job at US security company KnowBe4 installed malware immediately upon beginning his employment. On Friday, the US Justice Department said that five men pleaded guilty to assisting North Koreans in obtaining jobs in a scheme orchestrated by APT38, also tracked under the name Lazarus. APT38 has targeted the US and other countries for more than a decade with a stream of attack campaigns that have grown ever bolder and more advanced. All five pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and one to aggravated identity theft, for a range of actions.Read full article Comments",

But last week the company took a tremendous stride forward, not just launching its second orbital rocket, but subsequently landing the booster on a barge named Jacklyn. It now seems clear that Blue Origin is in the midst of a transition from sleeping giant to force to be reckoned with. To get a sense of where the company goes from here, Ars spoke with the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, on the eve of last week’s launch. The first thing he emphasized is how much the company learned about New Glenn, and the process of rolling the vehicle out and standing it up for launch, from the vehicle’s first attempt in January.Read full article Comments",
