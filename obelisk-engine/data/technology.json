          "content": "Disney has agreed to pay $10 million to settle allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that it violated federal law by misleadingly labeling cartoons on YouTube so it could illegally collect children’s personal data. The FTC alleges that Disney failed to label some videos of its popular kids cartoons it uploaded to YouTube as “Made for Kids” — a designation that makes such videos ineligible for certain features, like the collection of personal information. It’s a way YouTube makes it harder to target kids with personalized ads. But rather than mark individual videos as either “Made for Kids” or “Not Made for Kids,” the FTC alleges, Disney left the default designation at the channel level, so any video uploaded to a “Not Made for Kids” channel would bear that “Not Made for Kids” label instead. The result was that videos with content from kid-friendly movies like “The Incredibles,” “Toy Story,” and “Frozen” would be marked as “Not Made for Kids,” according to the government, circumventing YouTube’s heightened restrictions, including allowing YouTube to autoplay other “Not Made for Kids” videos after the Disney ones finished. That resulted in Disney collecting information on kids and serving them targeted ads on videos that were technically designed at not for kids, the FTC alleges, in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection (COPPA) Rule, which requires parental consent to collect information on kids under 13. YouTube implemented the labeling system after its own 2019 settlement with the FTC over alleged violation of the COPPA Rule. Disney should have known that some of its videos were marked incorrectly, the government alleges, since YouTube already told Disney in 2020 that it was labeling its videos incorrectly, changing the labels on over 300 of its videos from “Not Made for Kids” to “Made for Kids” at that time, according to the complaint. But Disney continued to upload videos with only the default designation at the channel level, the FTC says. Under the proposed settlement, Disney will pay a $10 million civil settlement, obtain parents’ consent for collecting data from kids under 13 as required by law, and create a new program to review whether videos uploaded to YouTube should be marked as made for kids or not which it must maintain for the next ten years — unless YouTube comes up with its own system “to determine the age, age range, or age category of all YouTube users.” If so, Disney will no longer need its own system to figure out how videos should be labeled.",

          "content": "Daily squirts of a safe, over-the-counter allergy nasal spray may prevent COVID-19 infections from taking hold, according to results published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine. In a mid-staged trial, the spray appeared to reduce infections by promising 67 percent, though a larger trial will need to confirm that robust efficacy. The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted by researchers at Germany's Saarland University between March 2023 and July 2024. The study included 450 healthy adults, about half of whom (227) spritzed their noses three times a day with the generic antihistamine nasal spray, azelastine, which can be purchased over the counter in the US. The placebo, meanwhile, was a spray with an identical composition except for the absence of the antihistamine. The two groups had similar mixes of previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection statuses. After about 56 days of frequent mistings, only five people using the allergy spray (2.2 percent) caught a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 15 people using a placebo (6.7 percent) got the pandemic infection. That 4.5 percentage-point drop represents a 67 percent reduction in COVID-19 cases, though the numbers here are small. Still, the researchers noted that the five people using the allergy spray who contracted COVID-19 took more time to get the infection than the 15 in the placebo group (31 days versus 19.5). This could hint that the spray held off some infections from exposures early in the trial. And when the allergy spray users did get COVID-19, they were positive on a rapid antigen test for less time than those infected in the placebo group (3.4 days versus 5.1 days), suggesting they cleared the virus a bit faster.Read full article Comments",

DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals. More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) secured a major victory when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The remedy phase took place earlier this year, with the DOJ calling for Google to divest the market-leading Chrome browser. That was the most notable element of the government's proposed remedies, but it also wanted to explore a spin-off of Android, force Google to share search technology, and severely limit the distribution deals Google is permitted to sign. Mehta has decided on a much narrower set of remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, Google gets to hold onto Chrome. The government contended that Google's dominance in Chrome was key to its search lock-in, but Google claimed no other company could hope to operate Chrome and Chromium like it does. Mehta has decided that Google's use of Chrome as a vehicle for search is not illegal in itself, though. \"Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture (sic) of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints,\" the ruling reads.Read full article Comments",

Rhagobot isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind at the mention of a robot. Inspired by Rhagovelia water striders, semiaquatic insects also known as ripple bugs, these tiny bots can glide across rushing streams because of the robotization of an evolutionary adaptation. Rhagovelia (as opposed to other species of water striders) have fan-like appendages toward the ends of their middle legs that passively open and close depending on how the water beneath them is moving. This is why they appear to glide effortlessly across the water’s surface. Biologist Victor Ortega-Jimenez of the University of California, Berkeley, was intrigued by how such tiny insects can accelerate and pull off rapid turns and other maneuvers, almost as if they are flying across a liquid surface.Read full article Comments",

Reports circulated last week claiming that Gmail was the subject of a major data breach, citing a series of warnings Google has distributed and increasing reports of phishing attacks. The hysteria was short-lived, though. In a brief post on its official blog, Google says that Gmail's security is \"strong and effective,\" and reports to the contrary are mistaken. This story seems to have developed due to a random confluence of security events. Google experienced a Gmail data breach in June, but the attack was limited to the company's corporate Salesforce server. The hacker was able to access publicly available information like business names and contact details, but no private information was compromised. Over the following weeks, Google alerted Gmail users to an increase in phishing attacks in July and August. It didn't offer many details, but many believed the spike in phishing was related to the corporate server breach. Indeed, more people are talking about hacking attempts on social media right now. This led to the claim that Gmail's entire user base of 2.5 billion people was about to be hacked at any moment, with some reports advising everyone to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. While that's generally good security advice, Google says the truth is much less dramatic.Read full article Comments",

We'll be discussing how tech firms are responding to tariffs so far and how looming chip tariffs could pose the biggest hurdle yet in sourcing alternative supply chains. And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech. Before Trump even took office, experts had warned that his global trade war—imposing tariffs on imports of various goods from various countries in a bid to strike more favorable trade deals for the US—risked spiking prices of popular tech products like laptops, game consoles, and smartphones.Read full article Comments",

Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the LaserActive, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side. Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, Dragon's Lair-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).Read full article Comments",

Within the next month, OpenAI says, parents will be able to link their accounts with their teens' ChatGPT accounts (minimum age 13) through email invitations, control how the AI model responds with age-appropriate behavior rules that are on by default, manage which features to disable (including memory and chat history), and receive notifications when the system detects their teen experiencing acute distress.Read full article Comments",

WARSAW, Indiana—The Blank Slate pickup scratches a particular itch for some, fulfilling the desire for an EV powertrain without all the bells and whistles associated with a modern vehicle. Gone is the infotainment screen, the lane-keeping assistance, and, for those concerned about surveillance, a modem. Instead, it's an unpainted modular pickup and can be configured post-production into nearly anything the owner wants. Oh, and it's cheap. This Old Factory For decades, the RR Donnelley & Sons printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, pumped out catalogs. Glossy shopping books from JCPenney, Sears, and—my personal favorite—Radio Shack left the plant and were shipped all over the country to eager shoppers looking for their next mail-order delight. Then the Internet broke all of that. The last employees clocked out in 2023.Read full article Comments",

Curved displays in cars are increasingly common, adding a bit of shape to the increasing pixel overload we face behind the steering wheel. The designers of Porsche's upcoming Cayenne Electric, though, decided to do something more dramatic with the touchscreen that commands the center of the forthcoming SUV's dashboard. Its shape flows between dashboard and center console in a smooth, organic way, with a pronounced bend in the middle. The first time I dragged my finger from top to bottom, traversing that kink, I decided I was going to hate this layout. But a day behind the wheel of a prototype version of Porsche's electric SUV changed my mind. I was left wondering why nobody has used this shape. That was just one feature out of dozens that impressed in this SUV that promises somewhere north of 1,000 horsepower (745 kW) and something in excess of 300 miles (482 km) of range on a charge. It won't hit dealerships until sometime next year, but early impressions are that it will be worth the wait.Read full article Comments",

For the second month in a row, the automaker has experienced a year-over-year decrease in sales in China. According to Reuters, Tesla's sales dropped by 4 percent in August compared to the same month in 2024. That's not quite as dire as July, when Tesla saw Chinese sales decrease by 8.4 percent. Much of Tesla's Shanghai factory's slack was taken up by exporting EVs to other markets. Some of Tesla's stiffest competition in China has come from BYD, but the Chinese automaker has started to experience its own struggles at home, too. Yesterday, BYD reported a 30 percent drop in quarterly profits, in part due to the Chinese government telling automakers at the start of the summer that their price war was over.Read full article Comments",

However, a new champion has emerged to continue the fight: Texas Republican Ted Cruz. He seems an unlikely hero for NASA's large rocket, which costs the federal government more than $2 billion to launch. Cruz, after all, is a self-described pro-capitalist, fiscal conservative. SpaceX and Blue Origin, which are building large and significantly lower-cost alternatives to the SLS rocket, have large operations in Texas. In previous legislative sessions, Cruz has often carried legislation important to the commercial space industry, such as the American Space Commerce Act and the Space Frontier Act. But now that he chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Cruz has made a significant shift toward supporting the SLS rocket and its chief contractor, Boeing.Read full article Comments",

Direct Final Rule is just one of several mechanisms the FCC is using in the Delete, Delete, Delete initiative. But despite the seeming obscurity of regulations deleted under Direct Final Rule so far, many observers are concerned that the process could easily be abused to eliminate more significant rules that protect consumers. On July 24, the FCC removed what it called \"11 outdated and useless rule provisions\" related to telegraphs, rabbit-ear broadcast receivers, and phone booths. The FCC said the 11 provisions consist of \"39 regulatory burdens, 7,194 words, and 16 pages.\"Read full article Comments",

Often, it's independent creators who are making the weirdest and most interesting mods for Framework's devices, but PC cooling company Noctua has just announced what amounts to a fairly major cooling upgrade for the Framework Desktop, at least for anyone with access to a 3D printer. By printing a new fan duct and a custom side panel, Noctua managed to lower the noise levels of the Framework Desktop's default cooling fan by between five and seven decibels, without replacing or modifying any other components. The key is apparently the design of the fan grill, which Noctua also used to reduce noise levels in the Noctua edition of this 1,600 W Seasonic power supply. The grill has a distinctive spiral pattern that allows the fan to move similar amounts of air at lower rotation speeds, which is where the noise reduction comes from.Read full article Comments",
