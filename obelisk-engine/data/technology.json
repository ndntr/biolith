          "title": "Moving past speculation: How deterministic CPUs deliver predictable AI performance",
          "standfirst": "For more than three decades, modern CPUs have relied on speculative execution to keep pipelines full. When it emerged in the 1990s, speculation was hailed as a breakthrough — just as pipelining and superscalar execution had been in earlier decades. Each marked a generational leap in microarchitecture. By predicting the outcomes of branches and memory loads, processors could avoid stalls and keep execution units busy. But this architectural shift came at a cost: Wasted energy when predictions failed, increased complexity and vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown. These challenges set the stage for an alternative: A deterministic, time-based execution model. As David Patterson observed in 1980, “A RISC potentially gains in speed merely from a simpler design.” Patterson’s principle of simplicity underpins a new alternative to speculation: A deterministic, time-based execution model.\"For the first time since speculative execution became the dominant paradigm, a fundamentally new approach has been invented. This breakthrough is embodied in a series of six recently issued U.S. patents, sailing through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Together, they introduce a radically different instruction execution model. Departing sharply from conventional speculative techniques, this novel deterministic framework replaces guesswork with a time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism. Each instruction is assigned a precise execution slot within the pipeline, resulting in a rigorously ordered and predictable flow of execution. This reimagined model redefines how modern processors can handle latency and concurrency with greater efficiency and reliability. A simple time counter is used to deterministically set the exact time of when instructions should be executed in the future. Each instruction is dispatched to an execution queue with a preset execution time based on resolving its data dependencies and availability of resources — read buses, execution units and the write bus to the register file. Each instruction remains queued until its scheduled execution slot arrives. This new deterministic approach may represent the first major architectural challenge to speculation since it became the standard.The architecture extends naturally into matrix computation, with a RISC-V instruction set proposal under community review. Configurable general matrix multiply (GEMM) units, ranging from 8×8 to 64×64, can operate using either register-based or direct-memory acceess (DMA)-fed operands. This flexibility supports a wide range of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Early analysis suggests scalability that rivals Google’s TPU cores, while maintaining significantly lower cost and power requirements. Rather than a direct comparison with general-purpose CPUs, the more accurate reference point is vector and matrix engines: Traditional CPUs still depend on speculation and branch prediction, whereas this design applies deterministic scheduling directly to GEMM and vector units. This efficiency stems not only from the configurable GEMM blocks but also from the time-based execution model, where instructions are decoded and assigned precise execution slots based on operand readiness and resource availability. Execution is never a random or heuristic choice among many candidates, but a predictable, pre-planned flow that keeps compute resources continuously busy. Planned matrix benchmarks will provide direct comparisons with TPU GEMM implementations, highlighting the ability to deliver datacenter-class performance without datacenter-class overhead.Critics may argue that static scheduling introduces latency into instruction execution. In reality, the latency already exists — waiting on data dependencies or memory fetches. Conventional CPUs attempt to hide it with speculation, but when predictions fail, the resulting pipeline flush introduces delay and wastes power. The time-counter approach acknowledges this latency and fills it deterministically with useful work, avoiding rollbacks. As the first patent notes, instructions retain out-of-order efficiency: “A microprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions enables execution based on predicted timing rather than speculative issue and recovery,\" with preset execution times but without the overhead of register renaming or speculative comparators.Why speculation stalledSpeculative execution boosts performance by predicting outcomes before they’re known — executing instructions ahead of time and discarding them if the guess was wrong. While this approach can accelerate workloads, it also introduces unpredictability and power inefficiency. Mispredictions inject “No Ops” into the pipeline, stalling progress and wasting energy on work that never completes. These issues are magnified in modern AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, where vector and matrix operations dominate and memory access patterns are irregular. Long fetches, non-cacheable loads and misaligned vectors frequently trigger pipeline flushes in speculative architectures.The result is performance cliffs that vary wildly across datasets and problem sizes, making consistent tuning nearly impossible. Worse still, speculative side effects have exposed vulnerabilities that led to high-profile security exploits. As data intensity grows and memory systems strain, speculation struggles to keep pace — undermining its original promise of seamless acceleration.Time-based execution and deterministic schedulingAt the core of this invention is a vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions. Rather than relying on speculation, instructions are issued only when data dependencies and latency windows are fully known. This eliminates guesswork and costly pipeline flushes while preserving the throughput advantages of out-of-order execution. Architectures built on this patented framework feature deep pipelines — typically spanning 12 stages — combined with wide front ends supporting up to 8-way decode and large reorder buffers exceeding 250 entriesAs illustrated in Figure 1, the architecture mirrors a conventional RISC-V processor at the top level, with instruction fetch and decode stages feeding into execution units. The innovation emerges in the integration of a time counter and register scoreboard, strategically positioned between fetch/decode and the vector execution units. Instead of relying on speculative comparators or register renaming, they utilize a Register Scoreboard and Time Resource Matrix (TRM) to deterministically schedule instructions based on operand readiness and resource availability. Figure 1: High-level block diagram of deterministic processor. A time counter and scoreboard sit between fetch/decode and vector execution units, ensuring instructions issue only when operands are ready.A typical program running on the deterministic processor begins much like it does on any conventional RISC-V system: Instructions are fetched from memory and decoded to determine whether they are scalar, vector, matrix or custom extensions. The difference emerges at the point of dispatch. Instead of issuing instructions speculatively, the processor employs a cycle-accurate time counter, working with a register scoreboard, to decide exactly when each instruction can be executed. This mechanism provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.In conjunction with a register scoreboard, the time-resource matrix associates instructions with execution cycles, allowing the processor to plan dispatch deterministically across available resources. The scoreboard tracks operand readiness and hazard information, enabling scheduling without register renaming or speculative comparators. By monitoring dependencies such as read-after-write (RAW) and write-after-read, it ensures hazards are resolved without costly pipeline flushes. As noted in the patent, “in a multi-threaded microprocessor, the time counter and scoreboard permit rescheduling around cache misses, branch flushes, and RAW hazards without speculative rollback.”Once operands are ready, the instruction is dispatched to the appropriate execution unit. Scalar operations use standard artithmetic logic units (ALUs), while vector and matrix instructions execute in wide execution units connected to a large vector register file. Because instructions launch only when conditions are safe, these units stay highly utilized without the wasted work or recovery cycles caused by mis-predicted speculation. The key enabler of this approach is a simple time counter that orchestrates execution according to data readiness and resource availability, ensuring instructions advance only when operands are ready and resources available. The same principle applies to memory operations: The interface predicts latency windows for loads and stores, allowing the processor to fill those slots with independent instructions and keep execution flowing.Programming model differencesFrom the programmer’s perspective, the flow remains familiar — RISC-V code compiles and executes in the usual way. The crucial difference lies in the execution contract: Rather than relying on dynamic speculation to hide latency, the processor guarantees predictable dispatch and completion times. This eliminates the performance cliffs and wasted energy of speculation while still providing the throughput benefits of out-of-order execution. This perspective underscores how deterministic execution preserves the familiar RISC-V programming model while eliminating the unpredictability and wasted effort of speculation. As John Hennessy put it: \"It’s stupid to do work in run time that you can do in compile time”— a remark reflecting the foundations of RISC and its forward-looking design philosophy.The RISC-V ISA provides opcodes for custom and extension instructions, including floating-point, DSP, and vector operations. The result is a processor that executes instructions deterministically while retaining the benefits of out-of-order performance. By eliminating speculation, the design simplifies hardware, reduces power consumption and avoids pipeline flushes. These efficiency gains grow even more significant in vector and matrix operations, where wide execution units require consistent utilization to reach peak performance. Vector extensions require wide register files and large execution units, which in speculative processors necessitate expensive register renaming to recover from branch mispredictions. In the deterministic design, vector instructions are executed only after commit, eliminating the need for renaming.Each instruction is scheduled against a cycle-accurate time counter: “The time counter provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.” The vector register scoreboard resolves data dependency before issuing instructions to execution pipeline. Instructions are dispatched in a known order at the correct cycle, making execution both predictable and efficient.Vector execution units (integer and floating point) connect directly to a large vector register file. Because instructions are never flushed, there is no renaming overhead. The scoreboard ensures safe access, while the time counter aligns execution with memory readiness. A dedicated memory block predicts the return cycle of loads. Instead of stalling or speculating, the processor schedules independent instructions into latency slots, keeping execution units busy. “A vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions ensures high utilization of wide execution units while avoiding misprediction penalties.”In today’s CPUs, compilers and programmers write code assuming the hardware will dynamically reorder instructions and speculatively execute branches. The hardware handles hazards with register renaming, branch prediction and recovery mechanisms. Programmers benefit from performance, but at the cost of unpredictability and power consumption.In the deterministic time-based architecture, instructions are dispatched only when the time counter indicates their operands will be ready. This means the compiler (or runtime system) doesn’t need to insert guard code for misprediction recovery. Instead, compiler scheduling becomes simpler, as instructions are guaranteed to issue at the correct cycle without rollbacks. For programmers, the ISA remains RISC-V compatible, but deterministic extensions reduce reliance on speculative safety nets.Application in AI and MLIn AI/ML kernels, vector loads and matrix operations often dominate runtime. On a speculative CPU, misaligned or non-cacheable loads can trigger stalls or flushes, starving wide vector and matrix units and wasting energy on discarded work. A deterministic design instead issues these operations with cycle-accurate timing, ensuring high utilization and steady throughput. For programmers, this means fewer performance cliffs and more predictable scaling across problem sizes. And because the patents extend the RISC-V ISA rather than replace it, deterministic processors remain fully compatible with the RVA23 profile and mainstream toolchains such as GCC, LLVM, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr.In practice, the deterministic model doesn’t change how code is written — it remains RISC-V assembly or high-level languages compiled to RISC-V instructions. What changes is the execution contract: Rather than relying on speculative guesswork, programmers can expect predictable latency behavior and higher efficiency without tuning code around microarchitectural quirks.The industry is at an inflection point. AI/ML workloads are dominated by vector and matrix math, where GPUs and TPUs excel — but only by consuming massive power and adding architectural complexity. In contrast, general-purpose CPUs, still tied to speculative execution models, lag behind.A deterministic processor delivers predictable performance across a wide range of workloads, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of task complexity. Eliminating speculative execution enhances energy efficiency and avoids unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, deterministic design scales naturally to vector and matrix operations, making it especially well-suited for AI workloads that rely on high-throughput parallelism. This new deterministic approach may represent the next such leap: The first major architectural challenge to speculation since speculation itself became the standard.Will deterministic CPUs replace speculation in mainstream computing? That remains to be seen. But with issued patents, proven novelty and growing pressure from AI workloads, the timing is right for a paradigm shift. Taken together, these advances signal deterministic execution as the next architectural leap — redefining performance and efficiency just as speculation once did.Speculation marked the last revolution in CPU design; determinism may well represent the next.Thang Tran is the founder and CTO of Simplex Micro.Read more from our guest writers.

          "standfirst": "Techtober may have come to an end, but our reviews team is still hard at work with this fall’s haul of new devices. Over the last two weeks, we’ve tested two new Apple products, a powerful gaming handheld, some seriously impressive headphones and Meta’s sporty smart glasses — and that’s just the start. Read on to catch up on all you might’ve missed, including our picks for the best of 2025. Apple MacBook Pro M5 (14-inch) When it comes to the new M5-powered MacBook Pro, the question isn’t whether it’s a capable machine or not. The real dilemma is whether to buy now or wait for even more muscle from the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. “If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip),” senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar explained. “But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.” Sennheiser HDB 630 Sennheiser uses a USB-C dongle to bridge the gap between wireless convenience and audiophile-grade sound quality with the HDB 630. The problem is they don’t really look like a set of high-end headphones and the $500 asking price is steep. “As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone,” I wrote. “If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.” Lenovo Legion Go 2 Sometimes it’s better to have a utility player instead of a specialist. According to senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford, that’s exactly what you get with Lenovo’s Legion Go 2. You encounter great performance from a device with a huge 8.8-inch OLED display, but the handheld is expensive and bulky. “Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show,” he said. “While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.” Apple iPad Pro M5 (13-inch) The M5 iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also entirely too expensive. While the new chip offers a sizable upgrade, the screen is excellent and fast charging has finally hit the iPad, this model also requires you to spend more on accessories. “Unless you are going to use it as your main computer — all day, every day — and know exactly what benefits you’ll get from the iPad over a more traditional laptop, you’re probably better off buying an iPad Air and saving yourself a lot of money,” deputy news editor Nathan Ingraham wrote. Oakley Meta Vanguard Meta’s sportier collab with Oakley has arrived, with a slew of features that might convince you to replace your action cam with a set of smart glasses. “If you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like,” senior reporter Karissa Bell said. “The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share.” Other recent reviews In other reviews, deputy buying advice editor Valentina Palladino put the slightly updated Powerbeats Fit through their paces and senior reporter Igor Bonifacic went on a gaming spree with the Fractal Design Scape. Igor also spent some time with the Galaxy S25 FE and I test drove Amazon’s completely rebuilt Echo Studio. Senior writer Sam Chapman compiled a list of the best free VPNs and published an in-depth review of Private Internet Access VPN. Engadget’s best of 2025 In case you missed it, we announced our best of 2025 earlier this week. We made our picks based solely on the highest review scores in a variety of categories, so there’s a range of devices that made the cut. Our editors also explained why each one was the best in its category, so this is a good opportunity to get reacquainted with this year’s crop of gadgets and services. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-an-apple-duo-sennheiser-hdb-630-lenovo-legion-go-2-and-more-120000983.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Techtober may have come to an end, but our reviews team is still hard at work with this fall’s haul of new devices. Over the last two weeks, we’ve tested two new Apple products, a powerful gaming handheld, some seriously impressive headphones and Meta’s sporty smart glasses — and that’s just the start. Read on to catch up on all you might’ve missed, including our picks for the best of 2025. Apple MacBook Pro M5 (14-inch) When it comes to the new M5-powered MacBook Pro, the question isn’t whether it’s a capable machine or not. The real dilemma is whether to buy now or wait for even more muscle from the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. “If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip),” senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar explained. “But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.” Sennheiser HDB 630 Sennheiser uses a USB-C dongle to bridge the gap between wireless convenience and audiophile-grade sound quality with the HDB 630. The problem is they don’t really look like a set of high-end headphones and the $500 asking price is steep. “As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone,” I wrote. “If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.” Lenovo Legion Go 2 Sometimes it’s better to have a utility player instead of a specialist. According to senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford, that’s exactly what you get with Lenovo’s Legion Go 2. You encounter great performance from a device with a huge 8.8-inch OLED display, but the handheld is expensive and bulky. “Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show,” he said. “While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.” Apple iPad Pro M5 (13-inch) The M5 iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also entirely too expensive. While the new chip offers a sizable upgrade, the screen is excellent and fast charging has finally hit the iPad, this model also requires you to spend more on accessories. “Unless you are going to use it as your main computer — all day, every day — and know exactly what benefits you’ll get from the iPad over a more traditional laptop, you’re probably better off buying an iPad Air and saving yourself a lot of money,” deputy news editor Nathan Ingraham wrote. Oakley Meta Vanguard Meta’s sportier collab with Oakley has arrived, with a slew of features that might convince you to replace your action cam with a set of smart glasses. “If you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like,” senior reporter Karissa Bell said. “The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share.” Other recent reviews In other reviews, deputy buying advice editor Valentina Palladino put the slightly updated Powerbeats Fit through their paces and senior reporter Igor Bonifacic went on a gaming spree with the Fractal Design Scape.

          "standfirst": "Apple continues to refine the look and feel of the iPhone with each major iOS release, and iOS 26 places more emphasis than ever on personalization. The one big change is the introduction of Spatial Scenes, a feature that allows you to create what Apple calls “holographic” lock screens. Instead of being a flat image, the wallpaper reacts to the way you move your device, giving it a sense of depth and motion that feels far more dynamic than a standard background. The effect is similar to the parallax wallpapers Apple experimented with years ago, but this time it is more refined, more responsive and built around machine learning that separates the subject from the background in a photo. This effect works exclusively on the lock screen, leaving the home screen static unless you choose to pair wallpapers. It integrates seamlessly with existing customization tools, including widgets, clock styles and color options, giving your lock screen a fresh appearance without limiting your control. What are Spatial Scenes in iOS 26? Spatial Scenes in iOS 26 provides a more immersive and interactive way to personalize the iPhone. Unlike static wallpapers, the holographic lock screen responds to movement, adding depth and visual interest. It gives users more control over their device’s appearance, while still preserving usability and readability. By selecting images with clear depth and following the step-by-step setup, anyone can create a lock screen that feels dynamic and engaging. Choosing the right photo The type of image you select is key to achieving a successful holographic lock screen. Photos with a clear subject in the foreground with sufficient separation from the background process more effectively. Portraits, pets, buildings and landscapes often yield the best results. Images with busy backgrounds, excessive filters or heavy editing can confuse the depth detection, producing a less convincing effect. It is also important to consider the placement of your subject. Avoid placing the main focus near the top of the photo, where it could overlap the clock or widgets, as this may interfere with the visual layering. If you store photos in iCloud with “Optimize iPhone Storage” enabled, download the full-resolution version first to ensure the effect works correctly. Choosing the right photo will save time and improve the overall holographic appearance. How to create a holographic lock screen To create a holographic lock screen, start by waking up your iPhone and holding your finger on the lock screen until the wallpaper gallery appears. Tap Customize on an existing wallpaper or select the plus button to add a new one. If you are adding a new wallpaper, choose Photos and browse your library to select an image that shows a clear depth of field and a distinct foreground subject. Once you’ve picked your photo, a preview screen appears with a small hexagon icon in the lower right corner. This icon activates the Spatial Scene effect. Tap it to allow iOS to process the image. The system creates a depth map, separating the subject from the background. If the icon does not appear, the photo may not be good for Spatial Scenes, so choosing another image is recommended. After processing, adjust the image using pinch and drag gestures to zoom or reposition the subject. Proper framing ensures the subject does not conflict with the clock or widgets. Once satisfied, tap Add or Done. You will then choose whether to apply the wallpaper as a pair, which sets it for both lock and home screens, or restrict it to the lock screen only. The holographic effect will appear whenever you view your lock screen. Optimizing the effect Spatial Scenes are supported on iPhone 12 models and newer, since the processing relies on more advanced chips. Low Power Mode may interfere with the motion effect, so disabling it can help if the wallpaper appears static. Accessibility settings like Reduce Motion also impact Spatial Scenes, so check these if the effect does not display. Restarting the device or selecting a different image often resolves any issues. Wide landscapes and images with a clear foreground are the most reliable, while selfies or highly filtered photos may not produce the intended depth. It is also worth noting that the clock and widgets remain legible regardless of the effect. iOS adjusts the layering automatically, ensuring important information is not obscured by the animated depth. This balance between motion and readability makes the feature practical as well as visually appealing. Experiencing the holographic lock screen Once your lock screen is set, tilting your iPhone causes the foreground and background to shift independently, creating a layered, three-dimensional look. The effect is subtle enough to avoid distraction but noticeable enough to make the lock screen feel alive. You can still change clock styles, colors and widget placements without disrupting the 3D effect. If you later decide you prefer a standard wallpaper, simply hold down on the lock screen and tap the hexagon icon to disable Spatial Scenes while keeping the photo intact.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-make-your-lock-screen-background-holographic-in-ios-26-110049999.html?src=rss",

As always, we have a bunch of new games for you to check out this weekend, along with fresh looks at some upcoming projects and a release date or two.But first, I really enjoyed this week's edition of The Guardian's Pushing Buttons newsletter. The publication's video games editor, Keza MacDonald, wrote about spending a day in a theater playing what sounds like the ultimate pass-the-controller game with dozens of other people. The attendees were there to experience Asses.Masses, which is designed to be played collaboratively. The aim is to help a herd of unemployed donkeys get their jobs back. Audience members take turns to pick up the controller, and everyone else in the room can offer advice. It sounds like a fascinating social experiment.New releases'Tis the season for scares, so of course we have to include some creepy games in this week's roundup. There was some buzz this week around The Séance of Blake Manor from Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury. This is a supernatural detective mystery game in which you investigate a woman's disappearance in 19th century Ireland.To solve the case, you'll have to interrogate suspects and keep track of environmental clues and other evidence. You’ll encounter strange goings-on as you conduct the investigation amid a gathering of mystics who are looking to speak to the dead on All Hallow's Eve. The art style is quite fetching, and the vibes remind me of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes and Blue Prince.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now on Steam. The regular price is $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 10.The Run is a choose-your-own-adventure-style interactive film from PRM Games, Benacus Entertainment and RNF Productions. It's an FMV experience in which you help a fitness influencer (played by Roxanne McKee, who appeared in Game of Thrones) make decisions and try to survive the masked figures who are hunting her in northern Italy. There are 20 possible deaths and around five endings. Legendary giallo filmmaker Dario Argento makes a cameo appearance too.It's neat to see more FMV games popping up (and we’ve got another one to highlight momentarily). The Run is out now on iOS for $10. It's coming to Android and Steam soon. You'll also be able to check it out at the Genesis Cinema in London. A two-month residency of The Run just started there. The audience votes on choices using glowsticks.Solo developer Yannick Audéoud (aka Misty Whale) spent a decade making his debut game, Orbyss, and now it's out in the wild. This is a puzzle game that sees you switching between orbs to solve puzzles — bit like in Cocoon. Instead of a beetle that carries such spheres, you technically play as \"a firefly of energy\" that can bounce between the objects.Orbyss has time-manipulation puzzles and ones that involve drones. Audéoud has included accessibility features as well, such as visual cues to represent sound-based mechanics on screen. This self-published game is on Steam. The regular price is $15 and there's a 15 percent discount until November 12.Death by Scrolling is the latest game from Ron Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse Software. The famed director of the first two Monkey Island games (who has had a hand in so many other great games over the years) has now created a vertically scrolling roguelite.The idea here is to stay alive long enough and earn enough gold to pay a ferryman and escape purgatory. I'm probably not going to jump into another roguelite for a minute since I'm still recovering from my time with CloverPit and Ball x Pit, but I definitely want to try out Death by Scrolling at some point. It'll typically run you $8 on Steam, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 11.Upcoming Here's another FMV game for you. This one is all about taking care of a very, very good dog. Golden Retriever Simple Life features Pichu, the pet pooch of developer Pablo Coma (Rablo Games). You'll feed, train and play with the doggo. Going on walks and learning tricks is part of the fun too. There's no release window as yet for Golden Retriever Simple Life, which is coming to Steam. In the meantime, you can stay up to date on the game's progress with developer updates Good Boy Diaries from Pichu.I've seen Egging On pop up from time to time and I've been looking forward to checking it out. I won't have to wait much longer to do that as it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC (Xbox app and Steam) on November 6. It'll hit Game Pass on day one.In this precision platformer, you play as an egg (yes, a hen's egg) that tries to escape a farm. Fall too far and... well, you can probably guess what happens. Egobounds developed Egging On, and Alibi Games and IndieArk are the game's publishers. Anchor takes the format of games like Rust and Valheim and plunges you into the depths of the sea in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. The multiplayer survival game is slated to support more than 150 players per server and there are plans to expand that. You and your friends will take charge of genetically engineered beings and build a base that you have to defend from threats such as \"failed clone experiments\" and raids from other players. Things will change in this world even when you're not playing the game, so you'd better make sure your base is secure. Sharks are a major factor in Anchor as well. They aren't always necessarily hostile. But, as in real life, they're attracted to blood, so any damage you sustain could spell doom.Fearem is the developer of Anchor, which doesn't yet have a release window. It has set course for Steam.Hi everyone!Yes as ID@Xbox Showcase Fall 2025 announcement earlier, it's coming soon to Xbox PC and Xbox Series X|S too for launch day.We heard that there's no default subtitle loaded in the IGN Showcase, here's the one that do! also thankyou for your support @jokoanwar… pic.twitter.com/xFEuC5F0xA— Separuh Interactive | WISHLIST AGNI: VOC NOW! (@SeparuhGames) October 29, 2025 There's a lot going on in this trailer for Agni: Village of Calamity, which premiered during the ID@Xbox indie showcase this week. In this debut title from Separuh Interactive, you play as Agni, an investigator who undertakes an unauthorized investigation in a remote village. You'll need to solve puzzles and fend off monsters as you try to uncover the village's secrets and find your missing partner.Agni: Village of Calamity is steeped in Indonesian folklore. The one large monster that speaks in a childlike voice is quite unsettling. I'm intrigued to learn more about this survival horror game. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox PC and Steam in 2026.Let's wrap things up for this week with one more survival horror tale. There's often horror in beauty and vice versa (take a look at Silent Hill f, for instance). The Florist leans into both as well. As Jessica Park, you deliver a flower arrangement to a lakeside town. But an affliction takes over the area, causing the spread of flora that snares victims and turns them into monsters. For what it's worth, the teaser in that final shot of the trailer reminds me of a certain sequence from The Last of Us Part II. Unclear Games is taking an old-school approach here as it's using a fixed-camera design. You likely know the drill here: solving puzzles and defeating foes is your only way to stay alive. Finding out information about floral specimens will be helpful too. The Florist is coming to Steam in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-supernatural-detective-mystery-fmv-terror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000853.html?src=rss",

Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $39 (14 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Anker MagGo power bank with kickstand (Qi2, 15W, 10K) for $57 (37 percent off): One of our favorite power banks, this brick from Anker gives you 10K capacity in a magnetic, relatively slim package. The built-in kickstand makes it easy to watch videos or make FaceTime calls while powering up, and the small display on the bank's edge will show you how much power is flowing to your phone. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Shark Steam and Scrub Steamer Mop for $110 (31 percent off): This is a slightly more affordable version of this Shark steamer I bought earlier this year and has become one of my favorite things. The one on sale has almost an identical design and arguably the most important feature: rotating dual pads on the bottom that actually lift up the dirt and stains on your floor without too much extra elbow grease needed on your part. It also has three different cleaning modes to choose from, depending on how stubborn the mess is that you're trying to clean up. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.

In the past, we’ve featured year-end roundups of cool science stories we (almost) missed. This year, we’re experimenting with a monthly collection. October’s list includes the microstructural differences between regular and gluten-free spaghetti, capturing striking snakes in action, the mystery behind the formation of Martian gullies, and—for all you word game enthusiasts—an intriguing computational proof of the highest possible scoring Boggle board. Highest-scoring Boggle board Credit: Dan Vanderkam Sometimes we get handy story tips from readers about quirkily interesting research projects. Sometimes those projects involve classic games like Boggle, in which players find as many words as they can from a 4×4 grid of 16 lettered cubic dice, within a given time limit. Software engineer Dan Vanderkam alerted us to a a preprint he posted to the physics arXiv, detailing his quest to find the Boggle board configuration that yields the highest possible score. It’s pictured above, with a total score of 3,625 points, according to Vanderkam’s first-ever computational proof. There are more than 1000 possible words, with “replastering” being the longest.Read full article Comments",
