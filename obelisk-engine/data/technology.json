          "standfirst": "After years of uncertainty over TikTok's future in the United States, a deal for the app's US business has been finalized. The new US entity is called TikTok USDS Joint Venture. ByteDance has retained a 19.9 percent percent stake in the new business, with the rest controlled by a group of non-Chinese investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Emirati-state owned investment firm, all of which have a 15 percent stake. Dell CEO Michael Dell and other investors have smaller stakes in the new company. The terms of the deal were first leaked last month, after TikTok CEO Shou Chew reportedly told employees in a memo that TikTok and ByteDance had agreed to a group of investors. This ends a lengthy saga and months of slow progress as the agreement was being worked out, ensuring that the app will remain available in the US after years of being on the verge of a ban in the country.President Donald Trump, who had tried to ban the app during his first term in office, praised the deal in a post on Truth Social. \"It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,\" he wrote.\"I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.\"According to TikTok’s announcement, the joint venture will protect American users’ data with Oracle's secure US cloud environment. It will also retrain TikTok’s algorithm on US users’ data and will be in charge of content moderation in the US. The entity promises interoperability, as well, promising that users will still get international content and, if they’re a creator, viewers. “The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8 and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,” TikTok said.The new entity will be overseen by a seven-member board of directors, most of whom are Americans. It includes, Shou Chew, the Chief Executive Officer of TikTok, Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban, Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck and MGX Chief Strategy and Safety Officer David Scott. Adam Presser, who had previously been head of operations and trust and safety at TikTok, is the CEO of TikTok USDS Joint Venture.Exactly what the new joint venture means for US users of TikTok is unclear. Shortly after the deal was announced, TikTok introduced new terms of service for US users. As the BBC notes, the new terms include provisions relating to use of the app by kids under 13 (they are limited to the \"Under 13 Experience\") and that the \"TikTok USDS Joint Venture does not endorse any content\" in the app. The company hasn’t announced specific changes to the app’s algorithm or other core features.Update, January 23, 2026, 10:58AM PT: This post was updated to add a statement from President Trump, and with additional information about TikTok’s new terms of service.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-finalizes-deal-for-its-us-entity-010543484.html?src=rss",

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from the usual $160, and League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. Considering we're almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year. The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once. Last year, League Pass added multiview, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game. Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games. If you're an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US.

          "title": "Samsung Bespoke Fridge with AI review: All the bells and whistles",
          "standfirst": "At their core, refrigerators are relatively simple devices. If you're the type of person to view every extra feature as a component that could potentially go wrong, basic iceboxes are probably the kind you go for. But for those on the other end of the spectrum, Samsung's latest Bespoke Refrigerators with AI inside have more bells and whistles than you might think possible — including an optional 32-inch screen. Editor's note: The model we tested for this review came out in the second half of 2025 and will continue to be on sale throughout 2026. Hardware will remain the same, the only changes will come in the form of an OTA software update slated for later this year that will add support for Google Gemini, improved food recognition/labeling and more. Design: As sleek as a fridge can be If you're into faux vintage appliances like Smeg's retro-inspired models, Samsung's offerings might not be for you. For everyone else, the Bespoke family does minimalist design better than practically any other line of fridges on the market. Granted, the counter-depth French Door AI model I tested is a bit of a departure thanks to a huge 32-inch screen embedded in its right-side door. That said, there are a ton of configurations, including the choice of a smaller 9-inch panel or models without a display at all. The latter looks like a big rectangle, but in a way that Dieter Rams would probably appreciate (I'm just guessing, I don't have his contact info). Other options include setups ranging from four-door models to side-by-side two-door variants or even a single-panel upright model. Glare is one of the tiny downsides of a fridge with a glass front. Sam Rutherford for Engadget On my review unit, the fresh food section is a touch smaller (16.5 cubic feet) than you might expect from a fridge this size, though I've never really felt limited by the amount of available storage. Samsung does a good job of optimizing interior space by providing a number of adjustable shelves, including a sliding one on the right side that makes it easy to store taller items without completely sacrificing flat space for others. The shelves are also spill proof and made out of tempered glass, so they resist scratches and just look a bit nicer than those made from lower-quality materials. I also appreciate how Samsung found a spot between the two crisper drawers for the water filter, instead of just sticking it in the top corner like a lot of competitors. Even with the FlexZone drawer stealing some space, the main section of this Bespoke model still features 16.5 cubic feet of storage. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Meanwhile, in exchange for a slightly smaller main cabinet, this model has what Samsung calls a FlexZone drawer, which might be my second favorite thing about this fridge. It's perfectly designed for storing things like 12-ounce cans and juice boxes, and as someone who always likes to keep a couple of chilled Coke Zeros on standby, it's super convenient. That said, taller bottled drinks may need to be stored on their sides, which doesn't feel quite as efficient. But really, you can put anything you want in there and if you have young children like me, it's an excellent place to keep refrigerated kids' snacks. My four-year-old can go in there on his own without needing help from an adult to reach stuff higher up. Samsung even gives you the ability to set a different temperature for the FlexDrawer, which is a nice touch. The optional FlexZone drawer is amazing for stashing drinks or having a refrigerated section that's easy for kids to reach. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Additionally, along with some rivals from LG, this fridge also has touch sensors at the bottom of each door that let you open them with a light tap. While I still prefer to just grab the built-in handles (which are located both above and below each door), this is a nice inclusion, particularly on a fridge that doesn't have giant handgrips bolted to the outside. My one small gripe with Samsung's exterior design is that its top isn't completely flat as it dips down in back. Admittedly, this hasn't stopped me from storing stuff like sheet pans and roasting trays above the fridge, but it would be nicer if things were fully level up there. Water and ice dispensing: Samsung's Beverage Center reigns supreme I've already gone on record about how Samsung's Beverage Center is the best new feature to land on any fridge in years, so without belaboring the point, but I'll happily wax poetic about it again. Instead of having a water dispenser installed smack dab on the outside of the door, Samsung opted to hide things behind an exterior flap on the left side of the fridge. This accomplishes several things. Not only does it feel a bit more hygienic because the spigot isn't subjected directly to all the germs swirling around the kitchen or a cough or sneeze from anyone passing by, it also simplifies the fridge's exterior design. This might sound a bit weird, but I've always thought that putting water dispensers on the outside of a fridge was kind of like installing a shower in the middle of a room. It's just kind of awkward. Furthermore, by opening the Beverage Center's door, you also have access to one of the fridge's interior shelves, which makes it quick and easy to grab things like ketchup, mustard or any other sauces you might need for a meal. My wife stashes her matcha there, so it's readily available first thing in the morning. Samsung's Beverage Center is one of the best fridge innovations and years. It includes both a water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that refills itself automatically. Sam Rutherford for Engadget But the most important thing is that right next to the spigot, there's also a built-in water pitcher that automatically refills itself after every use. This means there's pretty much always 40+ ounces of ice-cold water (depending on the specific model) that you can pull out and pour. This allows you to fill up everyone's cup in seconds like a server at a restaurant, instead of blocking the entire fridge while you slowly top off each glass individually. To me, it's the difference between an active process where you can dictate your own pace versus having to stand there while the machine takes its sweet time. Plus, if you like infusing your water with fruit or tea, there's a built-in basket filter for that too. The Beverage Center is a truly useful innovation and one of Samsung’s biggest advantages over its rivals, and because the company patented it, it'll be years before competitors can come up with copies. The top shelf in the freezer also contains the ice maker, which comes with an included scoop and the ability to make two difference kinds of cubes. Sam Rutherford for Engadget As for ice, the model I'm testing can produce two different types: regular cubes and smaller pebbles. There's also an included scooper and a dedicated shelf for storing it. Now I will admit that the smaller pebbles aren't quite as good as what you get from a standalone nugget-style icemaker, but in my experience they're more than good enough for anyone who likes variety in their frozen water. My small critique for Samsung is that I've heard the ice trays on other models come with sliders that have actual ball bearings instead of plastic rails and I wish the latter were a standard inclusion on every model. There's never so much friction that anything would get properly stuck, it would just be nice if things slid a bit more smoothly. The screen: A welcome addition to a digital lifestyle The fridge's 32-inch display can be used to write memos or draw, along with a ton of other functions. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, one of the biggest potential objections about Samsung's latest fridges may also be one of its biggest strengths: their optional displays. With the continued intrusion of screens into our daily lives, I'm not here to tell you that you need one more. However, even though I was skeptical at first, I've grown to really appreciate having one on the fridge and I'd argue that unless you're skipping the feature entirely, the larger 32-inch panel is what you want. The main reason is that, at least for my family, so much of what we do is already digital. Things like calendars, shopping lists, recipes and family photos already live on my phone and being able to share all of that with the fridge directly via Wi-Fi is a major plus. Frankly, it's easier to upload a picture to the fridge's display than it is to print one out and post it, which goes double for Samsung's Bespoke line since its glass front means magnets don't stick. Even though I already have a smart display in our kitchen, the size of Samsung's screen, along with support for a handful of important apps, have turned the fridge into a better family hub than anything else we own. Because there's so much space, there's room for photos, memos, the weather, filter status and a full 30-day calendar — the latter of which has significantly improved my family's planning and coordination. You can even watch TV or YouTube videos right on the fridge's display. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The fridge runs Samsung's Tizen OS, which is basically the company's lightweight take on Android, so it's super easy to use. You can swipe left and right to add additional widgets to your screen, play music or even watch videos (YouTube, Samsung TV Plus, etc.) if you're so inclined. That said, sometimes I wish the screen was a bit more responsive, because even though I don't think it's a dealbreaker, after having reviewed several generations of the company's phones, I know Samsung can do better. There are also some settings from its handsets that I wish would get ported over to its fridges — like a dedicated dark mode. When I grab a glass of water later at night, the last thing I need is the entire display blasting my kitchen like a pair of hi-beams. AI Inside: A work in progress with benefits today With seemingly every tech company trying to shoehorn AI into its latest products, it's easy to roll your eyes at the idea of adding that into a fridge as well. And I think even Samsung would admit that its efforts to integrate machine learning into the Bespoke line are a work in progress. I've found that while it certainly isn't essential, the AI features found here can be a handy bonus in the right situations. Bespoke models with AI feature a camera mounted to the top of the fridge that can recognize and take pictures of the food you put inside. Sam Rutherford for Engadget AI Vision is the headline feature in Samsung's package, which uses machine learning and a camera mounted to the roof of the fridge to automatically recognize and record items you put inside. However, there are some limitations. Currently, Samsung's AI can detect 37 different food items like fresh fruit and veggies, along with an additional 50 kinds of packaged goods like yogurt. Furthermore, the camera only records what goes into the fridge's main cabinet, so anything you put in the FlexZone drawer, freezer or either door won't get recorded. Regardless of whether an item is recognized or not, the fridge will then take a photo of the item (and tag it with the name of the food if it can be properly identified). You can then view a list of everything in the fridge via a dedicated tab on its screen (assuming your model has one) or from your phone via Samsung's SmartThings app. From there, you can do things like set names for anything uncategorized or add an expiration date, though I wish the fridge would do that last part on its own. The fridge uses AI to automatically track food that it can recognize and applies labels to the corresponding photo. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In practice, this means you just put items in the fridge like you would normally and let the AI sort things out on its own. You can always go through the main list to see if you have a specific item or let the fridge automatically delete things when you take them out. That said, the AI doesn't get things right every time, because while Samsung's programming does clear things out after a certain amount of time, you will still need to delete food manually from time to time. Thankfully, for items in the door, the fridge can show you a live feed of what's there, so if you're at the store and can't remember if you have milk or not, you can simply pull out your phone and see for yourself. Because the camera is mounted to the top of the fridge, you might not get the clearest picture or you may end up with your hand covering part of the food as the fridge takes a picture as you put items inside. Even so, that's still more than enough for me to be able to tell what something is just by looking at a small icon. I've found that Samsung AI Vision legitimately makes it easier to grocery shop by allowing me to see what food I have at a glance, regardless of whether I'm at home or at the store. Samsung also uses AI to suggest recipes based on ingredients you already have in the fridge. You can even specific things like food preferences and dietary restrictions. Sam Rutherford for Engadget On top of that, the fridge also has built-in meal planning capabilities. This means you can ask the fridge to come up with a dish based on ingredients you already have, and it's surprisingly good. Not only do you have the ability to specify preferences and dietary restrictions, there's a wide variety of recipes it can choose from. On several occasions, I even found that when asked to suggest a recipe, the fridge came up with dishes I already had in mind. Alternatively, it will highlight when you're missing items for a potential dish, so you can grab them the next time you're at the store. This is one of the most helpful features, because often at the end of the week, I find myself with a handful of leftover ingredients. So when the fridge uses that info to suggest recipes that use those items, it helps reduce food waste. Sadly, the weakest part of Samsung's AI is Bixby. In addition to being overeager when listening for voice prompts, which ended up causing a lot of inadvertent triggers, Samsung also put the Bixby icon near the bottom left corner of the screen. That's right next to the sensor and handle for the door, resulting in even more unwanted summons. After using this fridge for four months, I wish Bixby would just go away, and it seems Samsung agrees. Sometime later this year, the company is adding support for Google Gemini, which should deliver a massive upgrade to the fridge's voice-controlled capabilities. A word on ads You can disable ads that show up on the fridge's cover screen, though that will also get rid of the news and weather widgets. Thankfully that doesn't impact that widgets on the fridge's main home screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Last fall, to the dismay of many, Samsung announced that it was adding ads to its Family Hub fridges, including Bespoke models with built-in displays. Now no one likes being taunted with commercials, especially when they're on expensive appliances located in the busiest room of their home. Thankfully, I've found that these ads only show up on the Cover Screen, which only appears after no one has used the fridge in a while, kind of like a screensaver on a desktop. Furthermore, you can disable these ads entirely. The downside is that doing so also gets rid of the rotating news and weather widgets that appear on the home screen. But in my experience, that's just fine, because I don't need what is effectively the fridge's lock screen to have that much going on. Plus, when you open the fridge or touch its screen, it instantly reverts to the main home menu, which includes its own set of widgets that you can customize how you like. Some quick notes and observations For some reason, the door to the Beverage Center doesn't soft close like the rest of the doors do. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The Bespoke fridge’s screen does collect smudges, but so does stainless steel, and it doesn't really impact viewability. And on white glass models like my review unit, the simple design makes it easier to clean and maintain than typical metal-clad rivals. The door to the Beverage Center doesn't soft-close like you'd normally expect on a fridge. It's more of a clack, which isn't a bad thing on its own, though I hope Samsung changes its design to match the other doors on future models for consistency's sake. Because the fridge runs Tizen and not full Android, there aren't nearly as many choices for widgets. For example, there's a widget for Spotify and Amazon Music, but not YouTube or Apple Music. There's also only a single option for weather and a widget for pinning your favorite websites, but very little choice when it comes to dedicated news options. In my testing, the SmartThings integration worked better on Samsung phones compared to standard Android handsets, but your experience may vary. If you are so inclined, you can create shopping lists directly on the fridge and then order them from partners including Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Walmart and others. Wrap-up AI in a fridge might sound ridiculous, but it allows for some genuinely useful features, even if the tech suffers from growing pains. And while this might sound preposterous, I think Samsung should actually double down on the tech by adding even more cameras, so the fridge has more angles and viewpoints to choose from as its algorithms evolve. The ability to automatically track what goes in and out of the fridge makes it easier to both shop and plan meals, and this is just in the early stages of the tech. That said, obsessing over AI is sort of besides the point because even without it, Samsung's Bespoke French Door fridge is a first-class icebox. For tech-savvy people, its big screen helps simplify and organize our digital lives while simultaneously allowing the fridge to be helpful in ways you might not have even considered. It's also well-built and exquisitely designed to fit in seamlessly with other modern devices, which feels refreshing considering how often appliances feel like they are lagging years or decades behind gadgets like phones and laptops. And I can't overstate how much I like Samsung's Beverage Center, which in my opinion, is so good it's worth going with a Bespoke fridge just for that one feature. In the end, the two biggest factors you'll need to consider are price and your appetite to digitize your kitchen, and by extension, your life. Starting at $3,500 for AI-equipped Bespoke models, Samsung's top-of-the-line fridges are far from cheap. Thankfully, versions without machine learning can be had for much less. But more importantly, you have to be willing to embrace technology's role in your home. You may not agree or want to pay this much for features like this just yet, but Samsung's Bespoke AI 4-Door French Door refrigerator has convinced me there's a happy home for smarter iceboxes. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsung-bespoke-fridge-with-ai-review-all-the-bells-and-whistles-140000099.html?src=rss",
          "content": "At their core, refrigerators are relatively simple devices. If you're the type of person to view every extra feature as a component that could potentially go wrong, basic iceboxes are probably the kind you go for. But for those on the other end of the spectrum, Samsung's latest Bespoke Refrigerators with AI inside have more bells and whistles than you might think possible — including an optional 32-inch screen. Editor's note: The model we tested for this review came out in the second half of 2025 and will continue to be on sale throughout 2026. Hardware will remain the same, the only changes will come in the form of an OTA software update slated for later this year that will add support for Google Gemini, improved food recognition/labeling and more. Design: As sleek as a fridge can be If you're into faux vintage appliances like Smeg's retro-inspired models, Samsung's offerings might not be for you. For everyone else, the Bespoke family does minimalist design better than practically any other line of fridges on the market. Granted, the counter-depth French Door AI model I tested is a bit of a departure thanks to a huge 32-inch screen embedded in its right-side door. That said, there are a ton of configurations, including the choice of a smaller 9-inch panel or models without a display at all. The latter looks like a big rectangle, but in a way that Dieter Rams would probably appreciate (I'm just guessing, I don't have his contact info). Other options include setups ranging from four-door models to side-by-side two-door variants or even a single-panel upright model. Glare is one of the tiny downsides of a fridge with a glass front. Sam Rutherford for Engadget On my review unit, the fresh food section is a touch smaller (16.5 cubic feet) than you might expect from a fridge this size, though I've never really felt limited by the amount of available storage. Samsung does a good job of optimizing interior space by providing a number of adjustable shelves, including a sliding one on the right side that makes it easy to store taller items without completely sacrificing flat space for others. The shelves are also spill proof and made out of tempered glass, so they resist scratches and just look a bit nicer than those made from lower-quality materials. I also appreciate how Samsung found a spot between the two crisper drawers for the water filter, instead of just sticking it in the top corner like a lot of competitors. Even with the FlexZone drawer stealing some space, the main section of this Bespoke model still features 16.5 cubic feet of storage. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Meanwhile, in exchange for a slightly smaller main cabinet, this model has what Samsung calls a FlexZone drawer, which might be my second favorite thing about this fridge. It's perfectly designed for storing things like 12-ounce cans and juice boxes, and as someone who always likes to keep a couple of chilled Coke Zeros on standby, it's super convenient. That said, taller bottled drinks may need to be stored on their sides, which doesn't feel quite as efficient. But really, you can put anything you want in there and if you have young children like me, it's an excellent place to keep refrigerated kids' snacks. My four-year-old can go in there on his own without needing help from an adult to reach stuff higher up. Samsung even gives you the ability to set a different temperature for the FlexDrawer, which is a nice touch. The optional FlexZone drawer is amazing for stashing drinks or having a refrigerated section that's easy for kids to reach. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Additionally, along with some rivals from LG, this fridge also has touch sensors at the bottom of each door that let you open them with a light tap. While I still prefer to just grab the built-in handles (which are located both above and below each door), this is a nice inclusion, particularly on a fridge that doesn't have giant handgrips bolted to the outside. My one small gripe with Samsung's exterior design is that its top isn't completely flat as it dips down in back. Admittedly, this hasn't stopped me from storing stuff like sheet pans and roasting trays above the fridge, but it would be nicer if things were fully level up there. Water and ice dispensing: Samsung's Beverage Center reigns supreme I've already gone on record about how Samsung's Beverage Center is the best new feature to land on any fridge in years, so without belaboring the point, but I'll happily wax poetic about it again. Instead of having a water dispenser installed smack dab on the outside of the door, Samsung opted to hide things behind an exterior flap on the left side of the fridge. This accomplishes several things. Not only does it feel a bit more hygienic because the spigot isn't subjected directly to all the germs swirling around the kitchen or a cough or sneeze from anyone passing by, it also simplifies the fridge's exterior design. This might sound a bit weird, but I've always thought that putting water dispensers on the outside of a fridge was kind of like installing a shower in the middle of a room. It's just kind of awkward. Furthermore, by opening the Beverage Center's door, you also have access to one of the fridge's interior shelves, which makes it quick and easy to grab things like ketchup, mustard or any other sauces you might need for a meal. My wife stashes her matcha there, so it's readily available first thing in the morning. Samsung's Beverage Center is one of the best fridge innovations and years. It includes both a water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that refills itself automatically. Sam Rutherford for Engadget But the most important thing is that right next to the spigot, there's also a built-in water pitcher that automatically refills itself after every use. This means there's pretty much always 40+ ounces of ice-cold water (depending on the specific model) that you can pull out and pour. This allows you to fill up everyone's cup in seconds like a server at a restaurant, instead of blocking the entire fridge while you slowly top off each glass individually. To me, it's the difference between an active process where you can dictate your own pace versus having to stand there while the machine takes its sweet time. Plus, if you like infusing your water with fruit or tea, there's a built-in basket filter for that too. The Beverage Center is a truly useful innovation and one of Samsung’s biggest advantages over its rivals, and because the company patented it, it'll be years before competitors can come up with copies. The top shelf in the freezer also contains the ice maker, which comes with an included scoop and the ability to make two difference kinds of cubes. Sam Rutherford for Engadget As for ice, the model I'm testing can produce two different types: regular cubes and smaller pebbles. There's also an included scooper and a dedicated shelf for storing it. Now I will admit that the smaller pebbles aren't quite as good as what you get from a standalone nugget-style icemaker, but in my experience they're more than good enough for anyone who likes variety in their frozen water. My small critique for Samsung is that I've heard the ice trays on other models come with sliders that have actual ball bearings instead of plastic rails and I wish the latter were a standard inclusion on every model. There's never so much friction that anything would get properly stuck, it would just be nice if things slid a bit more smoothly. The screen: A welcome addition to a digital lifestyle The fridge's 32-inch display can be used to write memos or draw, along with a ton of other functions. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, one of the biggest potential objections about Samsung's latest fridges may also be one of its biggest strengths: their optional displays. With the continued intrusion of screens into our daily lives, I'm not here to tell you that you need one more. However, even though I was skeptical at first, I've grown to really appreciate having one on the fridge and I'd argue that unless you're skipping the feature entirely, the larger 32-inch panel is what you want. The main reason is that, at least for my family, so much of what we do is already digital. Things like calendars, shopping lists, recipes and family photos already live on my phone and being able to share all of that with the fridge directly via Wi-Fi is a major plus. Frankly, it's easier to upload a picture to the fridge's display than it is to print one out and post it, which goes double for Samsung's Bespoke line since its glass front means magnets don't stick. Even though I already have a smart display in our kitchen, the size of Samsung's screen, along with support for a handful of important apps, have turned the fridge into a better family hub than anything else we own. Because there's so much space, there's room for photos, memos, the weather, filter status and a full 30-day calendar — the latter of which has significantly improved my family's planning and coordination. You can even watch TV or YouTube videos right on the fridge's display. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The fridge runs Samsung's Tizen OS, which is basically the company's lightweight take on Android, so it's super easy to use. You can swipe left and right to add additional widgets to your screen, play music or even watch videos (YouTube, Samsung TV Plus, etc.) if you're so inclined. That said, sometimes I wish the screen was a bit more responsive, because even though I don't think it's a dealbreaker, after having reviewed several generations of the company's phones, I know Samsung can do better. There are also some settings from its handsets that I wish would get ported over to its fridges — like a dedicated dark mode. When I grab a glass of water later at night, the last thing I need is the entire display blasting my kitchen like a pair of hi-beams.

We gave these AirPods a score of 90 out of 100 in our review and we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users. The third generation model is a substantial update to an already impressive product, bringing new features like live translation to the table. The AirPods Pro 3 also offer heart-rate tracking, allowing them to stream live data to Apple Fitness and other third-party workout apps. This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch. Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial. The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch. Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods' noise cancellation tech, Apple's AI and beam-forming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time. It's not often you see one of Apple's best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you're in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal.

          "standfirst": "Having the right GPS watch on your wrist whether you’re going for your first ever run or your umpteenth run can make all the difference. The best GPS running watches not only keep track of how far you’ve run, but they track pace and other real-time metrics, advanced training features to help you hit your goals and, of course, precise distance measurements. Some models even provide offline maps for navigation, sleep tracking, recovery insights, and smart features that “regular” smartwatches do.For those who need extra durability and lasting battery life, higher-end sport watches — like some of the best Garmin watches — are built to handle intense workouts, harsh weather and long runs. If you're training for a marathon, triathlon or just want a multisport option that can keep up with your lifestyle, these watches have the tech to support you.With so many options available, from entry-level models to the best running watches packed with advanced running metrics, it can be tricky to find the right fit. That’s why we’ve rounded up our top picks to help you choose the perfect GPS watch for your training needs. Best GPS running watches for 2026 Other GPS running watches we tested Polar Pacer Pro The Polar Pacer Pro looked and felt quite similar to our top pick, and it mapped my outdoor runs accurately. However, Polar’s companion app is leagues behind Garmin’s with a confusing interface and a design that feels very much stuck in the past. It’s also $100 more expensive than our top pick. Amazfit Cheetah Pro The Amazfit Cheetah Pro tracked my outdoor runs accurately and Zepp’s companion app has a coaching feature much like Garmin’s adaptive training plans that can outline a routine for you to complete in preparation for a race or to achieve a specific goal. My biggest issue with it was that its touchscreen wasn’t very responsive — it took multiple hard taps on the display to wake it, and often the raise-to-wake feature didn’t work, leaving me staring at a dark screen. What to consider before buying a GPS running watch GPS speed and accuracy The most important thing for a GPS running watch to have is fast, accurate GPS tracking. That might seem obvious, but it’s quite easy to get distracted by all of the other smart features most of these devices have. Since most of them can be worn all day long as standard sport watches, there’s a lot of (possibly unnecessary) fluff that looks good on paper but won’t mean much if the core purpose if the device is left unfulfilled. To that end, I paid particular attention to how long it took each device’s built-in GPS tracking to grab my location before a run, if it ever lost my spot and the accuracy of the generated maps. Also, the device should be smart enough to let you start tracking a run while the GPS looks for your location. Workout profiles and trackable metrics You may not be able to suss out GPS accuracy just by looking at a spec sheet (that’s where this guide can help), but you can check for features like supported workout profiles. That’s something you’ll want to look into, even if your one and only activity is running. Check to make sure the best running watches you’re considering support all the kinds of running activities you like to do (outdoor runs, treadmill runs, etc) and any other workouts you may want to track with it. Most fitness wearables today aren’t one-trick ponies; you’ll find a healthy number of trackable exercise modes on any sport watch worth its salt. That said, the number of workout profiles can be directly proportional to a device’s price: the higher-end the product, chances are the more specific, precise workouts it can monitor. In a similar vein, you’ll want to check the trackable metrics of any watch you’re considering before you buy. Since we’re talking about the best GPS running watches, most will be able to track the basics like distance, heart rate and pace, and those are bare minimums. Some watches can monitor additional stats like speed, cadence, stride length, advanced running dynamics, aerobic and anaerobic training effect, intensity minutes and more. If you’re already a serious runner who trains for multiple races each year, or if you're a trail runner who needs elevation and navigation features, you’ll want to dig into the spec sheet of the watch you’re considering to make sure it can track all of your most necessary metrics. Size and weight It’s worth checking out a watch’s case size and weight before going all-in on one. GPS running watches, and standard smartwatches as well, can have a few different sizes to choose from so you’ll want to make sure you’re getting the best fit for your wrist. I have a smaller wrist, so I tend to avoid extra-large cases (anything over 42mm or so), especially if I intend on wearing the device all day long as my main timepiece. Weight, on the other hand, is a little less controllable, but typically smaller case sizes will save you a few grams in overall weight. For those who need durability, particularly trail runners or those tackling extreme conditions, devices like Garmin watches offer rugged builds that can handle rough terrain, impact, and extreme weather. Battery life Unlike regular smartwatches, GPS running watches have two types of battery life you’ll need to consider: with GPS turned on and in “smartwatch” mode. The former is more important than the latter because most GPS running watches have stellar battery life when used just as a smart timepiece. You can expect to get multiple days on a single charge, with some surviving more than two weeks (with all day and night wear) before they need a recharge. Battery life with GPS turned on will be much shorter by comparison, but any GPS running watch worth its salt should give you at least 10-15 hours of life with the GPS being used continuously. The more you’re willing to spend, the higher that number typically gets, with some GPS running watches lasting for 40 hours while tracking your location.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-gps-running-watch-141513957.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Everything in voice AI just changed: how enterprise AI builders can benefit",
          "standfirst": "Despite lots of hype, \"voice AI\" has so far largely been a euphemism for a request-response loop. You speak, a cloud server transcribes your words, a language model thinks, and a robotic voice reads the text back. Functional, but not really conversational. That all changed in the past week with a rapid succession of powerful, fast, and more capable voice AI model releases from Nvidia, Inworld, FlashLabs, and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen team, combined with a massive talent acquisition and tech licensing deal by Google DeepMind and Hume AI.Now, the industry has effectively solved the four \"impossible\" problems of voice computing: latency, fluidity, efficiency, and emotion.For enterprise builders, the implications are immediate. We have moved from the era of \"chatbots that speak\" to the era of \"empathetic interfaces.\" Here is how the landscape has shifted, the specific licensing models for each new tool, and what it means for the next generation of applications.1. The death of latency – no more awkward pausesThe \"magic number\" in human conversation is roughly 200 milliseconds. That is the typical gap between one person finishing a sentence and another beginning theirs. Anything longer than 500ms feels like a satellite delay; anything over a second breaks the illusion of intelligence entirely.Until now, chaining together ASR (speech recognition), LLMs (intelligence), and TTS (text-to-speech) resulted in latencies of 2–5 seconds.Inworld AI’s release of TTS 1.5 directly attacks this bottleneck. By achieving a P90 latency of under 120ms, Inworld has effectively pushed the technology faster than human perception. For developers building customer service agents or interactive training avatars, this means the \"thinking pause\" is dead. Crucially, Inworld claims this model achieves \"viseme-level synchronization,\" meaning the lip movements of a digital avatar will match the audio frame-by-frame—a requirement for high-fidelity gaming and VR training.It&#x27;s vailable via commercial API (pricing tiers based on usage) with a free tier for testing.Simultaneously, FlashLabs released Chroma 1.0, an end-to-end model that integrates the listening and speaking phases. By processing audio tokens directly via an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2 ratio), the model bypasses the need to convert speech to text and back again. This \"streaming architecture\" allows the model to generate acoustic codes while it is still generating text, effectively \"thinking out loud\" in data form before the audio is even synthesized. This one is open source on Hugging Face under the enterprise-friendly, commercially viable Apache 2.0 license. Together, they signal that speed is no longer a differentiator; it is a commodity. If your voice application has a 3-second delay, it is now obsolete. The standard for 2026 is immediate, interruptible response.2. Solving \"the robot problem\" via full duplexSpeed is useless if the AI is rude. Traditional voice bots are \"half-duplex\"—like a walkie-talkie, they cannot listen while they are speaking. If you try to interrupt a banking bot to correct a mistake, it keeps talking over you.Nvidia&#x27;s PersonaPlex, released last week, introduces a 7-billion parameter \"full-duplex\" model. Built on the Moshi architecture (originally from Kyutai), it uses a dual-stream design: one stream for listening (via the Mimi neural audio codec) and one for speaking (via the Helium language model). This allows the model to update its internal state while the user is speaking, enabling it to handle interruptions gracefully.Crucially, it understands \"backchanneling\"—the non-verbal \"uh-huhs,\" \"rights,\" and \"okays\" that humans use to signal active listening without taking the floor. This is a subtle but profound shift for UI design. An AI that can be interrupted allows for efficiency. A customer can cut off a long legal disclaimer by saying, \"I got it, move on,\" and the AI will instantly pivot. This mimics the dynamics of a high-competence human operator.The model weights are released under the Nvidia Open Model License (permissive for commercial use but with attribution/distribution terms), while the code is MIT Licensed.3. High-fidelity compression leads to smaller data footprintsWhile Inworld and Nvidia focused on speed and behavior, open source AI powerhouse Qwen (parent company Alibaba Cloud) quietly solved the bandwidth problem.Earlier today, the team released Qwen3-TTS, featuring a breakthrough 12Hz tokenizer. In plain English, this means the model can represent high-fidelity speech using an incredibly small amount of data—just 12 tokens per second.For comparison, previous state-of-the-art models required significantly higher token rates to maintain audio quality. Qwen’s benchmarks show it outperforming competitors like FireredTTS 2 on key reconstruction metrics (MCD, CER, WER) while using fewer tokens.Why does this matter for the enterprise? Cost and scale. A model that requires less data to generate speech is cheaper to run and faster to stream, especially on edge devices or in low-bandwidth environments (like a field technician using a voice assistant on a 4G connection). It turns high-quality voice AI from a server-hogging luxury into a lightweight utility.It&#x27;s available on Hugging Face now under a permissive Apache 2.0 license, perfect for research and commercial application.4. The missing &#x27;it&#x27; factor: emotional intelligencePerhaps the most significant news of the week—and the most complex—is Google DeepMind’s move to license Hume AI’s technology and hire its CEO, Alan Cowen, along with key research staff.While Google integrates this tech into Gemini to power the next generation of consumer assistants, Hume AI itself is pivoting to become the infrastructure backbone for the enterprise. Under new CEO Andrew Ettinger, Hume is doubling down on the thesis that \"emotion\" is not a UI feature, but a data problem.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat regarding the transition, Ettinger explained that as voice becomes the primary interface, the current stack is insufficient because it treats all inputs as flat text.\"I saw firsthand how the frontier labs are using data to drive model accuracy,\" Ettinger says. \"Voice is very clearly emerging as the de facto interface for AI. If you see that happening, you would also conclude that emotional intelligence around that voice is going to be critical—dialects, understanding, reasoning, modulation.\"The challenge for enterprise builders has been that LLMs are sociopaths by design—they predict the next word, not the emotional state of the user. A healthcare bot that sounds cheerful when a patient reports chronic pain is a liability. A financial bot that sounds bored when a client reports fraud is a churn risk.Ettinger emphasizes that this isn&#x27;t just about making bots sound nice; it&#x27;s about competitive advantage. When asked about the increasingly competitive landscape and the role of open source versus proprietary models, Ettinger remained pragmatic. He noted that while open-source models like PersonaPlex are raising the baseline for interaction, the proprietary advantage lies in the data—specifically, the high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data that Hume has spent years collecting.\"The team at Hume ran headfirst into a problem shared by nearly every team building voice models today: the lack of high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data for post-training,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. \"Solving this required rethinking how audio data is sourced, labeled, and evaluated...

          "content": "Despite lots of hype, \"voice AI\" has so far largely been a euphemism for a request-response loop. You speak, a cloud server transcribes your words, a language model thinks, and a robotic voice reads the text back. Functional, but not really conversational. That all changed in the past week with a rapid succession of powerful, fast, and more capable voice AI model releases from Nvidia, Inworld, FlashLabs, and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen team, combined with a massive talent acquisition and tech licensing deal by Google DeepMind and Hume AI.Now, the industry has effectively solved the four \"impossible\" problems of voice computing: latency, fluidity, efficiency, and emotion.For enterprise builders, the implications are immediate. We have moved from the era of \"chatbots that speak\" to the era of \"empathetic interfaces.\" Here is how the landscape has shifted, the specific licensing models for each new tool, and what it means for the next generation of applications.1. The death of latency – no more awkward pausesThe \"magic number\" in human conversation is roughly 200 milliseconds. That is the typical gap between one person finishing a sentence and another beginning theirs. Anything longer than 500ms feels like a satellite delay; anything over a second breaks the illusion of intelligence entirely.Until now, chaining together ASR (speech recognition), LLMs (intelligence), and TTS (text-to-speech) resulted in latencies of 2–5 seconds.Inworld AI’s release of TTS 1.5 directly attacks this bottleneck. By achieving a P90 latency of under 120ms, Inworld has effectively pushed the technology faster than human perception. For developers building customer service agents or interactive training avatars, this means the \"thinking pause\" is dead. Crucially, Inworld claims this model achieves \"viseme-level synchronization,\" meaning the lip movements of a digital avatar will match the audio frame-by-frame—a requirement for high-fidelity gaming and VR training.It&#x27;s vailable via commercial API (pricing tiers based on usage) with a free tier for testing.Simultaneously, FlashLabs released Chroma 1.0, an end-to-end model that integrates the listening and speaking phases. By processing audio tokens directly via an interleaved text-audio token schedule (1:2 ratio), the model bypasses the need to convert speech to text and back again. This \"streaming architecture\" allows the model to generate acoustic codes while it is still generating text, effectively \"thinking out loud\" in data form before the audio is even synthesized. This one is open source on Hugging Face under the enterprise-friendly, commercially viable Apache 2.0 license. Together, they signal that speed is no longer a differentiator; it is a commodity. If your voice application has a 3-second delay, it is now obsolete. The standard for 2026 is immediate, interruptible response.2. Solving \"the robot problem\" via full duplexSpeed is useless if the AI is rude. Traditional voice bots are \"half-duplex\"—like a walkie-talkie, they cannot listen while they are speaking. If you try to interrupt a banking bot to correct a mistake, it keeps talking over you.Nvidia&#x27;s PersonaPlex, released last week, introduces a 7-billion parameter \"full-duplex\" model. Built on the Moshi architecture (originally from Kyutai), it uses a dual-stream design: one stream for listening (via the Mimi neural audio codec) and one for speaking (via the Helium language model). This allows the model to update its internal state while the user is speaking, enabling it to handle interruptions gracefully.Crucially, it understands \"backchanneling\"—the non-verbal \"uh-huhs,\" \"rights,\" and \"okays\" that humans use to signal active listening without taking the floor. This is a subtle but profound shift for UI design. An AI that can be interrupted allows for efficiency. A customer can cut off a long legal disclaimer by saying, \"I got it, move on,\" and the AI will instantly pivot. This mimics the dynamics of a high-competence human operator.The model weights are released under the Nvidia Open Model License (permissive for commercial use but with attribution/distribution terms), while the code is MIT Licensed.3. High-fidelity compression leads to smaller data footprintsWhile Inworld and Nvidia focused on speed and behavior, open source AI powerhouse Qwen (parent company Alibaba Cloud) quietly solved the bandwidth problem.Earlier today, the team released Qwen3-TTS, featuring a breakthrough 12Hz tokenizer. In plain English, this means the model can represent high-fidelity speech using an incredibly small amount of data—just 12 tokens per second.For comparison, previous state-of-the-art models required significantly higher token rates to maintain audio quality. Qwen’s benchmarks show it outperforming competitors like FireredTTS 2 on key reconstruction metrics (MCD, CER, WER) while using fewer tokens.Why does this matter for the enterprise? Cost and scale. A model that requires less data to generate speech is cheaper to run and faster to stream, especially on edge devices or in low-bandwidth environments (like a field technician using a voice assistant on a 4G connection). It turns high-quality voice AI from a server-hogging luxury into a lightweight utility.It&#x27;s available on Hugging Face now under a permissive Apache 2.0 license, perfect for research and commercial application.4. The missing &#x27;it&#x27; factor: emotional intelligencePerhaps the most significant news of the week—and the most complex—is Google DeepMind’s move to license Hume AI’s technology and hire its CEO, Alan Cowen, along with key research staff.While Google integrates this tech into Gemini to power the next generation of consumer assistants, Hume AI itself is pivoting to become the infrastructure backbone for the enterprise. Under new CEO Andrew Ettinger, Hume is doubling down on the thesis that \"emotion\" is not a UI feature, but a data problem.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat regarding the transition, Ettinger explained that as voice becomes the primary interface, the current stack is insufficient because it treats all inputs as flat text.\"I saw firsthand how the frontier labs are using data to drive model accuracy,\" Ettinger says. \"Voice is very clearly emerging as the de facto interface for AI. If you see that happening, you would also conclude that emotional intelligence around that voice is going to be critical—dialects, understanding, reasoning, modulation.\"The challenge for enterprise builders has been that LLMs are sociopaths by design—they predict the next word, not the emotional state of the user. A healthcare bot that sounds cheerful when a patient reports chronic pain is a liability. A financial bot that sounds bored when a client reports fraud is a churn risk.Ettinger emphasizes that this isn&#x27;t just about making bots sound nice; it&#x27;s about competitive advantage. When asked about the increasingly competitive landscape and the role of open source versus proprietary models, Ettinger remained pragmatic. He noted that while open-source models like PersonaPlex are raising the baseline for interaction, the proprietary advantage lies in the data—specifically, the high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data that Hume has spent years collecting.\"The team at Hume ran headfirst into a problem shared by nearly every team building voice models today: the lack of high-quality, emotionally annotated speech data for post-training,\" he wrote on LinkedIn. \"Solving this required rethinking how audio data is sourced, labeled, and evaluated...

          "standfirst": "After half a decade of waiting, Microsoft finally offered an extended preview of its long-awaited reboot of the beloved Fable RPG franchise on Thursday. During the company’s recent Developer Direct showcase, Playground Games, best known for its works on the Forza Horizon series, shared nearly 11 minutes of gameplay footage and commentary related to the upcoming title. The new game will feature a fully open world for players to explore, with locations from previous Fable games like Bowerstone making a return. Playground didn’t say exactly where the new game takes place in the Fable timeline. If you played 2010’s Fable 3, you may recall there was a time gap between each of the original games, with the final Lionhead entry giving players the chance to explore a version of Albion that’s been thrown into the tumult of an industrial revolution. This new game appears to offer a more traditional Medieval fantasy setting. From what little Playground shared of the story, the player character is the first hero born in Albion in a generation. Like previous Fable games, their story will begin when they’re a child. They’ll leave their home of Briar Hill after a “mysterious stranger” turns all the inhabitants into stone. Before you set off on your adventure, you’ll be able to decide what your hero looks like, with customization including options for different skin tones, head shapes, tattoos and scars. All pretty standard stuff, and combat doesn’t look groundbreaking. Your character can use a combination of melee and ranged weapons, alongside magic, to defeat their foes. In addition to a health bar, enemies appear to have a posture meter players can break through both light and heavy attacks, before carrying out “stylish” finishers. Judging from the footage Playground shared, combat doesn’t quite have the kinetic feel of say a FromSoftware title. Thankfully, there’s more to the game than just fighting monsters. Like past Fable games, players can ask villagers out on dates, before eventually marrying them and having children, and you’re not limited to a monogamous relationship. It looks like Playground built a modern polycule simulator. Beyond that, you can also purchase every house and business in Albion. The game’s NPCs will develop an opinion of your hero and their actions. Say you evict an artist that lived in one of the houses you bought, you can later meet them on the street and they’ll tell you to your face that you’re awful. Wonderful stuff. From a technical perspective, the footage Playground showed off looked on the rough side. The game’s frame rate and frame pacing wasn’t smooth, and I’m pretty sure I saw ghosting in some of the animations. Hopefully the studio has enough time between now and when the game is finally released sometime this autumn to polish the presentation. When the game does arrive, it will be available on Xbox Series X/S, PC via Xbox and Steam, PlayStation 5 and Game Pass Ultimate. Microsoft first announced a new Fable game was in development back in 2020. It then went three years before sharing a preview of the title, which was originally slated to arrive in 2025 before it was delayed to this year last February.

That lines up with earlier reports about the release date(s) after an in-game ad supposedly appeared in Forza Horizon 5. The upcoming title will hit PS5 later this year.The standard edition of Forza Horizon 6 is expected to cost $70, though it will be on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

In a few feature called Horizon Rush, you’ll take on obstacle courses. Playground says this is the largest Forza Horizon game to date. This version of Tokyo, for instance, is said to be five times larger than any urban area the studio has built before and it has multiple districts.

          "title": "An AI pin is beneath Apple",
          "standfirst": "So it's come to this: Apple is reportedly working on a wearable AI pin. According to The Information, it is going to be a small device with \"multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones and wireless charging.\" It sounds like the perfect gadget to pair with the long-awaited AI-powered Siri update, which will also reportedly work as a chatbot. But while many Apple rumors conjure up an air of excitement, the notion of an Apple AI pin sounds downright baffling. Worse, it just seems desperate. Apple, the company known for taking its time to jump into new categories with more thoughtful solutions than its competitors, is reportedly chasing the specter of OpenAI's unreleased AI pin. Never mind that OpenAI has never actually produced any hardware, and that it arguably stumbled into its position as a leading AI player. And never mind that Humane's AI pin was a notorious failure that barely worked, and seemed pointless from the start. Sure, Apple doesn't want more AI eggs on its face, after the delay of its Siri revamp and the underwhelming (and error-prone) debut of Apple Intelligence. Beyond OpenAI, there's also competition from Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which lean heavily on the company’s AI. There’s also the looming threat of whatever AI hardware Meta is cooking up next, following the layoffs from its virtual reality division. And while Google doesn’t have much to show from its Android XR platform, which aims to bring its Gemini AI to your face, Samsung’s Galaxy XR is a start. We’ve also recently seen compelling demos of Google’s AR glasses prototypes and Xreal’s Project Aura glasses.If Apple's AI pin serves as a conduit to Siri, is it really that much more convenient than using an iPhone, AirPods or even an Apple Watch to do the same? The company has reportedly nixed plans to put cameras in the Apple Watch, and Bloomberg suggests it’s opting instead to focus on delivering its own smart glasses this year. But it’s not hard to imagine that faster hardware could let the Apple Watch handle more Siri and AI-related tasks on its own. It’s already a fairly self-sufficient device, allowing you to ask basic Siri queries, run apps and listen to music without an iPhone — the cellular models are even more capable since they can take calls and send messages.Rumors also point to infrared cameras coming to the next AirPods and AirPod Pros. Instead of taking photos, they could enable hand gestures and environmental awareness, which might be useful for Apple Intelligence down the line. The addition of heart rate tracking in the AirPods Pro 3 shows that there are still new features Apple can bring to its buds, beyond listening to music.At best, an Apple AI pin could just be a simple way for someone to access Siri if they don’t want to wear an Apple Watch, plug in AirPods or have their iPhone within shouting distance. But at least those devices do other things beyond talking to Siri. The same is true for Meta’s Ray-Bans and future smart glasses. Even without accessing AI, they’ll still let you listen to music, take calls and, well, be glasses for those who need prescription frames.Given the vocal pushback against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which are also being banned on cruises, clubs and other venues, I'm also not convinced many people would be eager to prominently display a surveillance device throughout the day. Wired’s Julian Chokkattu was questioned about wearing a camera while he was testing the Humane AI Pin, and I’ve also had to explain to curious people why I was wearing Xreal’s smart glasses, which feature a prominent camera accessory.Sure, we're already living in a panopticon of smartphone cameras, but it's also obvious when someone is using their phone to capture photos and video. An AI pin just dangling off of your clothes is a constant threat, an unblinking eye. Even if Apple implements some sort of capture notification, someone will always try to circumvent it.While The Information notes Apple's AI pin may never actually see the light of day, I wouldn't be surprised if it does. This is the company that partnered with OpenAI just to make Siri appear slightly smarter with the debut of Apple Intelligence. And instead of building its own home-brewed AI models, it's banking on Google's Gemini to power Siri's big AI upgrade, as well as its future foundation models. When it comes to AI, Apple will do almost anything to avoid being seen as a straggler (and to avoid even more stock declines). It’s genuinely strange that Apple, the company that let Samsung and Google get a multi-year head start on foldable smartphones and hasn't yet jumped into the world of smart rings, could fast-track an AI pin for 2027. It’s yet another example of how the AI hype cycle has warped priorities throughout the tech industry. But at least Apple’s fortunes don’t depend on standalone AI hardware as much as OpenAI.

          "content": "So it's come to this: Apple is reportedly working on a wearable AI pin. According to The Information, it is going to be a small device with \"multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones and wireless charging.\" It sounds like the perfect gadget to pair with the long-awaited AI-powered Siri update, which will also reportedly work as a chatbot. But while many Apple rumors conjure up an air of excitement, the notion of an Apple AI pin sounds downright baffling. Worse, it just seems desperate. Apple, the company known for taking its time to jump into new categories with more thoughtful solutions than its competitors, is reportedly chasing the specter of OpenAI's unreleased AI pin. Never mind that OpenAI has never actually produced any hardware, and that it arguably stumbled into its position as a leading AI player. And never mind that Humane's AI pin was a notorious failure that barely worked, and seemed pointless from the start. Sure, Apple doesn't want more AI eggs on its face, after the delay of its Siri revamp and the underwhelming (and error-prone) debut of Apple Intelligence. Beyond OpenAI, there's also competition from Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which lean heavily on the company’s AI. There’s also the looming threat of whatever AI hardware Meta is cooking up next, following the layoffs from its virtual reality division. And while Google doesn’t have much to show from its Android XR platform, which aims to bring its Gemini AI to your face, Samsung’s Galaxy XR is a start. We’ve also recently seen compelling demos of Google’s AR glasses prototypes and Xreal’s Project Aura glasses.If Apple's AI pin serves as a conduit to Siri, is it really that much more convenient than using an iPhone, AirPods or even an Apple Watch to do the same? The company has reportedly nixed plans to put cameras in the Apple Watch, and Bloomberg suggests it’s opting instead to focus on delivering its own smart glasses this year. But it’s not hard to imagine that faster hardware could let the Apple Watch handle more Siri and AI-related tasks on its own. It’s already a fairly self-sufficient device, allowing you to ask basic Siri queries, run apps and listen to music without an iPhone — the cellular models are even more capable since they can take calls and send messages.Rumors also point to infrared cameras coming to the next AirPods and AirPod Pros. Instead of taking photos, they could enable hand gestures and environmental awareness, which might be useful for Apple Intelligence down the line. The addition of heart rate tracking in the AirPods Pro 3 shows that there are still new features Apple can bring to its buds, beyond listening to music.At best, an Apple AI pin could just be a simple way for someone to access Siri if they don’t want to wear an Apple Watch, plug in AirPods or have their iPhone within shouting distance. But at least those devices do other things beyond talking to Siri. The same is true for Meta’s Ray-Bans and future smart glasses. Even without accessing AI, they’ll still let you listen to music, take calls and, well, be glasses for those who need prescription frames.Given the vocal pushback against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which are also being banned on cruises, clubs and other venues, I'm also not convinced many people would be eager to prominently display a surveillance device throughout the day. Wired’s Julian Chokkattu was questioned about wearing a camera while he was testing the Humane AI Pin, and I’ve also had to explain to curious people why I was wearing Xreal’s smart glasses, which feature a prominent camera accessory.Sure, we're already living in a panopticon of smartphone cameras, but it's also obvious when someone is using their phone to capture photos and video. An AI pin just dangling off of your clothes is a constant threat, an unblinking eye. Even if Apple implements some sort of capture notification, someone will always try to circumvent it.While The Information notes Apple's AI pin may never actually see the light of day, I wouldn't be surprised if it does. This is the company that partnered with OpenAI just to make Siri appear slightly smarter with the debut of Apple Intelligence. And instead of building its own home-brewed AI models, it's banking on Google's Gemini to power Siri's big AI upgrade, as well as its future foundation models. When it comes to AI, Apple will do almost anything to avoid being seen as a straggler (and to avoid even more stock declines).

          "standfirst": "In a chaotic world, one thing you can count on is your own common-sense steps toward better cybersecurity. Most of the holiday deals are over by now, but plenty of services are still offering excellent prices. With access to a virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart online trackers. We strongly recommend using a VPN, but you might get stuck with a substandard app if you jump on the very first deal you see. You might also mistakenly end up paying more than you want to, as even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $78.18 for a two-year subscription with four months free (78 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 78 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $100.58 for a two-year subscription with four months free (74 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan. NordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has also taken 70 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "Canon EOS R6 III review: A video powerhouse that's also great for photography",
          "standfirst": "With video features like RAW now the norm on midrange mirrorless cameras, Canon decided not to mess around with its latest model, the 33-megapixel EOS R6 III. It’s a veritable cinematic beast, allowing up to 7K RAW video capture internally with fast and reliable autofocus and rock solid stabilization. At the same time, it's a solid photo camera with high burst speeds and warm, accurate image quality. The R6 III has stiff competition with Sony’s 33MP A7 V, though, as the latter delivers higher dynamic range. The price could also be an issue for buyers, as the R6 III costs $300 more than its predecessor. Whether it’s worth that extra money depends on what you’re planning to do with it. Handling and design Canon EOS R6 III Steve Dent for Engadget The EOS R6 III is quintessentially Canon in terms of design. It strongly resembles the R6 II and EOS R5 II, with the same button and dial layout at the rear. In terms of functionality, this is a good thing as everything falls perfectly to hand, letting you control it by feel once you’re used to it. However, the R6 III’s design is a bit bland, so if you’re looking for a stylish camera a la Fujifilm, this is not the one. Holding the R6 III is also a pleasure thanks to the grippy, soft rubber exterior, though at 1.5 pounds it’s a bit heavier than the A7 V. It’s comfortable to hold and use all day, unlike Sony’s A7 V which felt uncomfortable after prolonged usage because of the harder material and sharp crease around the fingertip area. The R6 III’s 3.69-million dot, 120 fps electronic viewfinder (EVF) worked fine for me to check color and focus, but falls short of the one on the much cheaper Nikon Z6 III. The flip-out 3-inch 1.65-million-dot rear touch display is on par for this category and does the job well. For storage, the R6 III supports CFexpress Type B cards for capturing RAW video, along with SD UHS II for MP4 video and photos. Other key features include headphone and microphone ports, a full-sized HDMI input (instead of microHDMI as before, thankfully) and a USB-C port for charging and transfers. Battery life is decent for this category with a maximum 510 shots per charge or 620 shots if you engage the power saving mode or about 90 minutes of continuous 4K capture. However, you can roughly double those figures with Canon's optional $150 BG-R20 battery grip. Performance Canon's EOS R6 III offers fast burst speeds and skin-tone friendly colors Steve Dent for Engadget The R6 III offers a boost in shooting speeds over its predecessor thanks to an all-new 33MP sensor. It has a faster readout speed than the R6 II as well, allowing for faster bursts and lower rolling shutter skew. In comparison, Sony’s A7 V also has a 33MP sensor but it’s partially stacked, so it delivers less distortion when shooting fast-moving subjects. With that new sensor and a 34 percent faster Digic X processor, the R6 III can shoot bursts at up to 40 fps in electronic and 12 fps in mechanical shutter modes (with continuous AF and AE enabled). That’s second only to the Panasonic S1 II (70 fps) in this price range. You can fill the buffer in about 3.7 seconds at that speed (150 RAW frames), which is a decent amount for a midrange camera. You usually want to avoid the electronic shutter with fast-moving action due to rolling shutter distortion, but the R6 III’s faster sensor can handle objects that are moving reasonably quickly. I also caught a few photos of babies, bikes and dogs I might have otherwise missed by using the new pre-capture mode that records up to 15 photos before fully declencing the shutter. The new sensor and processor also make the R6 III’s autofocus system faster and more accurate than before. When shooting bursts for fast moving action like dogs running or biking, less than five percent of my shots were out of focus. And the EOS R6 III can now track animals, birds and vehicles, on top of the faces, eyes and bodies of people. This camera also has a couple of new autofocus tricks, including one called Register People Priority. That lets you save up to 10 individuals on camera that it can identify and automatically switch to. I found it handy in a large gathering, helping me focus on my niece enjoying her second Christmas. However, the R6 III lacks a few autofocus features found on the R5 II like “action priority” for sports, eye control AF and AI upscaling. In-body stabilization is also excellent, keeping the sensor rock-steady for handheld shooting with 8.5 stops of shake reduction. With that enabled, I was able to nicely blur action on the streets while keeping the background sharply in focus at shutter speeds down to a full second. Image quality With a 33MP sensor instead of a 24MP sensor, the R6 III offers quite a bit more sharpness and a touch more dynamic range than its predecessor. When shooting RAW, I was able to coax a lot of detail out of high contrast shots on sunny days with dark shadows. However, Sony’s A7 V soundly beats the R6 III in terms of dynamic range, thanks to its innovative new sensor. The R6 III’s high ISO performance isn’t too bad for a higher-resolution camera either, with noise staying under control up to ISO 12,800. As is typical with Canon models, skin tones are warmer and more flattering than on Sony and Nikon cameras, due to the slightly more yellow-biased pink tones. Those pleasing colors were consistent, even at high ISOs, when I shot kids and adults at a couple of indoor gatherings. If you don’t want the hassle of RAW, JPEG rendering is excellent straight out of the camera, with well balanced sharpening and noise reduction. Note that switching to electronic shutter mode drops the sensor to a 12-bit readout, which helps burst speeds but hurts image quality. This is a pretty big downside compared to the A7 V, which maintains 14-bit quality even when shooting at the camera’s maximum rate at 30 fps. So while on paper the R6 III wins the speed race, the 10 extra fps won’t be worth the drop in quality for many photographers. Video Canon’s EOS R6 III Steve Dent for Engadget Canon has improved video on the R6 III in every way, putting it nearly on par with the more expensive R5 II. Though it can’t shoot 8K, it can handle 7K RAW video at up to 60 fps (on CFexpress only) and 4K at 120p, with less rolling shutter than the R6 II. It also supports 3:2 “open gate” video that uses the full sensor area so you can output high-res vertical video and other formats. The R6 III supports 4K 10-bit MP4 shooting at high data rates too if you’d rather save storage space or shoot on SD cards. You also get CLog 2 on top of CLog 3 capability for improved dynamic range. Oddly though, Canon made it a bit of a pain to switch to log modes compared to past models, forcing you to slog through a bunch of menus to do so. Video autofocus is excellent across all resolutions, with rapid subject acquisition and reliable tracking. Face and eye detection work very well, and I only occasionally noticed slight autofocus lag with fast-moving subjects, particularly when they were moving toward the camera. As for stabilization, I could smoothly shoot handheld with no crop, provided I didn’t move the camera too aggressively. Digital stabilization allowed even more movement and the enhanced setting let me shoot smoothly while walking (7K doesn’t work in the digital stabilization modes, though). Panasonic’s S5 II is still the best in this regard with slightly smoother stabilization, but the R6 III isn’t far behind. Video on the EOS R6 III is extremely sharp in RAW and the HQ modes, particularly with supersampled 4K HQ. Other 4K modes are subsampled, but nearly as sharp. Rolling shutter is better managed than before, but you’ll still want to avoid things like whip pans, sudden jolts or rapid subjects like propellers or golf swings. In a variety of shooting scenarios in bright and dark conditions, Canon’s excellent color science delivered warm skin tones and accurate colors. Shooting RAW video allowed me to widely adjust shots in post, while the CLog 2 mode drastically improved dynamic range while I was shooting in contrasty conditions. For instance, I shot the famous Paris department store windows and was able to extract detail from the very bright and dark parts of the video. Overheating has been an issue in the past on Canon’s R6 models, but the R6 III never shut down for me, even during a few tests of over 15 minutes. Overall, it reliably delivered outstanding video quality and I actually preferred it to the R5 II due to the smaller RAW file sizes. Wrap-up Canon EOS R6 III mirrorless camera Steve Dent for Engadget Canon’s EOS R6 III is now the best midrange camera for creators thanks to the RAW video, rapid and accurate autofocus and excellent handling. At the same time, it’s a solid camera for photography with high burst speeds, extra resolution and, again, reliable AF. If it’s mainly photography you’re interested in, though, Sony’s $2,900 A7 V is a better choice. It matches the R6 III’s resolution, price and autofocus but offers superior dynamic range and lower rolling shutter distortion. Other video-centric options may be more attractive for other reasons — including budget. Nikon’s 24MP Z6 III offers similar capabilities, has a partially stacked sensor and retails for $2,400, but can often be found on sale for less. Panasonic’s S1 II is also a good pick due to its RAW video and creator-centric features, though it costs more at $3,200. Which one to buy, then, depends on your budget, usage (video or photography) and whether you already have lenses in one system or another. With that said, if it’s a Canon camera you’re after and you lean toward content creation, the EOS R6 III is your best choice.

Wonder for the console. Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (to give the new edition's full name) will arrive on March 26. Those who own the original Switch version of the game will be able to buy an upgrade pack, which costs $20. There's a lot of new stuff in the Switch 2 version, including co-op and multiplayer features. Bellabel Park, a fresh area of the Flower Kingdom, will open up. You can jump into some multiplayer modes here, such as one where you compete to collect as many coins as possible. A section that's all about local multiplayer has 17 co-op and versus modes. You can either play those on the same console or use GameShare so that up to three other people in the same physical place as you can join in on their own Switch or Switch 2. The Game Room Plaza, meanwhile, supports local and online play for six minigames — each player will need their own system for those. Up to eight people can play using the local wireless feature, and up to 12 via online multiplayer.Along with those multiplayer minigame areas, Bellabel Park is home to Toad Brigade Training Camp. Here, you can take on challenges based on levels from the main game. You can tackle these on your own or recruit up to three friends to help (you'll only need one Switch 2 for this). There are new things to check out in the main game as well. You can take on boss courses that feature all seven Koopalings and (finally!) play as Rosalina.Nintendo is adding an option in which a second player can control a Luma. They can help out the main player by defeating enemies and collecting coins. You can play as the Luma by using the Switch 2 mouse control feature. That's a great idea, as it could allow, say, a parent or guardian who is not too familiar with a game controller to assist a kid who needs some extra help to get through Super Mario Bros. Wonder. In addition, there's an assist mode. When this is enabled, you can quickly recover from falling into a pit (with a propeller flower bringing you back into the action) and avoid taking any damage. That's not all, folks. Also on March 26, you can snag three new amiibo from the game: Elephant Mario (which I'm going to have to buy), Poplin & Prince Florian and Captain Toad & Talking Flower. A couple of weeks earlier, on March 12, Nintendo will start selling a physical version of the Talking Flower from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The battery-powered device will talk to you a couple of times per hour, mentioning things like the room temperature and time. It can play music as well. There's a button you can press to hear it talk (or hold to make it shut up). There's support for 11 languages and it can chatter at set times, making it a bit similar to Nintendo's Alarmo. You'll be able to buy Talking Flower from Nintendo's New York and San Francisco stores, its online store and some other retailers, with pre-orders opening today.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-version-of-super-mario-bros-wonder-arrives-on-march-26-150916983.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure",
          "standfirst": "Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.\"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?\" said Jake Cooper, Railway&#x27;s 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can&#x27;t keep up.\"The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistantsRailway&#x27;s pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.\"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks,\" Cooper told VentureBeat. \"What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents.\"The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.\"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day,\" Lobaton said. \"If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes.\"Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratchWhat distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: \"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\"\"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience,\" Cooper said. \"Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at &#x27;agentic speed&#x27; while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town.\"The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.\"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing,\" Cooper noted. \"But when they&#x27;re charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we&#x27;ve purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity.\"How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenueRailway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. \"We&#x27;re default alive; there&#x27;s no reason for us to raise money,\" he said. \"We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive.\"The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway&#x27;s two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.\"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,\" Cooper recalled. \"And to some degree, they came.\"From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway&#x27;s unlikely corporate expansionDespite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit&#x27;s GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor&#x27;s Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.\"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,\" said Rafael Garcia, Kernel&#x27;s chief technology officer. \"Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.\"For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer&#x27;s existing cloud environment through a \"bring your own cloud\" configuration.Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).The startup&#x27;s bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivalsRailway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.Cooper argues that Railway&#x27;s competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.\"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven&#x27;t gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,\" he observed. \"They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don&#x27;t really need to?\"Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. \"We&#x27;re not just containers; we&#x27;ve got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,\" Cooper said. \"And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.\"The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists todayRailway&#x27;s fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.\"The amount of software that&#x27;s going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we&#x27;re talking a thousand times more software,\" Cooper predicted. \"All of that has to run somewhere.\"The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls \"loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.\" Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.\"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,\" Cooper said. \"You don&#x27;t have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.\"What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experienceRailway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company&#x27;s five-year history.\"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,\" Cooper explained. \"We&#x27;ve built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what&#x27;s been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.\"The company&#x27;s investor roster reads like a who&#x27;s who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.The timing of Railway&#x27;s expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper&#x27;s telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.\"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,\" he said. \"Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That&#x27;s the prize worth playing for, and there&#x27;s no bigger one on offer.\"For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.",

          "standfirst": "Ahead of its upcoming price hike, Spotify is rolling out a more advanced AI playlist feature in the US and Canada. Prompted Playlist, which the company trialed in New Zealand late last year, lets subscribers \"control the Spotify algorithm,\" as the company describes it. \"You're not just asking for music, you're shaping how Spotify goes about discovering it for you.\"For example, you can guide it to make a playlist of songs you've saved to your Library but haven't listened to yet. (It can tap into your entire Spotify history.) Or, you can tell it to round up songs from a specific television show or movie. (It uses real-time information about pop culture, charts, and history.)The feature includes options to refresh the playlist over time (daily or weekly).

To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to Monarch Money, one of Engadget's favorite budgeting apps, for just $50 if you use code NEWYEAR2026 at checkout and you're a new subscriber. That's a 50 percent discount on the service's normal $100 price. Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you're tracking that month. How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you've labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together. The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app's learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch's web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you're trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.

          "standfirst": "The peak time for deals on streaming services — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported Disney+ Hulu bundle for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.

          "title": "How to find an affordable GPU during the great RAMageddon of 2026",
          "standfirst": "If you're thinking about upgrading to a new graphics card this year, your window for doing so at MSRP has closed. When I first reported on this at the start of December, things were looking bleak but you could still find GPUs from both AMD and NVIDIA at close to their recommended prices. That changed last week when YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed reported that ASUS had stopped producing the RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB due to ongoing memory shortages. After Engadget published the news, NVIDIA disputed the report. “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a company spokesperson told us. The next day, ASUS walked back its previous statements. After “explicitly” telling Hardware Unboxed it had placed the 5060 Ti 16GB and 5070 Ti into \"end-of-life status,\" the company said \"certain media may have received incomplete information from an ASUS PR representative regarding these products,\" adding it had \"no plans to stop selling these models.\" Whether or not the 5060 Ti 16GB and 5070 Ti remain in production, one thing is certain: the AI boom has created a great deal of uncertainty in the GPU market. After the news, panic buying sent the price of the 5070 Ti through the roof. Right now, it's impossible to find that model priced at its MSRP of $749. As of the writing of this article, the most affordable version of the 5070 Ti I could find on Newegg was $1,199. The bigger problem is that the 5070 Ti isn't the only GPU selling for far more than MSRP. Tom's Hardware has been tracking GPU prices for months, and there's not a single model you can buy at either AMD or NVIDIA's recommended price. That puts PC builders in a tough spot. What do you do if you want to upgrade to a new graphics card this year? If you're sitting on an older GPU, the best advice I can give is to stick with your current hardware. If you're fine with the performance of your video card right now, it's best to wait a year or two for the market to settle down. On the other hand, if your current GPU is not up to the task of running the games you want to play, try to buy a card with at least 12GB of VRAM — preferably 16GB if your budget allows for it. Unless you plan to play mostly older games on a 1080p monitor, it's not worth considering a model with 8GB of VRAM — it won't last you long enough to warrant the purchase price. For the most part, the recommendations in Engadget's recent GPU guide are still as relevant today as they were a few months ago. The recommendations I provide here are pulled from that guide and are grouped from most affordable to most expensive. Where possible, I've tried to find options from both Newegg and Amazon. As you go about looking for a new GPU, your best friend is a website like PCPartPicker where you can track pricing across multiple retailers. RecommendationsAMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GBThe Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB is the best mainstream option right now. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetUnfortunately if you're on a tight budget, there aren't many great options under $400. For that reason, I would steer you to the Radeon RX 9060 XT as the best \"entry-level\" option. AMD offers two different versions of this GPU: one with 8GB of VRAM and the other with 16GB. Of the two, the latter is the better purchase, but if it's outside your budget, the more affordable model is probably the best 8GB GPU on the market right now.While I couldn't find the 16GB variant at its recommended price of $350, I did find a few models that weren't far off. Newegg has options from ASRock and Sapphire priced at $400 and $450. At Amazon, meanwhile, you can find models from PowerColor for $400 and $430. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 A Founders Edition NVIDIA RTX 5080 sits on a wood desk.Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetI'm somewhat hesitant to recommend the RTX 5070. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent enough card, but with only 12GB of VRAM, you may end up replacing it sooner than you think. That said, it's one of the few NVIDIA GPUs that hasn't shot up massively in price, and I suspect that's because people have been passing it over in favor of other 50-series models. If you value NVIDIA's feature set over raw frames, then the 5070 is about the only GPU that makes sense to buy from the company right now. On Newegg, I found a 5070 model from Gigabyte for $650. The retailer also has a handful of different MSI variants priced at $630. Amazon has fewer options, but it does have one 5070 from Gigabyte for $585, which is the closest to the card's $549 MSRP. AMD Radeon RX 9070 If you're a fan of Team Red, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are among the best cards of this generation. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetFor a card that offers better price-to-performance than the 5070, the Radeon RX 9070 is your best bet. AMD's take on NVIDIA features like DLSS aren't as polished, but the RX 9070 offers more VRAM and excellent performance across the latest AAA games. It's unlikely you'll find one at its MSRP of $550, which was always more of an aspirational price, but I found a few models priced between $590 and $640. Both Newegg and Amazon have a PowerColor model for $590. The two also have a Gigabyte model priced at $600 after $40 rebate with coupon. AMD Radeon RX 9070XTFor those with more to spend, the RX 9070 XT is probably where I would cap things. Beyond that, you're looking at GPUs like the 5080 that cost far more than MSRP. On Newegg, I found a model from ASRock selling for $730. Amazon, meanwhile, has options from Gigabyte and ASUS for $720. None of those are great deals, but that's to be expected with a card that's at the top of the stack.

MemRL allows agents to use environmental feedback to refine their problem-solving strategies continuously.MemRL is part of a broader push in the research community to develop continual learning capabilities for AI applications. In experiments on key industry benchmarks, the framework outperformed other baselines such as RAG and other memory organization techniques, particularly in complex environments that require exploration and experiments. This suggests MemRL could become a critical component for building AI applications that must operate in dynamic real-world settings where requirements and tasks constantly shift.The stability-plasticity dilemmaOne of the central challenges in deploying agentic applications is adapting the underlying model to new knowledge and tasks after the initial training phase. Current approaches generally fall into two categories: parametric approaches, such as fine-tuning, and non-parametric approaches, such as RAG. But both come with significant trade-offs.Fine-tuning, while effective for baking in new information, is computationally expensive and slow. More critically, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where newly acquired knowledge overwrites previously learned data, degrading the model&#x27;s general performance.Conversely, non-parametric methods like RAG are fundamentally passive; they retrieve information based solely on semantic similarity, such as vector embeddings, without evaluating the actual utility of the information to the input query. This approach assumes that \"similar implies useful,\" which is often flawed in complex reasoning tasks. The researchers argue that human intelligence solves this problem by maintaining “the delicate balance between the stability of cognitive reasoning and the plasticity of episodic memory.” In the human brain, stable reasoning (associated with the cortex) is decoupled from dynamic episodic memory. This allows humans to adapt to new tasks without \"rewiring neural circuitry\" (the rough equivalent of model fine-tuning).Inside the MemRL frameworkInspired by humans’ use of episodic memory and cognitive reasoning, MemRL is designed to enable an agent to continuously improve its performance after deployment without compromising the stability of its backbone LLM. Instead of changing the model’s parameters, the framework shifts the adaptation mechanism to an external, self-evolving memory structure.In this architecture, the LLM&#x27;s parameters remain completely frozen. The model acts effectively as the \"cortex,\" responsible for general reasoning, logic, and code generation, but it is not responsible for storing specific successes or failures encountered after deployment. This structure ensures stable cognitive reasoning and prevents catastrophic forgetting.To handle adaptation, MemRL maintains a dynamic episodic memory component. Instead of storing plain text documents and static embedding values, as is common in RAG, MemRL organizes memory into \"intent-experience-utility\" triplets. These contain the user&#x27;s query (the intent), the specific solution trajectory or action taken (the experience), and a score, known as the Q-value, that represents how successful this specific experience was in the past (the utility).Crucially for enterprise architects, this new data structure doesn&#x27;t require ripping out existing infrastructure. \"MemRL is designed to be a &#x27;drop-in&#x27; replacement for the retrieval layer in existing technology stacks and is compatible with various vector databases,\" Muning Wen, a co-author of the paper and PhD candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, told VentureBeat. \"The existence and updating of &#x27;Q-Value&#x27; is solely for better evaluation and management of dynamic data... and is independent of the storage format.\"This utility score is the key differentiator from classic RAG systems. At inference time, MemRL agents employ a \"two-phase retrieval\" mechanism. First, the system identifies memories that are semantically close to the query to ensure relevance. It then re-ranks these candidates based on their Q-value, effectively prioritizing proven strategies.The framework incorporates reinforcement learning directly into the memory retrieval process. When an agent attempts a solution and receives environmental feedback (i.e., success or failure) it updates the Q-value of the retrieved memory. This creates a closed feedback loop: over time, the agent learns to ignore distractor memories and prioritize high-value strategies without ever needing to retrain the underlying LLM.While adding a reinforcement learning step might sound like it adds significant latency, Wen noted that the computational overhead is minimal. \"Our Q-value calculation is performed entirely on the CPU,\" he said.MemRL also possesses runtime continual learning capabilities. When the agent encounters a new scenario, the system uses the frozen LLM to summarize the new trajectory and adds it to the memory bank as a new triplet. This allows the agent to expand its knowledge base dynamically as it interacts with the world.It is worth noting that the automation of the value assignment comes with a risk: If the system mistakenly validates a bad interaction, the agent could learn the wrong lesson. Wen acknowledges this \"poisoned memory\" risk but notes that unlike black-box neural networks, MemRL remains transparent and auditable. \"If a bad interaction is mistakenly classified as a positive example... it may spread more widely,\" Wen said. \"However … we can easily fix it by removing the contaminated data from the memory bank or resetting their Q-values.\"MemRL in actionThe researchers evaluated MemRL against several baselines on four diverse industry benchmarks: BigCodeBench (code generation), ALFWorld (embodied navigation), Lifelong Agent Bench (OS and database interaction), and Humanity&#x27;s Last Exam (complex multidisciplinary reasoning). The results showed that MemRL consistently outperformed baselines in both runtime learning (improving during the session) and transfer learning (generalizing to unseen tasks).The advantages of this value-aware retrieval mechanism were most pronounced in exploration-heavy environments like ALFWorld. In this benchmark, which requires agents to navigate and interact with a simulated household environment, MemRL achieved a relative improvement of approximately 56% over MemP, another agentic memory framework. The researchers found that the reinforcement learning component effectively encouraged the agent to explore and discover solutions for complex tasks that similarity-based retrieval methods often failed to solve.When the memory bank was frozen and tested on held-out sets to measure generalization, MemRL achieved the highest accuracy across benchmarks. For example, on the Lifelong Agent Bench, it improved significantly upon the standard RAG baseline on OS tasks. This indicates that the system does not merely memorize training data but effectively filters out low-value memories to retain high-utility experiences that generalize to new situations.The broader picture for self-evolving agentsMemRL fits within a growing body of research focused on Memory-Based Markov Decision Processes (M-MDP), a formulation that frames memory retrieval as an active decision-making step rather than a passive search function. By treating retrieval as an action that can be optimized via reinforcement learning, frameworks like MemRL and similar approaches such as Memento are paving the way for more autonomous systems. For enterprise AI, this shift is significant. It suggests a future where agents can be deployed with a general-purpose LLM and then rapidly adapt to specific company workflows, proprietary databases, and unique problem sets through interaction alone. The key shift we’re seeing is frameworks that are treating applications as dynamic environments that they can learn from.These emerging capabilities will allow organizations to maintain consistent, high-performance agents that evolve alongside their business needs, solving the problem of stale models without incurring the prohibitive costs of constant retraining.It marks a transition in how we value data. \"In a future where static data is about to be exhausted, the interaction experience generated by each intelligent agent during its lifespan will become the new fuel,\" Wen said.",

          "title": "The best fitness trackers for 2026",
          "standfirst": "If you're looking to get fit, sleep better or just keep a closer eye on your health, a fitness wearable is a great place to start. Whether you're into intense workouts or just want to hit your step goal each day, the best fitness trackers available today can offer loads of helpful features, from sleep tracking and resting heart rate monitoring to built-in GPS and stress tracking. Some are even subtle enough to wear 24/7, like smart rings, while others double as stylish smartwatches.There are great options out there for beginners as well as more advanced users, and the variety of features means there’s something for every lifestyle and budget. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the best fitness trackers you can buy right now, and explain who each one is best suited for. Best fitness trackers for 2026 What do fitness trackers do best? The answer seems simple: Fitness wearables are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can help you reach your fitness goals too, but there are some areas where fitness bands and smart rings have proven to be the best buy: focus, design, better battery life, durability and price. When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their advanced health tracking abilities — things like all-day resting heart rate monitoring, stress tracking, and even detailed sleep tracker insights. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous gadget on their wrists all day. Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands offer between five and seven days of battery life — and that’s with all-day and all-night use even with sleep tracking features enabled. Many fitness trackers also slot nicely into your existing ecosystem, syncing seamlessly with your smartphone, other fitness apps and cloud storage to keep all your data in one place. When it comes to price point, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid smart band starting at $70. That makes them a great entry point for beginners who want to track their progress without committing to a full smartwatch. Yes, more expensive bands and smart rings exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space. When to get a smartwatch instead If you need a bit more from your wearable and don’t want to be limited to a fitness or activity tracker, a smartwatch may be the best buy for you. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and the best fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications. Just make sure your smartwatch is compatible with your Android or iPhone, however, before purchasing, as not all of them work with both operating systems. But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common. If you’re someone who’s seriously training — say for a race or an endurance challenge — a dedicated running watch may be worth considering. These often provide more in-depth cardio analytics, recovery insights, and real-time pace data that go beyond what standard trackers can deliver. Other fitness trackers we've tested Fitbit Inspire 3 The Fitbit Inspire 3 strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 6 and keeps only the essential tracking features. You won’t get built-in GPS tracking or Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get solid activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. The updated version has a sleeker design and includes a color touch display and connected GPS, the latter of which lets you track pace and distance while you run or bike outside while you have your phone with you. When compared to the Charge 6, the Inspire 3 is more fashionable, too. Its interchangeable bands let you switch up the look and feel of your tracker whenever you want, and it’s slim enough to blend in with other jewelry you might be wearing. We were also impressed by its multi-day battery life: Fitbit promises up to 10 days on a single charge, and that checked out for us. After four days of round-the-clock use, the Inspire 3 still had 66 percent battery left to go. Fitness tracker FAQs How long do fitness tracker batteries last? The battery life of fitness trackers can vary depending on the model and its features. On average, most fitness trackers last between five to seven days on a single charge. Basic models with limited features could stretch up to 10 days or more. However, more advanced trackers with features like continuous heart rate monitoring, GPS, or always-on displays may need recharging after one to three days. If you're using GPS or streaming music through your fitness tracker, you'll find that this drains the battery faster. By using these features less, or turning them off, you'll extend battery life.

          "title": "Why LinkedIn says prompting was a non-starter — and small models was the breakthrough",
          "standfirst": "LinkedIn is a leader in AI recommender systems, having developed them over the last 15-plus years. But getting to a next-gen recommendation stack for the job-seekers of tomorrow required a whole new technique. The company had to look beyond off-the-shelf models to achieve next-level accuracy, latency, and efficiency.“There was just no way we were gonna be able to do that through prompting,” Erran Berger, VP of product engineering at LinkedIn, says in a new Beyond the Pilot podcast. “We didn&#x27;t even try that for next-gen recommender systems because we realized it was a non-starter.”Instead, his team set to develop a highly detailed product policy document to fine-tune an initially massive 7-billion-parameter model; that was then further distilled into additional teacher and student models optimized to hundreds of millions of parameters. The technique has created a repeatable cookbook now reused across LinkedIn’s AI products. “Adopting this eval process end to end will drive substantial quality improvement of the likes we probably haven&#x27;t seen in years here at LinkedIn,” Berger says. Why multi-teacher distillation was a ‘breakthrough’ for LinkedIn Berger and his team set out to build an LLM that could interpret individual job queries, candidate profiles and job descriptions in real time, and in a way that mirrored LinkedIn’s product policy as accurately as possible. Working with the company&#x27;s product management team, engineers eventually built out a 20-to-30-page document scoring job description and profile pairs “across many dimensions.” “We did many, many iterations on this,” Berger says. That product policy document was then paired with a “golden dataset” comprising thousands of pairs of queries and profiles; the team fed this into ChatGPT during data generation and experimentation, prompting the model over time to learn scoring pairs and eventually generate a much larger synthetic data set to train a 7-billion-parameter teacher model.However, Berger says, it&#x27;s not enough to have an LLM running in production just on product policy. “At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a recommender system, and we need to do some amount of click prediction and personalization.” So, his team used that initial product policy-focused teacher model to develop a second teacher model oriented toward click prediction. Using the two, they further distilled a 1.7 billion parameter model for training purposes. That eventual student model was run through “many, many training runs,” and was optimized “at every point” to minimize quality loss, Berger says. This multi-teacher distillation technique allowed the team to “achieve a lot of affinity” to the original product policy and “land” click prediction, he says. They were also able to “modularize and componentize” the training process for the student.Consider it in the context of a chat agent with two different teacher models: One is training the agent on accuracy in responses, the other on tone and how it should communicate. Those two things are very different, yet critical, objectives, Berger notes. “By now mixing them, you get better outcomes, but also iterate on them independently,” he says. “That was a breakthrough for us.” Changing how teams work togetherBerger says he can’t understate the importance of anchoring on a product policy and an iterative eval process. Getting a “really, really good product policy” requires translating product manager domain expertise into a unified document. Historically, Berger notes, the product management team was laser focused on strategy and user experience, leaving modeling iteration approaches to ML engineers. Now, though, the two teams work together to “dial in” and create an aligned teacher model. “How product managers work with machine learning engineers now is very different from anything we&#x27;ve done previously,” he says. “It’s now a blueprint for basically any AI products we do at LinkedIn.”Watch the full podcast to hear more about: How LinkedIn optimized every step of the R&D process to support velocity, leading to real results with days or hours rather than weeks; Why teams should develop pipelines for plugability and experimentation and try out different models to support flexibility; The continued importance of traditional engineering debugging.You can also listen and subscribe to Beyond the Pilot on Spotify, Apple or wherever you get your podcasts.",

Getting a “really, really good product policy” requires translating product manager domain expertise into a unified document. Historically, Berger notes, the product management team was laser focused on strategy and user experience, leaving modeling iteration approaches to ML engineers. Now, though, the two teams work together to “dial in” and create an aligned teacher model. “How product managers work with machine learning engineers now is very different from anything we&#x27;ve done previously,” he says. “It’s now a blueprint for basically any AI products we do at LinkedIn.”Watch the full podcast to hear more about: How LinkedIn optimized every step of the R&D process to support velocity, leading to real results with days or hours rather than weeks; Why teams should develop pipelines for plugability and experimentation and try out different models to support flexibility; The continued importance of traditional engineering debugging.You can also listen and subscribe to Beyond the Pilot on Spotify, Apple or wherever you get your podcasts.",

Over-the-air updates that add more features, an all-touchscreen human-machine interface, large castings, and hands-free driver assists were all introduced or popularized by Tesla's electric vehicles, prompting other automakers to copy them, mostly in the hopes of seeing the same stratospheric gains in their stock prices. But starting on Valentine's Day, if you want your Tesla to steer itself, you'll have to pay a $99 monthly subscription fee. Tesla currently offers a pair of so-called \"level 2\" partially automated driver assist systems. Autopilot is the older of these, combining Tesla's adaptive cruise control (Tesla calls this TACC) and lane-keeping assist (Tesla calls this Autosteer). FSD is the newer system, meant to be more capable and for use on surface streets and divided-lane highways. Although the company and Tesla CEO Elon Musk regularly tout these systems' capabilities, both still require the human driver to provide situational awareness. But Autopilot has been under fire from regulators and the courts. Multiple wrongful death lawsuits are in the works, and after a high-profile loss resulting in a $329 million judgment against Tesla, expect many of these suits to be settled. Both the federal government and California have investigated whether Tesla misled customers, and in December, an administrative law judge ruled that Tesla indeed engaged in deceptive marketing by implying that its cars could drive themselves. The judge suspended Tesla's license to sell cars in California, a decision that the California Department of Motor Vehicles stayed for 60 days.Read full article Comments",

A lack of funding paused everything until late 2018, when Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund bought itself a stake. A billion dollars meant Lucid could build a factory—at the cost of alienating some former fans because of the source. Then the pandemic happened, further pushing back timelines as supply shortages took hold. But the Air did go on sale, and it has more recently been joined by the Gravity SUV.

The smallest of these birds of prey, a falcon called the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), flies through the region’s many cherry orchards and spends its days hunting for even tinier creatures to eat. This quest keeps the kestrels fed, but it also benefits the region’s cherry farmers. Fruit farmers have been working symbiotically with kestrels for decades, adding nesting boxes and reaping the benefits of the birds eliminating the mice, voles, songbirds, and other pests that wreak havoc by feeding on not-yet-harvested crops. In addition to limiting the crop damage caused by hungry critters, new research suggests kestrels also lower the risk of food-borne illnesses. The study, published in November in the Journal of Applied Ecology, suggests the kestrels help keep harmful pathogens off of fruit headed to consumers by eating and scaring off small birds that carry those pathogens. Orchards housing the birds in nest boxes saw fewer cherry-eating birds than orchards without kestrels on site. This translated to an 81 percent reduction in crop damage—such as bite marks or missing fruit—and a 66 percent decrease in branches contaminated with bird feces.Read full article Comments",

On a tiny island just off the coast of Sulawesi (a much larger island in Indonesia), a cave wall bears the stenciled outline of a person’s hand—and it’s at least 67,800 years old, according to a recent study. The hand stencil is now the world’s oldest work of art (at least until archaeologists find something even older), as well as the oldest evidence of our species on any of the islands that stretch between continental Asia and Australia. Adhi Oktaviana examines a slightly more recent hand stencil on the wall of Liang Metanduno. Credit: Oktaviana et al. 2026 Hands reaching out from the past Archaeologist Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency, and his colleagues have spent the last six years surveying 44 rock art sites, mostly caves, on Sulawesi’s southeastern peninsula and the handful of tiny “satellite islands” off its coast. They found 14 previously undocumented sites and used rock formations to date 11 individual pieces of rock art in eight caves—including the oldest human artwork discovered so far.Read full article Comments",

A year ago today, the US informed the WHO of its intent to exit, setting the clock for a one-year withdrawal period mandated in a 1948 joint resolution of Congress. But, in practice, the withdrawal was immediate, with the Trump administration cutting all ties with WHO upon the announcement. In explaining his reasoning for leaving the WHO, Trump referenced his long-standing complaints about the agency’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China. Trump had attempted to extract the US from WHO during his first term, but the Biden administration rescinded the withdrawal on the first day in office, well before the one-year notice period was reached. The joint resolution also stipulated that the US would have to pay its financial obligations in full before departing. But, that too has not been honored by the Trump administration. According to Stat, the US owed the WHO $278 million in dues, which are a percentage of each member state’s gross domestic product. That dues payment covered the country's 2024–2025 membership, as WHO runs on a two-year budget cycle.Read full article Comments",

Starting today, the feature is rolling out to all users who subscribe to Google AI Pro or AI Ultra. However, it will be a Labs feature that needs to be explicitly enabled (subscribers will be prompted to do this). Google tends to expand access to new AI features to free accounts later on, so free users will most likely get access to Personal Intelligence in the future. Whenever this option does land on your account, it's entirely optional and can be disabled at any time. If you decide to integrate your data with AI Mode, the search bot will be able to scan your Gmail and Google Photos. That's less extensive than the Gemini app version, which supports Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Gmail will probably be the biggest contributor to AI Mode—a great many life events involve confirmation emails. Traditional search results when you are logged in are adjusted based on your usage history, but this goes a step further.Read full article Comments",

Just say something like, \"I want to take a practice SAT test,\" and the chatbot will generate one complete with clickable buttons, graphs, and score analysis. Of course, generative AI can go off the rails and provide incorrect information, which is a problem when you're trying to learn things.

Amazon MGM Studios no doubt hopes to cash in on any lingering nostalgia with its forthcoming film, Masters of the Universe. Judging by the extended teaser trailer, we're getting an origin story for He-Man. It's not the first time someone has turned He-Man into a feature film: Dolph Lundgren starred in 1987's Masters of the Universe, a critical and box office bomb that also featured Frank Langella as arch-villain Skeletor. Its poor reception might have stemmed from the 1987 film deviating significantly from the original cartoon, angering fans. But frankly, it was just a bad, cheesy movie, though it still has its share of cult fans today. This latest big-screen live-action adaptation has been languishing in development hell for nearly two decades. There were rumors in 2007 that John Woo would direct a He-Man feature for Warner Bros., but the project never got the green light. Sony Pictures gained the rights in 2009, and there were multiple script rewrites and much shuffling of possible directors (with John Chu, McG, and David S. Goyer among the candidates).Read full article Comments",

The previous version of the agreement contained a general prohibition on robots, spiders, scrapers, and automated data gathering tools but did not mention AI agents or LLMs by name. At first glance, the phrase \"agentic commerce\" may sound like aspirational marketing jargon, but the tools are already here, and people are apparently using them.

The latest estimates show that perhaps millions were harmed in the days immediately after Elon Musk promoted Grok's undressing feature on his own X feed by posting a pic of himself in a bikini. Over just 11 days after Musk's post, Grok sexualized more than 3 million images, of which 23,000 were of children, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimated in research published Thursday.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When I reviewed the Switch 2 back in June, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that \"my Switch 2 will probably need something like the Nyxi Hyperion Pro, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable.\" Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the Hyperion 3, which was made available for preorder earlier this week ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience. While there are plenty of third-party controllers for the Switch 2, none of the current options mimic the official Joy-Cons' ability to connect magnetically to the console tablet itself (controllers designed to slide into the grooves on the original Switch tablet also can't hook to the successor console). The Hyperion 3 is the first Switch 2 controller to offer this magnetic connection, making it uniquely suited for handheld play on the system.Read full article Comments",

NASA, on Wednesday, January 21, revealed the contents of the Artemis II mission's Official Flight Kit (OFK), continuing a tradition dating back to the Apollo program of packing a duffel bag-sized pouch of symbolic and celebratory items to commemorate the flight and recognize the people behind it. The kit includes more than 2,300 items, including a handful of relics. \"This mission will bring together pieces of our earliest achievements in aviation, defining moments from human spaceflight and symbols of where we're headed next,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's administrator, said in a statement. \"Historical artifacts flying aboard Artemis II reflect the long arc of American exploration and the generations of innovators who made this moment possible.\"Read full article Comments",

The company has petitioned the judge to exclude certain research studies and articles around social media and youth mental health; any mention of a recent high-profile case involving teen suicide and social media content; and any references to Meta’s financial resources, the personal activities of employees, and Mark Zuckerberg’s time as a student at Harvard University. Meta’s requests to exclude information, known as motions in limine, are a standard part of pretrial proceedings, in which a party can ask a judge to determine in advance which evidence or arguments are permissible in court. This is to ensure the jury is presented with facts and not irrelevant or prejudicial information and that the defendant is granted a fair trial.Read full article Comments",
