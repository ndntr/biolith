The hosts are designed to “deepen your listening experience by sharing relevant stories, fan trivia, and fun commentary about your favorite music,” YouTube says in a blog post. If you want to see if you’re eligible to join YouTube Labs, which is dedicated to AI-focused experiments on the platform, to potentially try the feature out, check YouTube’s website; through the program, “a limited number of US-based participants can test early prototypes and experiments,” according the blog post. Even though I joined YouTube Labs, I don’t seem to have access to the experiment myself. I’ve been playing YouTube Music off my phone for a little while writing this article, and I haven’t heard the hosts just yet. Google has been steadily expanding the capabilities of the AI hosts with NotebookLM to help users review and study different topics, so trying out a similar idea to YouTube Music makes some sense. The new YouTube Labs program also follows Google’s broader Labs program for its AI experiments. Today, YouTube also announced that some of its Premium-only features have expanded to more platforms. For example, the jump ahead feature, which uses AI to skip to the most interesting part of a video, is now “fully available” on YouTube for TV and game consoles, YouTube says. (The feature started showing up for some TV users earlier this year.)",

All three outlets cite anonymous sources in reporting that the deal could be announced next week, with Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners reportedly interested in investing. The Wall Street Journal says the move \"would likely be the largest leveraged buyout ever.\" The Saudi PIF already had a roughly 9 percent stake in EA as of a year ago, making it one of the largest shareholders in the company.

          "content": "Sinclair Broadcasting and Nexstar Media Group, whose stations account for about 25 percent of ABCs national audience, will air Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show on their ABC affiliate stations once again. Sinclair and Nexstar had suspended airing Kimmel’s show under pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr after Disney reinstated Kimmel from a suspension earlier this week, but both companies chose to replace Jimmy Kimmel Live! with other programming even after Kimmel’s reinstatement. The show will be back this evening. In a statement, Sinclair downplayed the influence of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who last week threatened broadcasters that aired Kimmel’s show. The threats came after Kimmel made a joke about the alleged shooter of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, and they were almost immediately followed by Jimmy Kimmel Live!’s removal from Sinclair and Nexstar and his suspension at ABC. “Our decision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence,” Sinclair said. “Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations. While we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.” Sinclair said it’s had discussions with ABC where it “proposed measures to strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue, including a network-wide independent ombudsman.” The company adds that “while ABC and Disney have not yet adopted these measures, and Sinclair respects their right to make those decisions under our network affiliate agreements, we believe such measures could strengthen trust and accountability.” Nexstar also downplayed the influence of Carr, saying in its own statement that that its commitment to its principles has “guided our decisions throughout this process, independent of any external influence from government agencies or individuals.” The company said it has “had discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.” Disney SVP of strategic communications Richard Horrmann declined to comment. Update, September 26th: Added that Nexstar will also air Jimmy Kimmel Live! again starting tonight.",

That's the premise behind ongoing research at the University of Cambridge, where scientists are using satellite imagery and AI models to map potential hedgehog habitats across the UK by first identifying their favorite hiding spots: bramble patches. European hedgehog populations have declined by roughly 30 to 50 percent over the past decade, so tracking these nocturnal creatures across large areas remains difficult and expensive. Rather than searching for the hedgehogs directly, researcher Gabriel Mahler developed an AI model that identifies brambles, which are thorny shrubs that hedgehogs use for shelter and foraging, from satellite data. These small mammals rely on this type of dense vegetation for daytime shelter, nesting sites, and protection from predators. Brambles also attract insects and provide berries, supporting the invertebrate populations that hedgehogs eat.Read full article Comments",

She told doctors that for the past month she had developed severe nausea, non-bloody vomiting, and pain she described as a burning feeling that spread from her upper abdomen, through her right side, and around to her back. Nothing she did made it better. The doctors started collecting her medical history, which was lengthy. The woman had Type 2 diabetes, Stage 2 chronic kidney disease, opioid use disorder, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), among other conditions. While she was taking many medications, she noted that for the past year she had also been taking semaglutide, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, and had lost about 40 pounds (over 19 percent of her body weight).Read full article Comments",

One of the features that LG has included in attempts to appeal to this demographic is a remote control with numbers.

Yes, really. The new AI music hosts are supposed to provide a richer listening experience, according to YouTube. As you're listening to tunes, the AI will generate audio snippets similar to, but shorter than, the fake podcasts you can create in NotebookLM. The \"Beyond the Beat\" host will break in every so often with relevant stories, trivia, and commentary about your musical tastes. YouTube says this feature will appear when you are listening to mixes and radio stations. The experimental feature is intended to be a bit like having a radio host drop some playful banter while cueing up the next song. It sounds a bit like Spotify's AI DJ, but the YouTube AI doesn't create playlists like Spotify's robot. This is still generative AI, which comes with the risk of hallucinations and low-quality slop, neither of which belongs in your music.

As interest in DIY keyboards expands, there are plenty of things to obsess over, such as keycap sets, layout, knobs, and switches. But you have to get deep into the hobby before you realize there's something more important than all that: the stabilizers. Even if you have the fanciest switches and a monolithic aluminum case, bad stabilizers can make a keyboard feel and sound like garbage. Luckily, there's a growing ecosystem of weirdly fancy stabilizers that can upgrade your typing experience, packing an impressive amount of innovation into a few tiny bits of plastic and metal. What is a stabilizer, and why should you care? Most keys on a keyboard are small enough that they go up and down evenly, no matter where you press. That's not the case for longer keys: Space, Enter, Shift, Backspace, and, depending on the layout, a couple more on the number pad. These keys have wire assemblies underneath called stabilizers, which help them go up and down when the switch does.Read full article Comments",

Officials in DR Congo are struggling to respond to the outbreak, which is in a province known for its poor road networks, according to reporting by The Associated Press. Treating Ebola can require extensive resources, including protective equipment, medicines, and transportation to reach remote areas. Health facilities in the area of the outbreak are already overwhelmed and quickly running low on critical resources, including clean water and protective equipment.

On Sunday, Trump told Fox News that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox Corporation, would likely be part of the investor group taking over TikTok's US operations. That deal—which Trump claimed Thursday was tentatively approved by Chinese President Xi Jinping—was set up to ensure that TikTok complies with a law banning majority ownership of the app by a foreign adversary in order to protect Americans from spying or foreign influence on the algorithm.Read full article Comments",

The most common means of stabilizing the injured site and making recovery possible is metal-based grafts, implants usually made with titanium alloys. The problem with such implants is that they are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and it’s very hard to make them patient-specific. “3D printing has been highlighted as a novel approach to make such personalized implants, but this also requires substantial time and money,” said Jung Seung Lee, a biomedical engineering researcher at the Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.

As we previously reported, the order requires that any announcement of funding opportunities be reviewed by the head of the agency or someone they designate, which means a political appointee will have the ultimate say over what areas of science the US funds. Individual grants will also require clearance from a political appointee and \"must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President’s policy priorities.\" The order also instructs agencies to formalize the ability to cancel previously awarded grants at any time if they're considered \"no longer advance agency priorities.\" Until a system is in place to enforce the new rules, agencies are forbidden from starting new funding programs.Read full article Comments",

For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is based on 2020’s Android 11. Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS.

          "content": "Microsoft and Asus revealed the ROG Xbox Ally handheld PC gaming line in June and promised an October 16 launch date in August. But they waited all the way until Thursday night to reveal preorder pricing set at $599.99 for the base ROG Xbox Ally hardware and a whopping $999.99 for the souped-up ROG Xbox Ally X. Those prices put the baseline ROG Xbox Ally units in the same general price tier as competition like Valve's Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo's Legion Go S, and even Nintendo's Switch 2. But the higher-grade ROG Xbox Ally X is significantly more expensive than almost all competing gaming handhelds, thanks in part to components like a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and an NPU that Asus says will ensure it is ready for a future when \"AI enhancements\" are rolling out in new games. That may seem like overkill when Steam Deck users seem content using their handheld mainly for low-end games like Vampire Survivors and Hades. But Asus said that, in pre-release hardware tests, the ROG Xbox Ally X gets \"up to a 30% performance boost\" over 2024's ROG Ally X on high-end games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The newer hardware also gets \"up to twice the battery life\" over the ROG Ally X on a game like Hollow Knight Silksong, Asus said.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Welcome to Edition 8.12 of the Rocket Report! We often hear from satellite operators—from the military to venture-backed startups—about their appetite for more launch capacity. With so many rocket launches happening around the world, some might want to dismiss these statements as a corporate plea for more competition, and therefore lower prices. SpaceX is on pace to launch more than 150 times this year. China could end the year with more than 70 orbital launches. These are staggering numbers compared to global launch rates just a few years ago. But I'm convinced there's room for more alternatives for reliable (and reusable) rockets. All of the world's planned mega-constellations will need immense launch capacity just to get off the ground, and if successful, they'll go into regular replacement and replenishment cycles. Throw in the still-undefined Golden Dome missile shield and many nations' desire for a sovereign launch capability, and it's easy to see the demand curve going up.

Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Sharp words from Astra’s Chris Kemp. Chris Kemp, the chief executive officer of Astra, apparently didn't get the memo about playing nice with his competitors in the launch business. Kemp made some spicy remarks at the Berkeley Space Symposium 2025 earlier this month, billed as the largest undergraduate aerospace event at the university (see video of the talk). During the speech, Kemp periodically deviated from building up Astra to hurling insults at several of his competitors in the launch industry, Ars reports. To be fair to Kemp, some of his criticisms are not without a kernel of truth. But they are uncharacteristically rough all the same, especially given Astra's uneven-at-best launch record and financial solvency to date.Read full article Comments",

The results spurred the media to declare we’re living through an “insect apocalypse,” but the reasons behind their absence were unclear. Now, a joint team of Japanese and Australian scientists have completed a new, multi-year study designed to get us some answers. Insect microcosm “In our work, we focused on ants because we have systematic ways for collecting them,” says Alexander Mikheyev, an evolutionary biologist at the Australian National University. “They are also a group with the right level of diversity, where you have enough species to do comparative studies.” Choosing the right location, he explained, was just as important. “We did it in Fiji, because Fiji had the right balance between isolation—which gave us a discrete group of animals to study—but at the same time was diverse enough to make comparisons,” Mikheyev adds. Thus, the Fijian archipelago, with its 330 islands, became the model the team used to get some insights into insect population dynamics. A key difference from the earlier study was that Mikheyev and his colleagues could look at those populations across thousands of years, not just the last 25.Read full article Comments",
