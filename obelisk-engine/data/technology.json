As a result, the UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.\" Reports surfaced in February that the UK served Apple with a secret order, known as a Technical Capability Notice, under its Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) or so-called \"Snoopers' Charter.\" Apple appealed the order and refused to break its end-to-end encryption, opting instead to remove iCloud's Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market.Read full article Comments",

The outbreak has contributed to the worst year for measles cases in the United States in more than 30 years. As of August 5, the most recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,356 confirmed measles cases have been reported across the country this year. For comparison, there were just 285 measles cases in 2024. The Texas outbreak began in January in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates. More than two-thirds of the state’s reported cases were in children, and two children in Texas died of the virus. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 99 people were hospitalized, representing 13 percent of cases.Read full article Comments",

Those include spreading misinformation about lifesaving vaccines; firing all 17 esteemed CDC vaccine advisors under the false pretense that they had disqualifying conflicts of interest; replacing those advisors with unqualified committee members who share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views; and unilaterally restricting access to COVID-19 vaccines without any evidence-based explanation. Prior to the release of the vaccine schedule, the AAP boycotted the first meeting of Kennedy's hand-selected CDC vaccine advisors in June, saying the committee's work is \"no longer a credible process.\" In July, the organization filed a lawsuit—alongside other medical groups— against the US health department over Kennedy's changes to the federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.Read full article Comments",

We even got a glimpse of a Deathclaw. (Minor spoilers for S1 below.) For the uninitiated, Fallout is set two centuries after nuclear warfare between the US and China destroyed civilization in 2077—an alternate history version of 2077, in which post-World War II nuclear technology ushered in a retrofuturistic society.

SpaceX complained that Louisiana proposed awarding 91.5 percent of funds to fiber Internet service providers instead of to the Starlink satellite system. SpaceX alleged that Louisiana was influenced by \"a legion of fiber lobbyists and other hangers-on seeking to personally benefit from massive taxpayer spending.\" The Trump administration rewrote rules for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program in a way that benefits Starlink. Instead of prioritizing fiber networks that offer better service and are more future-proof, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a \"tech-neutral approach\" and lower the average cost of serving each location.Read full article Comments",

Chewing betel nuts is a cultural practice in parts of Southeast Asia. When chewed, these reddish nuts, which are the fruit of the areca palm, release psychoactive compounds that heighten alertness and energy, promote feelings of euphoria, and help with relaxation. They are usually wrapped in betel leaves with lime paste made from powdered shells or corals, depending on the region. Critically, the ancient teeth from betel nut chewers are distinguishable because of red staining. So when archaeologist Piyawit Moonkham, of Chiang Mai University in Thailand, unearthed 4,000-year-old skeletons from the Bronze Age burial site of Nong Ratchawat, the lack of telltale red stains appeared to indicate that the individuals they belonged to were not chewers of betel nuts.Read full article Comments",

It has proposed budgets that would be catastrophic, stopped the flow of research funds to a number of universities, and sought to exert unprecedented political control over what funding is distributed. Money has been repeatedly delayed as grants have been checked and rechecked for ideological issues. And all of that is before we get to the instances where the administration has attempted to undermine specific scientific results. But, somewhat unexpectedly, everything isn't currently dark for US-based scientists, as recent budget appropriations in the Senate have ignored Trump's requests (and budget guidance passed by the Senate itself) and have funded research at levels similar to previous years. That funding may ultimately set up a confrontation between a Congress that wants to fund science, and a president who has little interest in doing so—a confrontation the administration appears to be preparing for. Project 2025 and science The president himself appears to be completely indifferent to science, being willing to simply make things up as needed, with no regard for evidence. Instead, most of the attacks on research funding have come from a combination of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The latter is helmed by Russell Vought, who helped produce the Project 2025 document that outlined many of the actions taken by the new administration.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Serious badminton players are constantly exploring different techniques to give them an edge over opponents. One of the latest innovations is the spin serve, a devastatingly effective method in which a player adds a pre-spin just before the racket contacts the shuttlecock (aka the birdie). It's so effective—some have called it \"impossible to return\"—that the Badminton World Federation (BWF) banned the spin serve in 2023, at least until after the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. The sanction wasn't meant to quash innovation but to address players' concerns about the possible unfair advantages the spin serve conferred. The BWF thought that international tournaments shouldn't become the test bed for the technique, which is markedly similar to the previously banned \"Sidek serve.\" The BWF permanently banned the spin serve earlier this year. Chinese physicists have now teased out the complex fundamental physics of the spin serve, publishing their findings in the journal Physics of Fluids. Shuttlecocks are unique among the various projectiles used in different sports due to their open conical shape. Sixteen overlapping feathers protrude from a rounded cork base that is usually covered in thin leather. The birdies one uses for leisurely backyard play might be synthetic nylon, but serious players prefer actual feathers.Read full article Comments",

Smaller than the current model on the outside but with more room inside, it's also more efficient and finally uses a liquid-cooled battery. But we knew all that back at the start of summer. What we didn't know then was how much the Leaf will cost. As we noted back in June, pricing is most likely to determine the Leaf's success or failure. None of the improvements to this electric vehicle will matter if it's too expensive. Happily, that doesn't appear to be the case. The Leaf S+ is the base model, with a 75 kWh long-range battery and a range of 303 miles (487 km)—it will cost $29,990 when it goes on sale this fall. That makes it cheaper than the original car when it first went on sale back in 2011, and that's before taking inflation into account. \"We've stuck to our mission of engineering EVs that are affordable but packed with value. That's how we've kept the LEAF's price steady over three generations—all while giving owners more style, more technology, more features and a vastly improved driving range over the original 2011 model,\" said Nissan Senior Vice President of US Marketing and Sales Vinay Shahani.Read full article Comments",

The Crater of Diamonds site hosted multiple commercial mining attempts between 1906 (when John Wesley Huddleston found the first diamonds) and the park's opening in 1972.

The new screen will cost $40 and is available starting today from Pi resellers like CanaKit, Vilros, and PiShop (though some of those retailers already list it slightly above the MSRP). \"Its capacitive touch screen works out of the box with full Linux driver support—no manual calibration required, no hunting through device trees, and no wrestling with incompatible touch controllers,\" writes Raspberry Pi software CTO Gordon Hollingworth in the company's blog post.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ostensibly, C:\\ArsGames is to some extent about actually driving a few game purchases, but in reality it's mostly an excuse for me and my colleagues to wax nostalgic about the games that were formative for us. Case in point: This entry in our ongoing series with GOG is about a game that's completely free. I think Ars can withstand this tiny revenue shortfall for the sake of peak nostalgia! There are a couple of reasons I chose The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall this time around: its co-creator, Julian LeFay, recently passed away, so it seemed timely. Also, it was one of the defining games of my youth—one I have continued to revisit now and then. But it's also interesting because of where its developer, Bethesda—a studio people both love and hate—is at today. Going back to Daggerfall, we find a game that shows off so much of what we've lost from the bygone era of '90s PC gaming, but also one that makes it abundantly clear why the industry left those sensibilities behind.Read full article Comments",
