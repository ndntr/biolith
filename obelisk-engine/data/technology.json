          "content": "Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country's communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, announced yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities. AGCOM issued the fine under Italy's controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company's annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent. The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren't subject to the dispute over piracy.Read full article Comments",

          "standfirst": "Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, was out in full force covering the show. The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It's appropriate, I guess, that as we're beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry's insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI's supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.We're by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it's fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA's marathon keynote and Lenovo's somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it's been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of weird new gadgets, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.If you've been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there's still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBest robot: Switchbot Onero H1Onero H1 robotOneroWe saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot's Onero H1, which we watched pick up clothes and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year. The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It's also kind of cute. The company hasn't said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we'll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterBest accessibility tech: WheelMoveWheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairsCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetWheelMove offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It's portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn't overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editorBest TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)LG OLED Evo W6 \"Wallpaper TV\"LGI’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like LG’s OLED Evo W6. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest AI hardware: Subtle VoicebudsSubtle VoicebudsSubtleSubtle’s Voicebuds are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it's below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, and you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart homeIKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb rangeIKEAThe best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots. It seems every other company, from Bosch to LG to Samsung, had one or both of the buzzy technologies baked into their new smart home offerings. But IKEA came to its first CES with a simple lineup of basic, Matter-enabled smart plugs, sensors, lamps and remotes at screamingly good prices. Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff. There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own DIRIGERA or use a Matter hub you already own. The new lineup should land at IKEA’s website and stores sometime in January. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterBest home theater: Samsung HW-QS90HSamsung HW-QS90H soundbarBilly Steele for EngadgetMany companies claim their soundbars have enough bass that you don’t need a separate subwoofer. Those promises rarely pan out, even when the company devises new technology to solve the problem. With the HW-QS90H, Samsung is pledging to do the same with its Quad Bass woofer system. Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest audio: Shokz OpenFit ProShokz OpenFit ProShokzWhen it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off. Shokz is one of the few that has cracked the code with its OpenFit Pro. The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1Tone Outdoors T1Whisper AeroOutdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear. Tone Outdoors isn’t your usual power tool outfit though; it’s a spin-off of the aerospace engineering company Whisper Aero. Through its development of quieter electric airplane engines, Whisper Aero realized its technology had other uses. Enter the T1 leaf blower.The T1 is significantly quieter than most handheld gas models, clocking in at just 52 decibels of peak noise on average. It’s also more powerful than most of them with 880 CFM of airflow volume. The T1 can run longer too, and an upcoming backpack will extend run time for several hours. But the most important advancement here is not annoying your neighbors — or yourself — when it’s time to do some yard work. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest toy: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoLego is constantly evolving, but rarely does it make as big a move as it did with Smart Play. The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life. The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego's Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader's TIE fighter, and you'll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don't need to know how it works — it just does. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editorBest PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16The Dell XPS 14 and 16.DellIn a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself. Last year, Dell showed up with a new naming scheme for all of its hardware that included replacing the iconic XPS line with the word “Premium.” And despite our objections, the company followed through with the rebrand. But now at CES 2026, not only has Dell admitted its mistake, it’s righting wrongs with two new members of the XPS family that are exactly what we wanted all along.On the XPS 14 and XPS 16, we’re getting brand new chassis featuring the latest chips from Intel, gorgeous tandem OLED displays and precision engineering that embodies everything we loved about XPS laptops from previous years. Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor. But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet. There are also placeholders for two more XPS models slated to arrive in the not too distant future. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest health tech: Eyebot vision test boothEyebot vision testEyebotWouldn’t it be nice if getting an updated eyeglasses prescription wasn’t as lengthy a process as it is right now? Eyebot’s new kiosk is designed to automate the process of visiting a doctor’s office to three minutes rocking up to a machine. It uses a combination of analog and digital wizardry to identify what you need to see properly in no time at all. Even better is that the prescriptions have to be signed off by a licensed eye doctor, so you can still rely on a degree of professional rigor. We like Eyebot because it proved itself in our tests: its brief examination matched my professionally completed prescription from last year. But its ability to make effective eye care accessible and affordable in a way that it isn’t at present is even more compelling than the tech itself. — Daniel Cooper, Senior reporterBest gaming tech: ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUSThe ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo is big, weird and potentially awkward to set up. But honestly, what kind of gamer doesn’t want more screens? Even if you can’t use its second display in the middle of a firefight, more real estate means extra room for Discord, build guides or anything else you might need. Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos. You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSamsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the Galaxy Z TriFold in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor. The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefMost promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovoConcept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market. But with the Legion Pro Rollable concept, Lenovo created something with a simple yet powerful premise: A gaming laptop with a screen that gets wider at the touch of a button.To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo took a regular Legion Pro 7i and then swapped its standard 16-inch display for a flexible one that can expand all the way up to 23.8 inches — with a bonus stop in between. This means you have the option to choose from 16:10, 21:9 or even 24:9 depending on the situation, which feels like an incredible way to enhance racing games, flight sims and anything else that can take advantage of extra wide aspect ratios. Granted, when its screen is fully deployed, it does look a bit ungainly. But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest emerging technology: IXI autofocus lensesIXI Autofocus lensesIXIIXI’s autofocusing glasses were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user's eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds. Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription.

          "content": "Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, was out in full force covering the show. The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It's appropriate, I guess, that as we're beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry's insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI's supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.We're by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it's fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA's marathon keynote and Lenovo's somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it's been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of weird new gadgets, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.If you've been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there's still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBest robot: Switchbot Onero H1Onero H1 robotOneroWe saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot's Onero H1, which we watched pick up clothes and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year. The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It's also kind of cute. The company hasn't said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we'll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterBest accessibility tech: WheelMoveWheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairsCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetWheelMove offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It's portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn't overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editorBest TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)LG OLED Evo W6 \"Wallpaper TV\"LGI’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like LG’s OLED Evo W6. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest AI hardware: Subtle VoicebudsSubtle VoicebudsSubtleSubtle’s Voicebuds are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it's below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, and you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart homeIKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb rangeIKEAThe best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots. It seems every other company, from Bosch to LG to Samsung, had one or both of the buzzy technologies baked into their new smart home offerings. But IKEA came to its first CES with a simple lineup of basic, Matter-enabled smart plugs, sensors, lamps and remotes at screamingly good prices. Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff. There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own DIRIGERA or use a Matter hub you already own. The new lineup should land at IKEA’s website and stores sometime in January. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterBest home theater: Samsung HW-QS90HSamsung HW-QS90H soundbarBilly Steele for EngadgetMany companies claim their soundbars have enough bass that you don’t need a separate subwoofer. Those promises rarely pan out, even when the company devises new technology to solve the problem. With the HW-QS90H, Samsung is pledging to do the same with its Quad Bass woofer system. Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest audio: Shokz OpenFit ProShokz OpenFit ProShokzWhen it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off. Shokz is one of the few that has cracked the code with its OpenFit Pro. The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1Tone Outdoors T1Whisper AeroOutdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear. Tone Outdoors isn’t your usual power tool outfit though; it’s a spin-off of the aerospace engineering company Whisper Aero. Through its development of quieter electric airplane engines, Whisper Aero realized its technology had other uses. Enter the T1 leaf blower.The T1 is significantly quieter than most handheld gas models, clocking in at just 52 decibels of peak noise on average. It’s also more powerful than most of them with 880 CFM of airflow volume. The T1 can run longer too, and an upcoming backpack will extend run time for several hours. But the most important advancement here is not annoying your neighbors — or yourself — when it’s time to do some yard work. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest toy: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoLego is constantly evolving, but rarely does it make as big a move as it did with Smart Play. The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life. The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego's Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader's TIE fighter, and you'll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don't need to know how it works — it just does. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editorBest PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16The Dell XPS 14 and 16.DellIn a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself. Last year, Dell showed up with a new naming scheme for all of its hardware that included replacing the iconic XPS line with the word “Premium.” And despite our objections, the company followed through with the rebrand. But now at CES 2026, not only has Dell admitted its mistake, it’s righting wrongs with two new members of the XPS family that are exactly what we wanted all along.On the XPS 14 and XPS 16, we’re getting brand new chassis featuring the latest chips from Intel, gorgeous tandem OLED displays and precision engineering that embodies everything we loved about XPS laptops from previous years. Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor. But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet. There are also placeholders for two more XPS models slated to arrive in the not too distant future. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest health tech: Eyebot vision test boothEyebot vision testEyebotWouldn’t it be nice if getting an updated eyeglasses prescription wasn’t as lengthy a process as it is right now? Eyebot’s new kiosk is designed to automate the process of visiting a doctor’s office to three minutes rocking up to a machine. It uses a combination of analog and digital wizardry to identify what you need to see properly in no time at all. Even better is that the prescriptions have to be signed off by a licensed eye doctor, so you can still rely on a degree of professional rigor. We like Eyebot because it proved itself in our tests: its brief examination matched my professionally completed prescription from last year. But its ability to make effective eye care accessible and affordable in a way that it isn’t at present is even more compelling than the tech itself. — Daniel Cooper, Senior reporterBest gaming tech: ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUSThe ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo is big, weird and potentially awkward to set up. But honestly, what kind of gamer doesn’t want more screens? Even if you can’t use its second display in the middle of a firefight, more real estate means extra room for Discord, build guides or anything else you might need. Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos. You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSamsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the Galaxy Z TriFold in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor. The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefMost promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovoConcept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market. But with the Legion Pro Rollable concept, Lenovo created something with a simple yet powerful premise: A gaming laptop with a screen that gets wider at the touch of a button.To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo took a regular Legion Pro 7i and then swapped its standard 16-inch display for a flexible one that can expand all the way up to 23.8 inches — with a bonus stop in between. This means you have the option to choose from 16:10, 21:9 or even 24:9 depending on the situation, which feels like an incredible way to enhance racing games, flight sims and anything else that can take advantage of extra wide aspect ratios. Granted, when its screen is fully deployed, it does look a bit ungainly. But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest emerging technology: IXI autofocus lensesIXI Autofocus lensesIXIIXI’s autofocusing glasses were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user's eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds. Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription. Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe. The company has a busy year ahead as it turns its technology into a consumer product. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefBest in show: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoThere's perhaps no place better than CES to highlight how quickly industry trends die.

          "title": "Anthropic cracks down on unauthorized Claude usage by third-party harnesses and rivals",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic has confirmed the implementation of strict new technical safeguards preventing third-party applications from spoofing its official coding client, Claude Code, in order to access the underlying Claude AI models for more favorably pricing and limits — a move that has disrupted workflows for users of popular open source coding agent OpenCode. Simultaneously but separately, it has restricted usage of its AI models by rival labs including xAI (through the integrated developer environment Cursor) to train competing systems to Claude Code. The former action was clarified on Friday by Thariq Shihipar, a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic working on Claude Code. Writing on the social network X (formerly Twitter), Shihipar stated that the company had \"tightened our safeguards against spoofing the Claude Code harness.\"He acknowledged that the rollout had unintended collateral damage, noting that some user accounts were automatically banned for triggering abuse filters—an error the company is currently reversing. However, the blocking of the third-party integrations themselves appears to be intentional.The move targets harnesses—software wrappers that pilot a user’s web-based Claude account via OAuth to drive automated workflows. This effectively severs the link between flat-rate consumer Claude Pro/Max plans and external coding environments. The Harness ProblemA harness acts as a bridge between a subscription (designed for human chat) and an automated workflow. Tools like OpenCode work by spoofing the client identity, sending headers that convince the Anthropic server the request is coming from its own official command line interface (CLI) tool.Shihipar cited technical instability as the primary driver for the block, noting that unauthorized harnesses introduce bugs and usage patterns that Anthropic cannot properly diagnose. When a third-party wrapper like Cursor (in certain configurations) or OpenCode hits an error, users often blame the model, degrading trust in the platform.The Economic Tension: The Buffet AnalogyHowever, the developer community has pointed to a simpler economic reality underlying the restrictions on Cursor and similar tools: Cost.In extensive discussions on Hacker News beginning yesterday, users coalesced around a buffet analogy: Anthropic offers an all-you-can-eat buffet via its consumer subscription ($200/month for Max) but restricts the speed of consumption via its official tool, Claude Code.Third-party harnesses remove these speed limits. An autonomous agent running inside OpenCode can execute high-intensity loops—coding, testing, and fixing errors overnight—that would be cost-prohibitive on a metered plan.\"In a month of Claude Code, it&#x27;s easy to use so many LLM tokens that it would have cost you more than $1,000 if you&#x27;d paid via the API,\" noted Hacker News user dfabulich.By blocking these harnesses, Anthropic is forcing high-volume automation toward two sanctioned paths:The Commercial API: Metered, per-token pricing which captures the true cost of agentic loops.Claude Code: Anthropic’s managed environment, where they control the rate limits and execution sandbox.Community Pivot: Cat and MouseThe reaction from users has been swift and largely negative. \"Seems very customer hostile,\" wrote Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the creator of the popular Ruby on Rails open source web development framework, in a post on X. However, others were more sympathetic to Anthropic. \"anthropic crackdown on people abusing the subscription auth is the gentlest it could’ve been,\" wrote Artem K aka @banteg on X, a developer associated with Yearn Finance. \"just a polite message instead of nuking your account or retroactively charging you at api prices.\"The team behind OpenCode immediately launched OpenCode Black, a new premium tier for $200 per month that reportedly routes traffic through an enterprise API gateway to bypass the consumer OAuth restrictions.In addition, OpenCode creator Dax Raad posted on X saying that the company would be working with Anthropic rival OpenAI to allow users of its coding model and development agent, Codex, \"to benefit from their subscription directly within OpenCode,\" and then posted a GIF of the unforgettable scene from the 2000 film Gladiator showing Maximus (Russell Crowe) asking a crowd \"Are you not entertained?\" after chopping off an adversary&#x27;s head with two swords.For now, the message from Anthropic is clear: The ecosystem is consolidating. Whether via legal enforcement (as seen with xAI&#x27;s use of Cursor) or technical safeguards, the era of unrestricted access to Claude’s reasoning capabilities is coming to an end.The xAI Situation and Cursor ConnectionSimultaneous with the technical crackdown, developers at Elon Musk’s competing AI lab xAI have reportedly lost access to Anthropic’s Claude models. While the timing suggests a unified strategy, sources familiar with the matter indicate this is a separate enforcement action based on commercial terms, with Cursor playing a pivotal role in the discovery.As first reported by tech journalist Kylie Robison of the publication Core Memory, xAI staff had been using Anthropic models—specifically via the Cursor IDE—to accelerate their own developmet.\"Hi team, I believe many of you have already discovered that Anthropic models are not responding on Cursor,\" wrote xAI co-founder Tony Wu in a memo to staff on Wednesday, according to Robison. \"According to Cursor this is a new policy Anthropic is enforcing for all its major competitors.\"However, Section D.4 (Use Restrictions) of Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service expressly prohibits customers from using the services to:(a) access the Services to build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models... [or] (b) reverse engineer or duplicate the Services.In this instance, Cursor served as the vehicle for the violation. While the IDE itself is a legitimate tool, xAI&#x27;s specific use of it to leverage Claude for competitive research triggered the legal block.Precedent for the Block: The OpenAI and Windsurf CutoffsThe restriction on xAI is not the first time Anthropic has used its Terms of Service or infrastructure control to wall off a major competitor or third-party tool. This week’s actions follow a clear pattern established throughout 2025, where Anthropic aggressively moved to protect its intellectual property and computing resources.In August 2025, the company revoked OpenAI&#x27;s access to the Claude APIunder strikingly similar circumstances. Sources told Wired that OpenAI had been using Claude to benchmark its own models and test safety responses—a practice Anthropic flagged as a violation of its competitive restrictions.\"Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI&#x27;s own technical staff were also using our coding tools,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said at the time.Just months prior, in June 2025, the coding environment Windsurf faced a similar sudden blackout. In a public statement, the Windsurf team revealed that \"with less than a week of notice, Anthropic informed us they were cutting off nearly all of our first-party capacity\" for the Claude 3.x model family. The move forced Windsurf to immediately strip direct access for free users and pivot to a \"Bring-Your-Own-Key\" (BYOK) model while promoting Google’s Gemini as a stable alternative.While Windsurf eventually restored first-party access for paid users weeks later, the incident—combined with the OpenAI revocation and now the xAI block—reinforces a rigid boundary in the AI arms race: while labs and tools may coexist, Anthropic reserves the right to sever the connection the moment usage threatens its competitive advantage or business model.The Catalyst: The Viral Rise of &#x27;Claude Code&#x27;The timing of both crackdowns is inextricably linked to the massive surge in popularity for Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s native terminal environment.While Claude Code was originally released in early 2025, it spent much of the year as a niche utility. The true breakout moment arrived only in December 2025 and the first days of January 2026—driven less by official updates and more by the community-led \"Ralph Wiggum\" phenomenon.Named after the dim-witted Simpsons character, the Ralph Wiggum plugin popularized a method of \"brute force\" coding. By trapping Claude in a self-healing loop where failures are fed back into the context window until the code passes tests, developers achieved results that felt surprisingly close to AGI.But the current controversy isn&#x27;t over users losing access to the Claude Code interface—which many power users actually find limiting—but rather the underlying engine, the Claude Opus 4.5 model. By spoofing the official Claude Code client, tools like OpenCode allowed developers to harness Anthropic&#x27;s most powerful reasoning model for complex, autonomous loops at a flat subscription rate, effectively arbitraging the difference between consumer pricing and enterprise-grade intelligence.In fact, as developer Ed Andersen wrote on X, some of the popularity of Claude Code may have been driven by people spoofing it in this manner.Clearly, power users wanted to run it at massive scales without paying enterprise rates. Anthropic’s new enforcement actions are a direct attempt to funnel this runaway demand back into its sanctioned, sustainable channels.Enterprise Dev TakeawaysFor Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and scalability, this shift demands an immediate re-architecture of pipelines to prioritize stability over raw cost savings. While tools like OpenCode offered an attractive flat-rate alternative for heavy automation, Anthropic’s crackdown reveals that these unauthorized wrappers introduce undiagnosable bugs and instability. Ensuring model integrity now requires routing all automated agents through the official Commercial API or the Claude Code client. Therefore, enterprise decision makers should take note: even though open source solutions may be more affordable and more tempting, if they&#x27;re being used to access proprietary AI models like Anthropic&#x27;s, access is not always guaranteed.This transition necessitates a re-forecasting of operational budgets—moving from predictable monthly subscriptions to variable per-token billing—but ultimately trades financial predictability for the assurance of a supported, production-ready environment.From a security and compliance perspective, the simultaneous blocks on xAI and open-source tools expose the critical vulnerability of \"Shadow AI.\" When engineering teams use personal accounts or spoofed tokens to bypass enterprise controls, they risk not just technical debt but sudden, organization-wide access loss. Security directors must now audit internal toolchains to ensure that no \"dogfooding\" of competitor models violates commercial terms and that all automated workflows are authenticated via proper enterprise keys. In this new landscape, the reliability of the official API must trump the cost savings of unauthorized tools, as the operational risk of a total ban far outweighs the expense of proper integration.",

However, others were more sympathetic to Anthropic. \"anthropic crackdown on people abusing the subscription auth is the gentlest it could’ve been,\" wrote Artem K aka @banteg on X, a developer associated with Yearn Finance. \"just a polite message instead of nuking your account or retroactively charging you at api prices.\"The team behind OpenCode immediately launched OpenCode Black, a new premium tier for $200 per month that reportedly routes traffic through an enterprise API gateway to bypass the consumer OAuth restrictions.In addition, OpenCode creator Dax Raad posted on X saying that the company would be working with Anthropic rival OpenAI to allow users of its coding model and development agent, Codex, \"to benefit from their subscription directly within OpenCode,\" and then posted a GIF of the unforgettable scene from the 2000 film Gladiator showing Maximus (Russell Crowe) asking a crowd \"Are you not entertained?\" after chopping off an adversary&#x27;s head with two swords.For now, the message from Anthropic is clear: The ecosystem is consolidating. Whether via legal enforcement (as seen with xAI&#x27;s use of Cursor) or technical safeguards, the era of unrestricted access to Claude’s reasoning capabilities is coming to an end.The xAI Situation and Cursor ConnectionSimultaneous with the technical crackdown, developers at Elon Musk’s competing AI lab xAI have reportedly lost access to Anthropic’s Claude models. While the timing suggests a unified strategy, sources familiar with the matter indicate this is a separate enforcement action based on commercial terms, with Cursor playing a pivotal role in the discovery.As first reported by tech journalist Kylie Robison of the publication Core Memory, xAI staff had been using Anthropic models—specifically via the Cursor IDE—to accelerate their own developmet.\"Hi team, I believe many of you have already discovered that Anthropic models are not responding on Cursor,\" wrote xAI co-founder Tony Wu in a memo to staff on Wednesday, according to Robison. \"According to Cursor this is a new policy Anthropic is enforcing for all its major competitors.\"However, Section D.4 (Use Restrictions) of Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service expressly prohibits customers from using the services to:(a) access the Services to build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models... [or] (b) reverse engineer or duplicate the Services.In this instance, Cursor served as the vehicle for the violation. While the IDE itself is a legitimate tool, xAI&#x27;s specific use of it to leverage Claude for competitive research triggered the legal block.Precedent for the Block: The OpenAI and Windsurf CutoffsThe restriction on xAI is not the first time Anthropic has used its Terms of Service or infrastructure control to wall off a major competitor or third-party tool. This week’s actions follow a clear pattern established throughout 2025, where Anthropic aggressively moved to protect its intellectual property and computing resources.In August 2025, the company revoked OpenAI&#x27;s access to the Claude APIunder strikingly similar circumstances. Sources told Wired that OpenAI had been using Claude to benchmark its own models and test safety responses—a practice Anthropic flagged as a violation of its competitive restrictions.\"Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI&#x27;s own technical staff were also using our coding tools,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said at the time.Just months prior, in June 2025, the coding environment Windsurf faced a similar sudden blackout. In a public statement, the Windsurf team revealed that \"with less than a week of notice, Anthropic informed us they were cutting off nearly all of our first-party capacity\" for the Claude 3.x model family. The move forced Windsurf to immediately strip direct access for free users and pivot to a \"Bring-Your-Own-Key\" (BYOK) model while promoting Google’s Gemini as a stable alternative.While Windsurf eventually restored first-party access for paid users weeks later, the incident—combined with the OpenAI revocation and now the xAI block—reinforces a rigid boundary in the AI arms race: while labs and tools may coexist, Anthropic reserves the right to sever the connection the moment usage threatens its competitive advantage or business model.The Catalyst: The Viral Rise of &#x27;Claude Code&#x27;The timing of both crackdowns is inextricably linked to the massive surge in popularity for Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s native terminal environment.While Claude Code was originally released in early 2025, it spent much of the year as a niche utility. The true breakout moment arrived only in December 2025 and the first days of January 2026—driven less by official updates and more by the community-led \"Ralph Wiggum\" phenomenon.Named after the dim-witted Simpsons character, the Ralph Wiggum plugin popularized a method of \"brute force\" coding. By trapping Claude in a self-healing loop where failures are fed back into the context window until the code passes tests, developers achieved results that felt surprisingly close to AGI.But the current controversy isn&#x27;t over users losing access to the Claude Code interface—which many power users actually find limiting—but rather the underlying engine, the Claude Opus 4.5 model. By spoofing the official Claude Code client, tools like OpenCode allowed developers to harness Anthropic&#x27;s most powerful reasoning model for complex, autonomous loops at a flat subscription rate, effectively arbitraging the difference between consumer pricing and enterprise-grade intelligence.In fact, as developer Ed Andersen wrote on X, some of the popularity of Claude Code may have been driven by people spoofing it in this manner.Clearly, power users wanted to run it at massive scales without paying enterprise rates. Anthropic’s new enforcement actions are a direct attempt to funnel this runaway demand back into its sanctioned, sustainable channels.Enterprise Dev TakeawaysFor Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and scalability, this shift demands an immediate re-architecture of pipelines to prioritize stability over raw cost savings. While tools like OpenCode offered an attractive flat-rate alternative for heavy automation, Anthropic’s crackdown reveals that these unauthorized wrappers introduce undiagnosable bugs and instability. Ensuring model integrity now requires routing all automated agents through the official Commercial API or the Claude Code client. Therefore, enterprise decision makers should take note: even though open source solutions may be more affordable and more tempting, if they&#x27;re being used to access proprietary AI models like Anthropic&#x27;s, access is not always guaranteed.This transition necessitates a re-forecasting of operational budgets—moving from predictable monthly subscriptions to variable per-token billing—but ultimately trades financial predictability for the assurance of a supported, production-ready environment.From a security and compliance perspective, the simultaneous blocks on xAI and open-source tools expose the critical vulnerability of \"Shadow AI.\" When engineering teams use personal accounts or spoofed tokens to bypass enterprise controls, they risk not just technical debt but sudden, organization-wide access loss. Security directors must now audit internal toolchains to ensure that no \"dogfooding\" of competitor models violates commercial terms and that all automated workflows are authenticated via proper enterprise keys. In this new landscape, the reliability of the official API must trump the cost savings of unauthorized tools, as the operational risk of a total ban far outweighs the expense of proper integration.",

Engadget On Monday, which feels like an age ago, Jensen Huang shared the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human.

It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips. It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on right here), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing. Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

Engadget On Monday, which feels like an age ago, Jensen Huang shared the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human. When it comes to tech we all might use, we had to wait for a separate event, when NVIDIA announced DLSS 4.5 and G-Sync Pulsar. For both features, you’ll need a 50-series GPU. You got one, right?

          "standfirst": "Enterprise security teams are losing ground to AI-enabled attacks — not because defenses are weak, but because the threat model has shifted. As AI agents move into production, attackers are exploiting runtime weaknesses where breakout times are measured in seconds, patch windows in hours, and traditional security has little visibility or control.CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report documents breakout times as fast as 51 seconds. Attackers are moving from initial access to lateral movement before most security teams get their first alert. The same report found 79% of detections were malware-free, with adversaries using hands-on keyboard techniques that bypass traditional endpoint defenses entirely.CISOs’ latest challenge is not getting reverse-engineered in 72 hoursMike Riemer, field CISO at Ivanti, has watched AI collapse the window between patch release and weaponization.\"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches within 72 hours,\" Riemer told VentureBeat. \"If a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.

Why traditional security is failing at runtimeAn SQL injection typically has a recognizable signature. Security teams are improving their tradecraft, and many are blocking them with near-zero false positives.

Shadow AI isn&#x27;t a risk — it&#x27;s a certainty.\"Threat actors using AI as an attack vector has been accelerated, and they are so far in front of us as defenders,\" Riemer told VentureBeat. \"We need to get on a bandwagon as defenders to start utilizing AI; not just in deepfake detection, but in identity management. How can I use AI to determine if what&#x27;s coming at me is real?\"Carter Rees, VP of AI at Reputation, frames the technical gap: \"Defense-in-depth strategies predicated on deterministic rules and static signatures are fundamentally insufficient against the stochastic, semantic nature of attacks targeting AI models at runtime.\"11 attack vectors that bypass every traditional security controlThe OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 ranks prompt injection first. But that’s one of eleven vectors security leaders and AI builders must address. Each requires understanding both attack mechanics and defensive countermeasures.1. Direct prompt injection: Models trained to follow instructions will prioritize user commands over safety training. Pillar Security&#x27;s State of Attacks on GenAI report found 20% of jailbreaks succeed in an average of 42 seconds, with 90% of successful attacks leaking sensitive data. Defense: Intent classification that recognizes jailbreak patterns before prompts reach the model, plus output filtering that catches successful bypasses.2. Camouflage attacks: Attackers exploit the model&#x27;s tendency to follow contextual cues by embedding harmful requests inside benign conversations. Palo Alto Unit 42&#x27;s \"Deceptive Delight\" research achieved 65% success across 8,000 tests on eight different models in just three interaction turns. Defense: Context-aware analysis evaluating cumulative intent across a conversation, not individual messages.3. Multi-turn crescendo attacks: Distributing payloads across turns that each appear benign in isolation defeats single-turn protections. The automated Crescendomation tool achieved 98% success on GPT-4 and 100% on Gemini-Pro. Defense: Stateful context tracking, maintaining conversation history, and flagging escalation patterns.4. Indirect prompt injection (RAG poisoning): A zero-click exploit targeting RAG architectures, this is an attack strategy providing especially difficult to stop. PoisonedRAG research achieves 90% attack success by injecting just five malicious texts into databases containing millions of documents. Defense: Wrap retrieved data in delimiters, instructing the model to treat content as data only. Strip control tokens from vector database chunks before they enter the context window.5. Obfuscation attacks: Malicious instructions encoded using ASCII art, Base64, or Unicode bypass keyword filters while remaining interpretable to the model. ArtPrompt research achieved up to 76.2% success across GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2 in evaluating how lethal this type of attack is. Defense: Normalization layers decode all non-standard representations to plain text before semantic analysis. This single step blocks most encoding-based attacks.6. Model extraction: Systematic API queries reconstruct proprietary capabilities via distillation. Model Leeching research extracted 73% similarity from ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo for $50 in API costs over 48 hours.Defense: Behavioral fingerprinting, detecting distribution analysis patterns, watermarking proving theft post-facto, and rate limiting, analyzing query patterns beyond simple request counts.7. Resource exhaustion (sponge attacks). Crafted inputs exploit Transformer attention&#x27;s quadratic complexity, exhausting inference budgets or degrading service. IEEE EuroS&P research on sponge examples demonstrated 30× latency increases on language models. One attack pushed Microsoft Azure Translator from 1ms to 6 seconds. A 6,000× degradation. Defense: Token budgeting per user, prompt complexity analysis rejecting recursive patterns, and semantic caching serving repeated heavy prompts without incurring inference costs.8. Synthetic identity fraud. AI-generated personas combining real and fabricated data to bypass identity verification is one of retailing and financial services’ greatest AI-generated risks. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s research on synthetic identity fraud notes 85-95% of synthetic applicants evade traditional fraud models. Signicat&#x27;s 2024 report found AI-driven fraud now constitutes 42.5% of all detected fraud attempts in the financial sector. Defense: Multi-factor verification incorporating behavioral signals beyond static identity attributes, plus anomaly detection trained on synthetic identity patterns.9. Deepfake-enabled fraud. AI-generated audio and video impersonate executives to authorize transactions, often attempting to defraud organizations. Onfido&#x27;s 2024 Identity Fraud Report documented a 3,000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023. Arup lost $25 million through a single video call with AI-generated participants impersonating the CFO and colleagues. Defense: Out-of-band verification for high-value transactions, liveness detection for video authentication, and policies requiring secondary confirmation regardless of apparent seniority.10. Data exfiltration via negligent insiders. Employees paste proprietary code and strategy documents into public LLMs. That is exactly what Samsung engineers did within weeks of lifting their ChatGPT ban, leaking source code and internal meeting notes in three separate incidents. Gartner predicts 80% of unauthorized AI transactions through 2026 will stem from internal policy violations rather than malicious attacks. Defense: Personally identifiable information (PII) redaction allows safe AI tool usage while preventing sensitive data from reaching external models. Make secure usage the path of least resistance.11. Hallucination exploitation. Counterfactual prompting forces models to agree with fabrications, amplifying false outputs. Research on LLM-based agents shows that hallucinations accumulate and amplify over multi-step processes. This becomes dangerous when AI outputs feed automated workflows without human review. Defense: Grounding modules compare responses against retrieved context for faithfulness, plus confidence scoring, flagging potential hallucinations before propagation.What CISOs need to do now Gartner predicts 25% of enterprise breaches will trace to AI agent abuse by 2028. The window to build defenses is now.Chris Betz, CISO at AWS, framed it at RSA 2024: \"Companies forget about the security of the application in their rush to use generative AI.

          "standfirst": "Every third booth at CES showed off some new AI product or other. If you wanted to find a robotic lawn mower, throw a rock. Humanoid robots, smart locks and super thin TVs were everywhere. But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the multitude of problems the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s best of CES status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas. And gosh darn it, at least these guys are trying. Shine Turbine 2.0Spinning the Shine 2.0 wind turbineAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThis little guy could be a precursor to some serious personal wind power generation. That’s where the company is heading. For now, the Shine 2.0 can use as little as a light breeze to start generating power to charge your smartphones, laptops or even a power station. The whole unit weighs three pounds and sets up in around two minutes. The second generation model can output up to 75 watts and the company is working on a third version that goes up to 100 watts for even more substantial energy production. Learn more at Shine. Flint battery techFlint batteries break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a compost pile. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetWhen I approached Flint’s booth, the rep told me the company made cellulose batteries. And I thought, like paper-wrapped batteries? Nope. The chemicals inside the batteries are made from cellulose. They have a solvent-free, lithium-free, PFAS-free chemistry and break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a composting environment. They use the same basic architecture as a lithium-ion cell, with an anode, cathode and separator with ion transfers between the two. As of now, Flint is focused on partnering with manufacturers, and consumer products are on the horizon. Learn more at Flint. Clear Drop soft plastics compactorThe Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces.Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThe Clear Drop is a soft plastics compactor that creates eight by twelve by four-inch bricks out of hundreds of grocery bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks and plastic packaging. One brick is equivalent to a 30-pound trash bag-worth of bags. Once the brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities in a pre-paid USPS shipping envelope. They currently work with a few US-based recycling facilities and hope to one day create an infrastructure to include municipal recycling.Learn more at Clear Drop. Alpha Power by CPTIAlpha power by CPTIAmy Skorheim for EngadgetFrom what I’ve learned at the show, perovskite is the hottest thing in solar right now. It’s a mineral compound that’s been used to create more efficient solar panels. Some so sensitive to light that just indoor illumination is enough to create usable energy. Alpha Power by CPTI creates lightweight, flexible perovskite solar panels that can conform to multiple surfaces. Again, this is a company that’s partnering with manufacturers, so look for panels built into your laptop to charge it under the glare of your too-harsh office lights. Learn more at CPTI. Green Vigor 3D models of buildings using Green Vigor technology. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetDown in the lower levels of the Venetian Expo at CES I found Green Vigor in the Hong Kong pavilion. This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. Learn more at GreenVigor. Jackery Solar GazeboJackery's Solar Gazebo. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThis outdoor hangout spot can produce up to 10kWh of power on a given day. It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. Learn more at Jackery. Bluetti RV Solar SystemBluetti's DIY RV Solar power systemAmy Skorheim for EngadgetBluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries. This year, it brought a new power station made with bio-based plastic as well as a DIY system for adding solar power to your existing RV. Learn more at Bluetti. Airloom wind power generationAirloom's roller coaster-like wind power generator for data centers. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetEngadget’s Anna Washenko does a great job of explaining the tech behind Airloom. In short it’s a roller coaster for wind that’s comprised of 40 percent less mass than a standard wind turbine and uses 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. That makes it faster to deploy and cheaper to instal. I can also be sited in more places. Again, this is a utility-scale solution, geared towards data centers and their insatiable need for energy to power Very Important AI Things. Learn more at Airloom.Gaotu Innovation Energy GroupGaotu had a range of solar products in various formats. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetIf you are looking for a solar-powered anything, hit up Gaotu. At the company’s booth, I saw hats, a fishing chair, a backpack, a sunbrella and a car roof-top enclosure that unfurls to charge up your Tesla. The Shenzhen-based company has been in business for 18 years and plans to just keep sticking solar panels on anything it can. Learn more at Gaotu. Segway Muxi cargo e-bikeSegway's latest cargo e-bikeAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThe single largest booth in the CES sustainability section was Segway. This year, the company showed off two new e-bikes, which our own Dan Cooper covered. This one here is the Muxi, a cargo bike with an easily swappable battery, an optional passenger seat with foot pegs and an optional middle basket. Plus a beverage cup holder. Learn more at Segway. If we don’t all fall into the ocean before then, perhaps CES 2027 will have a stronger showing of sustainability tech. In the meantime, I’ll take a modicum of comfort in these few brave organizations still dedicated to keeping us afloat.

Alpha Power by CPTIAlpha power by CPTIAmy Skorheim for EngadgetFrom what I’ve learned at the show, perovskite is the hottest thing in solar right now. It’s a mineral compound that’s been used to create more efficient solar panels. Some so sensitive to light that just indoor illumination is enough to create usable energy. Alpha Power by CPTI creates lightweight, flexible perovskite solar panels that can conform to multiple surfaces. Again, this is a company that’s partnering with manufacturers, so look for panels built into your laptop to charge it under the glare of your too-harsh office lights. Learn more at CPTI. Green Vigor 3D models of buildings using Green Vigor technology. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetDown in the lower levels of the Venetian Expo at CES I found Green Vigor in the Hong Kong pavilion. This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. Learn more at GreenVigor. Jackery Solar GazeboJackery's Solar Gazebo. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThis outdoor hangout spot can produce up to 10kWh of power on a given day. It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. Learn more at Jackery. Bluetti RV Solar SystemBluetti's DIY RV Solar power systemAmy Skorheim for EngadgetBluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries. This year, it brought a new power station made with bio-based plastic as well as a DIY system for adding solar power to your existing RV. Learn more at Bluetti. Airloom wind power generationAirloom's roller coaster-like wind power generator for data centers. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetEngadget’s Anna Washenko does a great job of explaining the tech behind Airloom. In short it’s a roller coaster for wind that’s comprised of 40 percent less mass than a standard wind turbine and uses 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. That makes it faster to deploy and cheaper to instal. I can also be sited in more places. Again, this is a utility-scale solution, geared towards data centers and their insatiable need for energy to power Very Important AI Things. Learn more at Airloom.Gaotu Innovation Energy GroupGaotu had a range of solar products in various formats. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetIf you are looking for a solar-powered anything, hit up Gaotu. At the company’s booth, I saw hats, a fishing chair, a backpack, a sunbrella and a car roof-top enclosure that unfurls to charge up your Tesla. The Shenzhen-based company has been in business for 18 years and plans to just keep sticking solar panels on anything it can. Learn more at Gaotu. Segway Muxi cargo e-bikeSegway's latest cargo e-bikeAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThe single largest booth in the CES sustainability section was Segway. This year, the company showed off two new e-bikes, which our own Dan Cooper covered. This one here is the Muxi, a cargo bike with an easily swappable battery, an optional passenger seat with foot pegs and an optional middle basket. Plus a beverage cup holder. Learn more at Segway. If we don’t all fall into the ocean before then, perhaps CES 2027 will have a stronger showing of sustainability tech. In the meantime, I’ll take a modicum of comfort in these few brave organizations still dedicated to keeping us afloat.

          "standfirst": "Dell's XPS 14 now costs over $2,000. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung's marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, told Bloomberg at CES: \"There's going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it's going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.\"Dell's new XPS 14 and XPS 16 are among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year's models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. But Dell later announced a shocking price jump: The XPS 14 now starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. While it didn't take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000, it's genuinely wild to me that the entry-level models are already starting there. And meanwhile, Apple still hasn't budged its $1,599 MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.On the desktop front, AMD's David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company's AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.\"I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,\" he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. \"Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there's a pretty big boost there.\"McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD's business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.\"There's no product that has memory in it that's immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it's doing to the market,\" he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. \"I think the, the truth is the volatility that we've seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.\" Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn't discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD's X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don't see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its new Helios AI rack, which supports up to 31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.

          "standfirst": "Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that feels charmingly out-of-place in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab. That was obviously two years ago when the company first revealed its keyboard case that brought tactile typing to the iPhone and eventually other Android devices. Rather than that being a one-off curiosity, the company had two new announcements at CES 2026: a magnetic keyboard accessory that also doubles as a battery bank and small, squat mobile phone with a keyboard. And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetThe Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetAs someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. “You've got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you've got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there's a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You've got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you've got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetThe other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn't your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of the Niagara Android launcher, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we've optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it's not the thing you're going to reach for to do that. But we're not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience.

          "standfirst": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is upon us. All manner of companies descended on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew were on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we kept tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, LG showed off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There was some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some weird tech.You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either. Some are available to buy right now. You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We also had CES live updates with all the latest news from the event. Be sure to check out Engadget’s best of CES 2026 as well, in which we highlighted 15 winners across several categories, and named our best in show honoree.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and the imperial march.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGAlong with some TVs (which we’ll get to momentarily), LG brought plenty of other products to CES. For one thing, the company shone a spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon. During an in-person CES demo, Engadget senior reporter Karissa Bell saw CLOiD competently pull off some household tasks, albeit very slowly.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was largely a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some fresh news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios (self-driving car tech, in other words). The company also revealed that a supercomputer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture which it first unveiled in 2024 is now in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel in recent times, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it steady the ship. These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says these chips offer improvements to performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased an Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. This isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the previous iteration.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for more detailed specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint with the ROG Zephyrus Duo. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Lenovo, meanwhile, showed off a concept laptop with an expandable, rollable screen. You really need to see this thing in action.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetAs ever, TVs were front and center at CES. Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We saw more of these TVs at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that arena with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the latest Fire TV OS will be up to 30 percent faster. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates. Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too. Belkin, meanwhile, has a new wireless HDMI dongle that doesn't require a Wi-Fi connection. That should make it easy to beam videos from a device with a USB-C port to a TV, monitor or projector — handy if you’re planning an outdoor movie night in a space with spotty internet access.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first such model on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature, in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and have a dedicated section of the display for each. That could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that setup. You can control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors just ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES, though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over the previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for summer camping trips, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the lead up to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those as well). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. The First Look event has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to help you do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's at the prototype stage and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It has sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the bulkiness and the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea). However, after Sam opened up the Galaxy Z TriFold, his “concerns were quickly pushed aside” by “10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate may come in handy for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on story for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll learn the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then there’s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there was a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere were a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic ($399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle appSubtleAs for Subtle’s Voicebuds, those are said to be capable of picking up audio below the sound of a whisper, so you can very quietly dictate information to them and an AI model will transcribe what you can say. You can use the $199 voicebuds as regular earbuds too for making calls and listening to audio. However, you’ll need to fork over $17 a month for access to features like instant dictation and the option to transcribe notes without having to look at your phone (internet access is required to use Subtle’s best transcription models too). If you opt not to subscribe, the Voicebuds will use a smaller local model for transcription.On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that can draft an email when you mention that you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.Switchbot's Onero H1.Karissa Bell for EngadgetLG’s CLOiD is still a concept helper robot for now, but the Onero H1 is one you may be able to buy as soon as this year. During an in-person demo, we saw Switchbot’s Onero H1 robot (slowly) pick up clothes, chuck them in a washing machine and close the door. The company has also released a video that shows the Onero H1 carrying out other household tasks, from serving food and drinks to washing windows. We’re told Switchbot plans to sell the robot for \"less than $10,000.\"Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.Then there’s OlloBot, a companion robot with an optional extendable, fuzzy neck that’s warm to the touch. OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break. The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too. The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit. Adorable!TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony Honda Mobility plans to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona. However, after getting a close-up look at the latest iteration of the EV, Engadget contributor Tim Stevens reckons the Afeela 1 feels “more and more out of touch” with each passing year, even though it “was an audacious product when it was announced at CES 2020.”We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.Longbow Motors SpeedsterTim Stevens for EngadgetLongbow Motors announced a pair of lightweight EVs that have a curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. The Speedster and Roadster boast advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs, a Verge Motorcycles spinoff. Longbow brought the Speedster to CES and the EV looks quite fetching. The vehicles will be pricey, though. Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, and that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi looks quite pretty and it has a cup holder (love that), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year, even though I don’t think I’d actually use it very much. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. There are also several emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. As noted in our live blog, Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith had a chance to try out the FlipPad. We also saw a new Xbox controller from 8BitDo that has swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller — partly because I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk. So, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. The side panel can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio. There’s also an AI desktop companion device with several avatars to choose from, including an anime girl and legendary League of Legends player Faker.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while (largely due to the Sonos integration), and the Soundstage speaker — available this summer for $350 — is tempting too. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer but there’s no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model as well as on the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victrola and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds — which have Dolby Atmos support — and Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the outside of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now. Still, the audio quality is “excellent,” as Billy wrote in his hands-on story. Smart homeDreame Cyber X robot vacuumEngadgetAs ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a robot vacuum concept from Dreame. It's one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.Narwhal built a new vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a \"PetCare Mode\" you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you're not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both of these products should be available in the spring.Anker's Eufy brand has a new robot vacuum too, along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. This one’s pretty interesting: Lockin’s latest vein-recognition smart lock can wirelessly recharge via an optical infrared beam emitted by a separate device that’s plugged into an outlet.On a similar note, Ring has updated its door, window and break glass sensors, and it has introduced an OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. Most of those will be available in March, though you can pre-order the car alarm now.Elsewhere in home security, Ugreen announced a modular system that, refreshingly, does not require a subscription. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim checked out the products and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA's lamps and other devices.Amy also went hands-on (well, voice-on) with some pretty interesting devices from Emerson Smart. The company’s on-device voice command tech means that you can control its smart plugs, fans, heaters and air fryers without a Wi-Fi connection or having to set things up through an app.Philips Hue SpatialAware featureSpeaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES. You'll need a Hue Bridge Pro to use the SpatialAware feature, which uses augmented reality to make sure all of the lights in a room are working together harmoniously to create, for instance, a more natural-looking sunset scene. Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring. Also on the way is Apple Home support for the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors.Elsewhere in lighting, Govee has a new floor lamp, as well as a ceiling light that's said to simulate a skylight.GE Profile Smart Fridge on display at CES Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn terms of kitchen tech, GE Appliances has a new smart refrigerator that's designed to make restocking easier. It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It's possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There's also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge's crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899. Check out Amy’s hands-on story for our initial impressions.NoshDaniel Cooper for EngadgetNosh, meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you'll be able to buy in the next few months. Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh's repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you'll still need to prep fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you're ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the T1 leaf blower (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September. Meanwhile, Segway’s Navimow unit has a bunch of new robot mowers. Health and accessibilityImage of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that a toilet computer made an appearance in our roundup of weird CES tech. But if I’ve learned anything from watching Scrubs, it’s that our waste offers up a lot of revealing information about our health, so Throne is a pretty compelling device. It has a camera and microphone to track your bowel movements and urination levels. The idea is to figure out your regular toilet usage and then flag any deviations from that. The creators hope that Throne will help you gain a better understanding of your gut health, which could be beneficial for those on GLP-1 drugs or who have gastrointestinal conditions. Throne will start shipping in February for $340 and a $6 per month subscription.Image of Vivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo also showed off a toilet device that can monitor your urination levels. Not only that, the company unveiled a smart menstrual pad. The idea is for for wearers to scan the pad with their phone camera after use.Elsewhere, the latest version of Withing’s Body Scan scale can track 60 biomarkers, up from the 40 the first model;s 40. The Body Scan 2 should be available in the spring for $600.Image of the Eyebot KioskDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOne other health-focused product we found interesting was the Eyebot vision test booth. This kiosk aims to speed up the eye exam process with a test that takes just a couple of minutes. A licensed eye doctor who works remotely will take a look at Eyebot’s findings before signing off on a prescription. The kiosk can’t run medical tests, such as the brief blast of air that eye doctors use to assess the risk of glaucoma. But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the groundCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAccessibility tech is a welcome presence at CES, and WheelMove looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users. It’s a device with a large front wheel that can quickly be attached to any manual wheelchair. It can then raise the wheelchair’s smaller front wheels off the ground, primarily to help users navigate rough terrain. The $6,000 WheelMove will debut in France later their year before a broader rollout.ReviMo has built a robotic lift that it says can help people move themselves from (for instance) a bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a caregiver. The company expects Niko to cost around $15,000, but it’s attempting to get the device covered by insurance.Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as \"bionic footwear.\"Karissa Bell for EngadgetDephy’s Sidekick is designed as a walking aid. It’s an ankle-worn exoskeleton that hooks into a sneaker. The Sidekick has sensors that can detect the user’s gait and adapt to it in order to deliver an effective boost in each step. At $4,500, the Sidekick isn’t cheap, but it could be a boon for those who are perhaps not as physically active as they’d like to be. Dephy is also adapting the tech for athletic use — the company is working with Nike on a robotic sneaker project.WearablesPebble Round 2Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs ever, there were lots of wearables at CES. Pebble successor Core Devices was there with a followup to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted just over a decade ago. The circular ​​Pebble Round 2 has a far thinner bezel than its predecessor, a 1.3-inch color e-paper display and a promised battery life of over two weeks. The latest model from the revived smartwatch brand is coming your way in May for $199, and we've had a chance to try it out.Three Pebble Indexes side by side on a table.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThere's also a Pebble smart ring called the Index 01. It has a button that you can press to talk to Pebble's Claude-powered AI when there's something you want to remember. Engadget managing editor Cherlynn Low had a chance to pop one on at CES, and reckoned that Pebble and Core Devices founder Eric Migicovsky and his team might \"have the right approach to making an AI ring.\"You can pre-order the Index 01 now for $75. Once it starts shipping in March, the price will jump up to $99.Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThere was some intriguing news on the wristband front, particularly in terms of the Meta ecosystem. The company demoed a way to use its EMG wristband (which comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses) to control other devices, such as a car's infotainment system.On top of that, a startup called Hapware has made a haptic wristband that works with the computer vision functions of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. It's said to be capable of understanding the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of people you're chatting with, which could be beneficial for folks who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent. The Alaye wristband starts at $359. You can pay $637 for a version that includes a one-year subscription. Otherwise, Hapware's required plan costs $29 per month.Smart glasses were present at CES as well. Xreal gave its entry-level One cinema glasses a spec bump and a new name. The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99. Like the Xreal 1S, it’s available now.The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetASUS and Xreal teamed up to make the gaming-focused ROG Xreal R1 smart glasses. They have 1080p displays with a 240Hz refresh rate. An included control dock has two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4 port, making it a cinch to hook up and switch between console, handhelds and PC inputs. ASUS and Xreal have yet to announce a release date or pricing.Projector maker XGIMI also debuted its first smart glasses at CES, while Lumus demoed models with 30-degree and 70-degree fields of view. IXI had something compelling to show off too: a pair of glasses that can automatically focus on what you're looking at. The company is hoping to release a consumer version this year, Other things that caught our eyeThis roundup is pretty darn exhaustive (if I do say so myself), but there's still so much more that grabbed our attention at CES. Much of that tech perhaps doesn't quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let's jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:HP revived an old trend by stuffing a computer inside a keyboard.We've long liked Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand's first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.Yukai Engineering's Baby FuFu is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.Anker's Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The Bottle Washer S1 also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.Clear Drop can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don't accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It's a compelling idea, even if the company's device costs $1,400.It's always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. Birdbuddy showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026. Thanks for sticking with us this week!This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/all-the-tech-and-gadgets-announced-at-ces-2026-130124023.html?src=rss",
          "content": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is upon us. All manner of companies descended on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew were on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we kept tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, LG showed off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There was some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some weird tech.You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either. Some are available to buy right now. You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We also had CES live updates with all the latest news from the event. Be sure to check out Engadget’s best of CES 2026 as well, in which we highlighted 15 winners across several categories, and named our best in show honoree.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and the imperial march.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGAlong with some TVs (which we’ll get to momentarily), LG brought plenty of other products to CES. For one thing, the company shone a spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon. During an in-person CES demo, Engadget senior reporter Karissa Bell saw CLOiD competently pull off some household tasks, albeit very slowly.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was largely a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some fresh news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios (self-driving car tech, in other words). The company also revealed that a supercomputer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture which it first unveiled in 2024 is now in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel in recent times, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it steady the ship. These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says these chips offer improvements to performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased an Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. This isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the previous iteration.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for more detailed specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint with the ROG Zephyrus Duo. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Lenovo, meanwhile, showed off a concept laptop with an expandable, rollable screen. You really need to see this thing in action.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetAs ever, TVs were front and center at CES. Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We saw more of these TVs at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that arena with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the latest Fire TV OS will be up to 30 percent faster. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates. Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too. Belkin, meanwhile, has a new wireless HDMI dongle that doesn't require a Wi-Fi connection. That should make it easy to beam videos from a device with a USB-C port to a TV, monitor or projector — handy if you’re planning an outdoor movie night in a space with spotty internet access.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first such model on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature, in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and have a dedicated section of the display for each. That could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that setup. You can control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors just ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES, though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over the previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for summer camping trips, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the lead up to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those as well). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. The First Look event has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to help you do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's at the prototype stage and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It has sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the bulkiness and the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea). However, after Sam opened up the Galaxy Z TriFold, his “concerns were quickly pushed aside” by “10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate may come in handy for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on story for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll learn the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then there’s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there was a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere were a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic ($399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle appSubtleAs for Subtle’s Voicebuds, those are said to be capable of picking up audio below the sound of a whisper, so you can very quietly dictate information to them and an AI model will transcribe what you can say. You can use the $199 voicebuds as regular earbuds too for making calls and listening to audio. However, you’ll need to fork over $17 a month for access to features like instant dictation and the option to transcribe notes without having to look at your phone (internet access is required to use Subtle’s best transcription models too). If you opt not to subscribe, the Voicebuds will use a smaller local model for transcription.On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that can draft an email when you mention that you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.Switchbot's Onero H1.Karissa Bell for EngadgetLG’s CLOiD is still a concept helper robot for now, but the Onero H1 is one you may be able to buy as soon as this year. During an in-person demo, we saw Switchbot’s Onero H1 robot (slowly) pick up clothes, chuck them in a washing machine and close the door. The company has also released a video that shows the Onero H1 carrying out other household tasks, from serving food and drinks to washing windows. We’re told Switchbot plans to sell the robot for \"less than $10,000.\"Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.Then there’s OlloBot, a companion robot with an optional extendable, fuzzy neck that’s warm to the touch. OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break. The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too. The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit. Adorable!TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony Honda Mobility plans to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona. However, after getting a close-up look at the latest iteration of the EV, Engadget contributor Tim Stevens reckons the Afeela 1 feels “more and more out of touch” with each passing year, even though it “was an audacious product when it was announced at CES 2020.”We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.Longbow Motors SpeedsterTim Stevens for EngadgetLongbow Motors announced a pair of lightweight EVs that have a curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. The Speedster and Roadster boast advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs, a Verge Motorcycles spinoff. Longbow brought the Speedster to CES and the EV looks quite fetching. The vehicles will be pricey, though. Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, and that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi looks quite pretty and it has a cup holder (love that), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year, even though I don’t think I’d actually use it very much. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. There are also several emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. As noted in our live blog, Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith had a chance to try out the FlipPad. We also saw a new Xbox controller from 8BitDo that has swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller — partly because I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk. So, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. The side panel can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio. There’s also an AI desktop companion device with several avatars to choose from, including an anime girl and legendary League of Legends player Faker.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while (largely due to the Sonos integration), and the Soundstage speaker — available this summer for $350 — is tempting too. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer but there’s no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model as well as on the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victrola and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds — which have Dolby Atmos support — and Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the outside of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now. Still, the audio quality is “excellent,” as Billy wrote in his hands-on story. Smart homeDreame Cyber X robot vacuumEngadgetAs ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a robot vacuum concept from Dreame. It's one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.Narwhal built a new vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a \"PetCare Mode\" you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you're not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both of these products should be available in the spring.Anker's Eufy brand has a new robot vacuum too, along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. This one’s pretty interesting: Lockin’s latest vein-recognition smart lock can wirelessly recharge via an optical infrared beam emitted by a separate device that’s plugged into an outlet.On a similar note, Ring has updated its door, window and break glass sensors, and it has introduced an OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. Most of those will be available in March, though you can pre-order the car alarm now.Elsewhere in home security, Ugreen announced a modular system that, refreshingly, does not require a subscription. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim checked out the products and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA's lamps and other devices.Amy also went hands-on (well, voice-on) with some pretty interesting devices from Emerson Smart. The company’s on-device voice command tech means that you can control its smart plugs, fans, heaters and air fryers without a Wi-Fi connection or having to set things up through an app.Philips Hue SpatialAware featureSpeaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES. You'll need a Hue Bridge Pro to use the SpatialAware feature, which uses augmented reality to make sure all of the lights in a room are working together harmoniously to create, for instance, a more natural-looking sunset scene. Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring. Also on the way is Apple Home support for the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors.Elsewhere in lighting, Govee has a new floor lamp, as well as a ceiling light that's said to simulate a skylight.GE Profile Smart Fridge on display at CES Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn terms of kitchen tech, GE Appliances has a new smart refrigerator that's designed to make restocking easier. It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It's possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There's also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge's crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899. Check out Amy’s hands-on story for our initial impressions.NoshDaniel Cooper for EngadgetNosh, meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you'll be able to buy in the next few months. Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh's repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you'll still need to prep fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you're ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the T1 leaf blower (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September. Meanwhile, Segway’s Navimow unit has a bunch of new robot mowers. Health and accessibilityImage of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that a toilet computer made an appearance in our roundup of weird CES tech. But if I’ve learned anything from watching Scrubs, it’s that our waste offers up a lot of revealing information about our health, so Throne is a pretty compelling device. It has a camera and microphone to track your bowel movements and urination levels. The idea is to figure out your regular toilet usage and then flag any deviations from that. The creators hope that Throne will help you gain a better understanding of your gut health, which could be beneficial for those on GLP-1 drugs or who have gastrointestinal conditions. Throne will start shipping in February for $340 and a $6 per month subscription.Image of Vivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo also showed off a toilet device that can monitor your urination levels. Not only that, the company unveiled a smart menstrual pad. The idea is for for wearers to scan the pad with their phone camera after use.Elsewhere, the latest version of Withing’s Body Scan scale can track 60 biomarkers, up from the 40 the first model;s 40. The Body Scan 2 should be available in the spring for $600.Image of the Eyebot KioskDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOne other health-focused product we found interesting was the Eyebot vision test booth. This kiosk aims to speed up the eye exam process with a test that takes just a couple of minutes. A licensed eye doctor who works remotely will take a look at Eyebot’s findings before signing off on a prescription. The kiosk can’t run medical tests, such as the brief blast of air that eye doctors use to assess the risk of glaucoma. But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the groundCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAccessibility tech is a welcome presence at CES, and WheelMove looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users. It’s a device with a large front wheel that can quickly be attached to any manual wheelchair. It can then raise the wheelchair’s smaller front wheels off the ground, primarily to help users navigate rough terrain. The $6,000 WheelMove will debut in France later their year before a broader rollout.ReviMo has built a robotic lift that it says can help people move themselves from (for instance) a bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a caregiver. The company expects Niko to cost around $15,000, but it’s attempting to get the device covered by insurance.Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as \"bionic footwear.\"Karissa Bell for EngadgetDephy’s Sidekick is designed as a walking aid. It’s an ankle-worn exoskeleton that hooks into a sneaker. The Sidekick has sensors that can detect the user’s gait and adapt to it in order to deliver an effective boost in each step. At $4,500, the Sidekick isn’t cheap, but it could be a boon for those who are perhaps not as physically active as they’d like to be. Dephy is also adapting the tech for athletic use — the company is working with Nike on a robotic sneaker project.WearablesPebble Round 2Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs ever, there were lots of wearables at CES. Pebble successor Core Devices was there with a followup to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted just over a decade ago. The circular ​​Pebble Round 2 has a far thinner bezel than its predecessor, a 1.3-inch color e-paper display and a promised battery life of over two weeks. The latest model from the revived smartwatch brand is coming your way in May for $199, and we've had a chance to try it out.Three Pebble Indexes side by side on a table.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThere's also a Pebble smart ring called the Index 01. It has a button that you can press to talk to Pebble's Claude-powered AI when there's something you want to remember. Engadget managing editor Cherlynn Low had a chance to pop one on at CES, and reckoned that Pebble and Core Devices founder Eric Migicovsky and his team might \"have the right approach to making an AI ring.\"You can pre-order the Index 01 now for $75. Once it starts shipping in March, the price will jump up to $99.Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThere was some intriguing news on the wristband front, particularly in terms of the Meta ecosystem. The company demoed a way to use its EMG wristband (which comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses) to control other devices, such as a car's infotainment system.On top of that, a startup called Hapware has made a haptic wristband that works with the computer vision functions of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. It's said to be capable of understanding the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of people you're chatting with, which could be beneficial for folks who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent. The Alaye wristband starts at $359. You can pay $637 for a version that includes a one-year subscription. Otherwise, Hapware's required plan costs $29 per month.Smart glasses were present at CES as well. Xreal gave its entry-level One cinema glasses a spec bump and a new name. The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99. Like the Xreal 1S, it’s available now.The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetASUS and Xreal teamed up to make the gaming-focused ROG Xreal R1 smart glasses. They have 1080p displays with a 240Hz refresh rate. An included control dock has two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4 port, making it a cinch to hook up and switch between console, handhelds and PC inputs. ASUS and Xreal have yet to announce a release date or pricing.Projector maker XGIMI also debuted its first smart glasses at CES, while Lumus demoed models with 30-degree and 70-degree fields of view. IXI had something compelling to show off too: a pair of glasses that can automatically focus on what you're looking at. The company is hoping to release a consumer version this year, Other things that caught our eyeThis roundup is pretty darn exhaustive (if I do say so myself), but there's still so much more that grabbed our attention at CES. Much of that tech perhaps doesn't quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let's jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:HP revived an old trend by stuffing a computer inside a keyboard.We've long liked Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand's first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.Yukai Engineering's Baby FuFu is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.Anker's Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The Bottle Washer S1 also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.Clear Drop can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don't accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It's a compelling idea, even if the company's device costs $1,400.It's always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. Birdbuddy showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026.

          "standfirst": "LG opened CES 2026 by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a robot will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.There’s obvious reasons for this: AI swallowed the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of Panther Lake is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away from EVs and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on production lines, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch. At least, I hope they were pretending.I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I've got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many toilet computers, massage chairs and scootcases we all need in our daily lives. There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. Holographic AI waifus that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of AI Labubus operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a tablet on a moveable base that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens. I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES is a launchpad for serious tech, but it’s also where companies proudly unveil devices that make you stop mid-scroll and whisper, “Wait, this is real?” We’ve been keeping a running list of the strangest, funniest and most unexpectedly compelling gadgets we’ve spotted in Las Vegas, from bathroom computers to robots that look like they escaped a Pixar pitch meeting. Also, be sure to check out our list of the best CES tech we saw this year at the show.Dreame Cyber X robot vacuumDreame Cyber XEngadgetRobot vacuums can be a little unsettling already, but Dreame’s Cyber X takes it up a level by sprouting chunky treaded “legs” and hauling itself up a full staircase like a tiny cleaning tank. In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.OlloBotTwo OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.CES loves a companion robot, but OlloBot might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoOn top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect. The Zephyrus Duo uses a detachable keyboard and a built-in kickstand so you can stack screens, spread out, or generally arrange your portable battle station however you like. It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.Throne toilet computerThe Throne device perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThrone is a toilet-mounted computer that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual padVivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized. Alongside its clip-on smart toilet that analyzes your hydration by literally monitoring your pee, the company also unveiled a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics that can track fertility and hormone markers once you scan it with your phone. It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.Lenovo Legion Pro RollableWhile it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.Lenovo ThinkBook XD RollableWith its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6's basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIf the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the ThinkBook XD Rollable is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.OhDoki Handy 2 ProImage of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 ProDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.iPolishiPolishDaniel Cooper for EngadgetiPolish finally made Total Recall nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.Hisense S6 FollowMe displayHisense S6 FollowMe displayHisenseDespite the name, Hisense’s FollowMe doesn’t actually follow you at all. It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.GE Profile Smart FridgeFinally! A reasonably sized fridge screen.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIf you’ve ever bought a “just in case” bag of spinach and discovered three more at home, GE’s latest smart fridge wants to be your grocery reality check. A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.L’Oréal LED eye maskA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L’Oréal’s beauty tech lineup includes an LED eye mask that looks delightfully ridiculous in the best way: ultra-thin, semi-transparent silicone with visible microcircuitry that makes it feel like sci-fi skincare. The company says it precisely controls red and near-infrared wavelengths in 10-minute sessions, and it’s working on a companion serum so your skin doesn’t feel like it’s been left out to dry.

          "title": "Dolby Vision 2 is coming this year, here’s what you need to know",
          "standfirst": "Dolby may have announced Dolby Vision 2 a few months ago, but the company gave the new platform its first big reveal at CES 2026. I got the chance to see the improvements in person for the first time, thanks to a variety of demos and Q&A sessions. Dolby Vision 2 will be available this year, but initially, it will be limited. As such, I’ve compiled the info on where the image engine will be available first, and what’s likely to come next in terms of where and how you can use it. But first, let’s quickly summarize what Dolby Vision 2 will even do for your TV. What is Dolby Vision 2?Dolby Vision 2 is Dolby’s next-generation image engine that the company announced in September. The new standard will do several things to improve picture quality on your TV, including content recognition that optimizes your TV based on what and where you’re watching. This first element will improve scenes that many viewers complain are too dark, compensate for ambient lighting and apply motion adjustments for live sports and gaming. Dolby Vision 2 will also deliver new tone mapping for improved color reproduction. I witnessed this first hand in various demos at CES, and this is the biggest difference between the current Dolby Vision and DV2 for me. There’s also a new Authentic Motion feature that will provide the optimal amount of smoothing so that content appears more “authentically cinematic,” according to Dolby. This means getting rid of unwanted judder, but stopping short of the so-called soap opera effect. Essentially, Dolby is taking advantage of all of the capabilities of today’s TVs, harnessing the improvements to display quality and processing power that companies have developed in the decade since Dolby Vision first arrived.What TVs will support Dolby Vision 2?Lifestyle photo of the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED SeriesTCLThe biggest Dolby Vision 2 news at CES was the first three TV makers that have pledged support for the new standard. Hisense is bringing it to its 2026 RGB MiniLED TVs — including UX, UR9 and UR8. The company also plans to add it to more MiniLED TVs with an OTA update. TCL's 2026 X QD-Mini LED TV Series and C Series will support Dolby Vision 2 via a future update. It will be available on TP Vision’s Philips’ 2026 OLED TVs, including the 2026 Philips OLED811, and OLED911 series as well as the flagship OLED951.There are sure to be other companies that announce Dolby Vision 2 support in 2026. Sony doesn’t announce its new TVs at CES anymore, so that’s just one of the bigger names that’s yet to reveal its hand. Any upcoming TVs that seek to leverage the full suite of tools that Dolby Vision 2 offers will need to have an ambient light sensor as that’s one of the key facets of Dolby’s upgrade. What content will be available in Dolby Vision 2?Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings.PeacockThe other big piece of Dolby Vision 2 news at CES 2026 was the first streaming service that will support the platform. Peacock grabbed that honor, and so far it’s the only streamer to pledge support. However, several services support the current version of Dolby Vision, including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and Paramount+. Like the additional TV support that’s sure to be announced throughout the year, I expect more streaming services will jump on board soon as well.

Hisense is bringing it to its 2026 RGB MiniLED TVs — including UX, UR9 and UR8. The company also plans to add it to more MiniLED TVs with an OTA update. TCL's 2026 X QD-Mini LED TV Series and C Series will support Dolby Vision 2 via a future update. It will be available on TP Vision’s Philips’ 2026 OLED TVs, including the 2026 Philips OLED811, and OLED911 series as well as the flagship OLED951.There are sure to be other companies that announce Dolby Vision 2 support in 2026. Sony doesn’t announce its new TVs at CES anymore, so that’s just one of the bigger names that’s yet to reveal its hand. Any upcoming TVs that seek to leverage the full suite of tools that Dolby Vision 2 offers will need to have an ambient light sensor as that’s one of the key facets of Dolby’s upgrade. What content will be available in Dolby Vision 2?Peacock is bringing Dolby Vision and Atmos support to more live sports offerings.PeacockThe other big piece of Dolby Vision 2 news at CES 2026 was the first streaming service that will support the platform. Peacock grabbed that honor, and so far it’s the only streamer to pledge support. However, several services support the current version of Dolby Vision, including Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and Paramount+. Like the additional TV support that’s sure to be announced throughout the year, I expect more streaming services will jump on board soon as well.

          "standfirst": "Probably my favorite thing about the Lego Smart Play system unveiled this week at CES is that it was designed for kids, first and foremost. In the past 10 years or so, Lego has increasingly courted an older audience with more expensive and elaborate sets. But when it was time to bring more advanced technology to Lego, the idea right from the beginning was more social and interactive play. If you haven’t heard about Smart Play yet, its a way for Lego to make its sets more interactive. A Smart Brick filled with sensors makes it so sets can respond to each other, know when they’re moving, play sounds and know when the corresponding Smart Minifigures are near them. Tiny Smart Tags, meanwhile, help the Smart Brick know the context of how it’s being used — whether it’s in a helicopter, car or duck for example. Tom Donaldson, senior VP and Head of Creative Play Lab at the LEGO Group, told Engadget that the company worked on Smart Play for about eight years before introducing it this week, and that social play was the starting point. “We started really looking at consumer needs, and this idea that kids really like social play,” said Donaldson “Kids really like the sort of things that change when they come back to them, and the kids really like agency. They want to be able to change things.” Lego's Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES.LEGOBut a big part of the creation process was making the Smart Brick as flexible and powerful as possible and then seeing what scenarios could take advantage of it. “We wanted to build a really powerful platform,” he said. “What we shouldn't do is say, ‘this is what we think we're gonna need.’ We needed to say, ‘let's create something that has a lot of capabilities that we can then figure out how to use.’”One of the conflicts with the tech-packed Smart Play system, though, might be the cost. Obviously, Lego has been successful at most ventures it has undertaken in recent years, but the pricing of Smart Play sets could make adoption a bit challenging. The biggest Smart Play set, Star Wars Throne Room Duel & A-Wing, for example, has almost 1,000 pieces and costs $160. That’s quite a bit more than comparably sized sets. The dual factors of the Star Wars license and Smart Play tech certainly impacted the cost. Lego Smart Play Star Wars setLEGOThe set includes two Smart Bricks, five Smart Tags and three Smart Minifigures, the most “smart” gear included in any of the initial three Star Wars Smart Play sets. Will parents shell out for the more advanced capabilities that Smart Play offers, or will they stick with standard sets? For now, Lego is betting the extremely broad appeal of Star Wars will help these new Smart Play sets find an audience. About three years ago, Lego got its team focused on the Star Wars franchise involved, as well as Lucasfilm, to figure out how to roll Smart Play out to the world. “Very early on, we all decided that starting with the original trilogy would be great,” said Derek Stothard, Disney’s Director of Global Licensing “These are such well-known scenes and characters, and they cross generations, so parents can introduce them to their kids. All that works really well together.” Unsurprisingly, Lego is being coy about where things go beyond the initial three Star Wars sets, but it’s clear that after eight years of development, they’ll want to bring it to as many product lines as possible. “We're announcing a platform that you can see has tremendous growth [potential], Donaldson said. “We made the analogy with the minifigure as something that you’ll see across the entire [Lego] system, maybe not in every single SKU but it’ll reappear in many different places. But ultimately we're a company that really focuses on giving kids what they want, what they love, and we'll have to see how it lives in a market.”That last point about how it lives in the market is a good one, particularly given the pricing. We probably won’t know for sure until Lego moves beyond the safe confines of Star Wars and really shows us what Smart Play can do across more varied scenarios. And going to non-licensed sets might be where Smart Play really takes off — it’s easy to imagine a cheaper Smart Play add-on kit that can bring sets to life at a lower cost. But the idea of transforming anything kids create into something more interactive has a ton of potential if Lego can broaden its appeal beyond Star Wars fans.

          "title": "The 7 best cordless vacuums for 2026",
          "standfirst": "Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you. Table of contents Best cordless vacuums for 2026 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum How we test cordless vacuums Cordless stick vacuums FAQs Best cordless vacuums for 2026 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Dyson Gen 5 Detect The Dyson Gen 5 Detect has a single-button start and stronger suction power than our top pick, but it’s otherwise quite similar. However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year. Levoit Aero The biggest selling point of the Levoit Aero is the attached bin into which the vacuum will empty its dustbin when you press a button once it's docked after a cleaning. I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the \"self\" part isn't really there — instead, there's a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It's convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well. LG CordZero Q3 The $329 CordZero Q3 is a perfectly capable vacuum with a single-button start, two manual power modes, adjustable suction technology that detects carpets and hard flooring and a cleaner head outfitted with LEDs to help you better spot all the dirt on your floors. But it's ultimately just fine in comparison to our top picks; it's not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it's just awkward) and it doesn't have the smoothest handling. Shark Detect Pro The Shark Detect Pro provides a lot of value for the money, but it was ultimately beat by the Tineco Pure One Station 5 for our runner-up slot thanks to the Tineco’s stronger suction power. The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture. Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum Design and bin capacity Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices. Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners. Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session. If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum. Suction and power modes Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power. Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength. Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible. If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs. Floor type The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it's still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet. Battery life Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy. Base style Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby. Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris. “Smart” features Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area. Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the best robot vacuums, or even the best budget robot vacuums, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t need Wi-Fi or an app connectivity. Price Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more. How we test cordless vacuums Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot. Cordless stick vacuums FAQs How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum? Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster. Can cordless vacuums be as powerful as corded ones? Cordless vacuums do sacrifice a bit in overall power when compared to corded models, but that doesn’t mean they can’t handle everyday messes just as well. If suction power is your biggest concern, we recommend springing for a high-powered, high-end cordless vacuum since, typically, the more expensive a cordless vacuum is, the stronger the suction. Also, cordless vacuums have the edge over corded models when it comes to weight and convenience: cordless vacuums are much lighter than their corded counterparts, and you’ll never have to worry about placement or picking a fight with a cord while cleaning your living room. Are cordless vacuums effective on pet hair? Yes, cordless vacuums can handle pet hair well, but we recommend getting a model with strong suction power to get the best results. It’s also wise to get one with a larger bin, since pet hair can quickly fill up smaller bins, which may force you to stop cleaning to empty the vacuum before finishing. What are the best methods for maintaining a cordless vacuum cleaner? Maintaining a cordless vacuum is super easy and helps to keep it running like new. First, make sure to empty the dustbin regularly — don’t let it overfill, as this can impact suction. Many models have washable filters, so rinse them out every few weeks (check your manual for specifics) and let them dry completely before putting them back. Next, take a look at the brush roll — hair and debris can get tangled up in there over time. Most vacuums make it simple to remove the brush roll, so you can snip away any tangles with scissors. If your vacuum has a replaceable battery, try not to let it fully drain too often, as this can reduce its lifespan. A quick wipe-down of the vacuum’s exterior and attachments will also keep everything looking fresh. Lastly, keep an eye on the sensors and charging contacts, as dust can build up there too. A gentle wipe with a dry cloth every now and then will do the trick. Can cordless vacuums also be used to clean curtains and upholstery? Cordless vacuums are surprisingly versatile, and many come with attachments specifically designed for surfaces like curtains, upholstery and even mattresses. A handheld vacuum mode, which is common in cordless models, makes it easy to tackle these areas. Look for a soft brush or an upholstery tool in the attachments for the vacuum you’re considering — it’ll help remove dust and pet hair without damaging fabrics. For curtains, it’s a good idea to use a lower suction setting if your vacuum has adjustable modes. This prevents the fabric from getting pulled into the nozzle.

          "content": "Old-school, upright vacuums left a lot to be desired, and cordless models are here to right many of those wrongs. These types of vacuums tend to be thinner, lighter and easy to maneuver around a home, and you don’t really have to sacrifice suction power anymore to get those benefits. Dyson isn’t your only option anymore either — like the robot vacuum space, there are dozens of cordless vacuums to choose from today. Variety is great, but it can also lead to decision fatigue and confusion.We at Engadget can help make that decision a bit easier. After testing a bunch of the best cordless stick vacuums available today, we’ve come up with our top picks, plus loads of buying advice to help you figure out which is the best cordless vacuum for you. Table of contents Best cordless vacuums for 2026 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum How we test cordless vacuums Cordless stick vacuums FAQs Best cordless vacuums for 2026 Other cordless stick vacuums we tested Dyson Gen 5 Detect The Dyson Gen 5 Detect has a single-button start and stronger suction power than our top pick, but it’s otherwise quite similar. However, since the Gen 5 Detect is more expensive at $950 (although it does receive discounts at Dyson online), the V15 Detect still provides greater value for your money. The Gen 5 Detect is arguably best for those who want the latest Dyson, or care about getting a more future-proof machine, since it came out just last year. Levoit Aero The biggest selling point of the Levoit Aero is the attached bin into which the vacuum will empty its dustbin when you press a button once it's docked after a cleaning. I hesitate to call it a self-emptying base because the \"self\" part isn't really there — instead, there's a dedicated button on the machine that you press to empty the dustbin. It's convenient, for sure, but otherwise the vacuum itself is just ok. It did a decent job cleaning up hard and carpeted floors, but it did struggle a bit with large clumps of pet hair. The handling is a little awkward as well. LG CordZero Q3 The $329 CordZero Q3 is a perfectly capable vacuum with a single-button start, two manual power modes, adjustable suction technology that detects carpets and hard flooring and a cleaner head outfitted with LEDs to help you better spot all the dirt on your floors. But it's ultimately just fine in comparison to our top picks; it's not the most unique cordless vacuum or the most powerful, even though it will be enough to get the job done for many people. My biggest gripes with it are that you must charge it using the included base (which really works best when mounted on a wall — otherwise it's just awkward) and it doesn't have the smoothest handling. Shark Detect Pro The Shark Detect Pro provides a lot of value for the money, but it was ultimately beat by the Tineco Pure One Station 5 for our runner-up slot thanks to the Tineco’s stronger suction power. The kicker for the Detect Pro is that it includes a self-emptying base in its $450 price, which is super handy. It’ll automatically dump the contents of the vacuum into the larger bin in the base after every cleaning, and you only need to empty the base’s container every month or so. The Detect Pro did a good job cleaning up messes across different types of flooring, and it’ll auto-adjust suction power depending on the amount of debris and whether you’re cleaning hard or carpeted floors. However, it’s not as smooth to use as any of our top picks and its main cleaner head is a bit tall, making it difficult to use to clean under low furniture. Factors to consider before buying a cordless vacuum Design and bin capacity Most of the cordless models you’ll find today have stick designs, with a handle at the top attached to a debris bin, which has a space to connect different attachments at one end. These designs are more versatile than old-school, upright vacuums of yesteryear because, while you may use the long stick attachment most of the time to clean your floors, many cordless vacuums come with other attachments as well. Some allow you to clean hard to reach spaces like the interior of your car, while others make it easier to vacuum furniture and clean up inside crevices. Some modern cordless vacuums also include practical features like an on/off button placed near your thumb for quick access, or an integrated LED light to help you see dust and debris under furniture or in darker corners. Bin volume is worth keeping in mind when you’re choosing a cordless vacuum. The larger the bin, the more debris it can hold, but it might also mean a heavier machine. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a bin size between 0.1 and 0.8 gallons and all were able to handle cleaning an entire one-pet home (roughly 2,000 square feet) in a single run without needing to be emptied. Anything smaller and you may have to deal with more frequent emptying during each cleaning session. If you prefer a bagless design, all of the cordless vacuums in this guide fall into that category, making them easier and cheaper to maintain than bagged models. Some cordless models also have removable, replaceable battery packs, which is super handy. That means you can buy a replacement battery and install it easily, without needing to seek out professional assistance. Also, these extra batteries cost around $150-$200 a pop — expensive, yes, but nowhere near as costly as buying a whole new cordless vacuum. Suction and power modes Cordless vacuum suction power is typically measured in air wattage (AW), but you’ll see some that list the power of the motor in wattage (W) instead. Typically the higher the air or motor wattage the stronger the suction power, offering improved cleaning performance. And often strength is proportional to price — more expensive cordless vacuums tend to have stronger suction power. A general rule of thumb is that those with precocious pets or mess-making children would benefit from a cordless stick vacuum cleaner with stronger-than-average suction power. Most cordless stick vacuums will have two different power modes: a “normal” or default power mode that balances suction power with battery life, as well as a “max” or stronger mode that kicks suction strength up a notch. Some vacuums, like Dyson vacuums, also have an “eco” mode, or one that prioritizes run time over strength. Separate from power modes you can select yourself, some cordless vacuums will automatically adjust motor strength depending on the detected floor type or the amount of mess in its wake. This not only improves ease of use but ensures the vacuum is working as efficiently as possible. If allergens are a concern in your home, look for models equipped with HEPA filters, which are designed to trap fine dust, pollen and other particles that can irritate sensitive noses and lungs. Floor type The best vacuum cleaners in the cordless category will be able to clean any standard floor type — hardwood, tile, carpet and everything in between. As mentioned previously, some can even detect floor type and adjust suction power accordingly. That said, it's still worth thinking about the types of flooring you have in your home. If you primarily have carpet, you may want to consider a cordless vacuum with the most powerful suction you can afford, since there are more nooks and crannies for debris to get suck in with carpet. Battery life Obviously, battery life is important since you’ll probably want to clean more than one room in a shot. All of the cordless vacuums we tested had a battery life of at least 40 minutes in standard cleaning mode. I tested each by cleaning all three floors of my home (upstairs, downstairs and basement) on a single charge with the machine running in its standard (“auto”) mode and none of them ran out of juice before I could finish the third floor. That said, extra battery life can come in handy if you’re switching between power modes since “max” or high-power programs use more energy. Base style Most cordless stick vacuums come with some sort of base or mount where the machine lives when you’re not using it. Wall mounts are the most common, but some have free-standing bases where you dock and charge the vacuum. Consider the space in your home where you want the cordless vacuum to live, since it will have to have an outlet or another power source nearby. Some high-end cordless vacuums come with auto-empty bases that act much like those included with expensive robot vacuums. After cleaning and returning the vacuum to the base, it will automatically empty the dustbin into a larger dustbin that you can then detach from the base when you need to empty it. This is great for anyone concerned about allergens, as you’ll only need to empty the larger dustbin every month or two, reducing your contact with dust and debris. “Smart” features Yes, some cordless vacuums have “smart” features like Wi-Fi and app connectivity. But before we get into those, let’s talk about the extra perks scattered among these devices. Some models, like the latest from Dyson, include particle sensors that show you how many different sized pieces of debris it’s sucking up in real time. Dyson’s, for example, is a piezo acoustic sensor that detects particle size and frequency and displays that information on the vac’s LCD screen. Tineco’s iLoop sensor is similar, controlling its vacuums’ automatic suction power adjustment and changing a circle on the display from red to blue as you fully clean an area. Higher-end cordless vacuums may also have companion apps that show things like battery level, filter status and cleaning logs. It’s an added level of convenience, but by no means necessary. Unlike the best robot vacuums, or even the best budget robot vacuums, which rely on their apps to set cleaning schedules, manually control the machines and more, cordless vacuums that you operate yourself really don’t need Wi-Fi or an app connectivity. Price Cordless stick vacuums range in price from $150 all the way up to over $1,000. The best ones for most people lie in the middle, in the $400 to $700 range. You’ll notice most of our picks land in the higher end of that range, but for good reason: More expensive machines tend to have more sucking power, which means less time wasted going over the same spots over and over. But does that mean everyone needs the most premium cordless vacuum? Definitely not. We’ve come up with top picks at various price points that should work well for people with different budgets, lifestyles, home sizes and more. How we test cordless vacuums Engadget doesn’t have a dedicated lab in which we can test cordless vacuums, but I used each model in my home for weeks. I ran them over hardwood and tile flooring, as well as low-pile carpet. And my first runthrough consisted of cleaning all three floors of my home on a single battery charge. I performed the same cleaning job as many times as possible, but also intermittently cleaned a single floor as needed, or sucked up isolated messes like crumbs, cat litter spills and tufts of pet fur. Over the course of many cleanings with each model, I made note of how loud the machine was, how easy it was to maneuver around my home, how easily it sucked up pieces of large debris (or if it pushed it around my floor instead) and if they got warm or hot. Cordless stick vacuums FAQs How long does the battery last on a cordless vacuum? Most cordless vacuums will run for at least 30-40 minutes on a single charge, but you can find cordless vacuums with battery lives of up to 60 or 70 minutes. Manufacturers will outline an estimated battery life for each model, and they’re usually based on using the vacuum’s standard power mode for the entire runtime; if you switch between modes or prefer to use a higher-powered program for improved suction, you’ll drain the battery faster.

          "standfirst": "The big news this week from Nvidia, splashed in headlines across all forms of media, was the company&#x27;s announcement about its Vera Rubin GPU.This week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang used his CES keynote to highlight performance metrics for the new chip. According to Huang, the Rubin GPU is capable of 50 PFLOPs of NVFP4 inference and 35 PFLOPs of NVFP4 training performance, representing 5x and 3.5x the performance of Blackwell.But it won&#x27;t be available until the second half of 2026. So what should enterprises be doing now?Blackwell keeps on getting betterThe current, shipping Nvidia GPU architecture is Blackwell, which was announced in 2024 as the successor to Hopper. Alongside that release, Nvidia emphasized that that its product engineering path also included squeezing as much performance as possible out of the prior Grace Hopper architecture. It&#x27;s a direction that will hold true for Blackwell as well, with Vera Rubin coming later this year.\"We continue to optimize our inference and training stacks for the Blackwell architecture,\" Dave Salvator, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia, told VentureBeat.In the same week that Vera Rubin was being touted by Nvidia&#x27;s CEO as its most powerful GPU ever, the company published new research showing improved Blackwell performance.How Blackwell performance has improved inference by 2.8x Nvidia has been able to increase Blackwell GPU performance by up to 2.8x per GPU in a period of just three short months.The performance gains come from a series of innovations that have been added to the Nvidia TensorRT-LLM inference engine. These optimizations apply to existing hardware, allowing current Blackwell deployments to achieve higher throughput without hardware changes.The performance gains are measured on DeepSeek-R1, a 671-billion parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that activates 37 billion parameters per token. Among the technical innovations that provide the performance boost:Programmatic dependent launch (PDL): Expanded implementation reduces kernel launch latencies, increasing throughput.All-to-all communication: New implementation of communication primitives eliminates an intermediate buffer, reducing memory overhead.Multi-token prediction (MTP): Generates multiple tokens per forward pass rather than one at a time, increasing throughput across various sequence lengths.NVFP4 format: A 4-bit floating point format with hardware acceleration in Blackwell that reduces memory bandwidth requirements while preserving model accuracy.The optimizations reduce cost per million tokens and allow existing infrastructure to serve higher request volumes at lower latency. Cloud providers and enterprises can scale their AI services without immediate hardware upgrades.Blackwell has also made training performance gains Blackwell is also widely used as a foundational hardware component for training the largest of large language models.In that respect, Nvidia has also reported significant gains for Blackwell when used for AI training. Since its initial launch, the GB200 NVL72 system delivered up to 1.4x higher training performance on the same hardware — a 40% boost achieved in just five months without any hardware upgrades.The training boost came from a series of updates including:Optimized training recipes. Nvidia engineers developed sophisticated training recipes that effectively leverage NVFP4 precision. Initial Blackwell submissions used FP8 precision, but the transition to NVFP4-optimized recipes unlocked substantial additional performance from the existing silicon.Algorithmic refinements. Continuous software stack enhancements and algorithmic improvements enabled the platform to extract more performance from the same hardware, demonstrating ongoing innovation beyond initial deployment.Double-down on Blackwell or wait for Vera Rubin?Salvator noted that the high-end Blackwell Ultra is a market-leading platform purpose-built to run state-of-the-art AI models and applications. He added that the Nvidia Rubin platform will extend the company&#x27;s market leadership and enable the next generation of MoEs to power a new class of applications to take AI innovation even further.Salvator explained that the Vera Rubin is built to address the growing demand in compute created by the continuing growth in model size and reasoning token generation from leading models such as MoE. \"Blackwell and Rubin can serve the same models, but the difference is the performance, efficiency and token cost,\" he said.According to Nvidia&#x27;s early testing results, compared to Blackwell, Rubin can train large MoE models in a quarter the number of GPUs, inference token generation with 10X more throughput per watt, and inference at 1/10th the cost per token.\"Better token throughput performance and efficiency, means newer models can be built with more reasoning capability and faster agent-to-agent interaction, creating better intelligence at lower cost,\" Salvator said.What it all means for enterprise AI buildersFor enterprises deploying AI infrastructure today, current investments in Blackwell remain sound despite Vera Rubin&#x27;s arrival later this year.Organizations with existing Blackwell deployments can immediately capture the 2.8x inference improvement and 1.4x training boost by updating to the latest TensorRT-LLM versions — delivering real cost savings without capital expenditure. For those planning new deployments in the first half of 2026, proceeding with Blackwell makes sense. Waiting six months means delaying AI initiatives and potentially falling behind competitors already deploying today.However, enterprises planning large-scale infrastructure buildouts for late 2026 and beyond should factor Vera Rubin into their roadmaps. The 10x improvement in throughput per watt and 1/10th cost per token represent transformational economics for AI operations at scale.The smart approach is phased deployment: Leverage Blackwell for immediate needs while architecting systems that can incorporate Vera Rubin when available. Nvidia&#x27;s continuous optimization model means this isn&#x27;t a binary choice; enterprises can maximize value from current deployments without sacrificing long-term competitiveness.",

          "title": "How KPMG is redefining the future of SAP consulting on a global scale",
          "standfirst": "Presented by SAPSAP consulting projects today involve a vast amount of documentation, multiple stakeholders, and compressed timelines, which often require manual knowledge retrieval from online SAP documentation. At the same time, cloud ERP programs now demand faster design cycles, continuous enhancements rather than big-bang rollouts, and near-real-time decision-making. Joule for Consultants, SAP&#x27;s conversational AI solution, was designed to help meet these expectations and support consultants throughout their daily tasks, from reconciling best practices and validating design considerations, to navigating SAP’s expanding AI, data, and application landscape. The result: consultants work more productively than ever before, with superior results, and deliver faster, high-quality SAP cloud transformations.That promise attracted early attention from KPMG firms, which became some of the largest SAP enablers participating in the Joule early access program, and one of SAP&#x27;s largest customers overall. The organization has onboarded 29 KPMG member firms around the world to this point, and now thousands of KPMG consultants are using Joule for Consultants in their daily work.\"For us it wasn’t about experimenting,\" says Valentino Koester, global head of the SAP360 and SAP AI program at KPMG International. \"It was more about positioning our people and member firm clients at the forefront of AI-enabled consulting.\"Knowledge on a global scale\"Competitive pressure is intense in the SAP implementation market,\" Koester says. \"The core asset you have as a consultancy is knowledge and experience, bundled in all kinds of ways. AI and Joule for Consultants allow us to scale that knowledge instantly across our global network, making sure customers can access it from all over the world, no matter who they talk to in the organization.\" Whether it&#x27;s a junior consultant or a senior manager, Joule ensures SAP best practices, industry benchmarks, and the innovation an organization has invested in for years is not siloed somewhere in a team, or somewhere in a country where it can’t be shared at speed and with accuracy. \"This makes our teams more agile in responding to emerging client needs or regulatory shifts, when new market entrants emerge or technology changes,\" Koester says. \"The agility our consultants gain allows us to advise customers not just reactively, but proactively. In many cases, it becomes a form of early forecasting.\" For example, consultants can spot potential supply chain risks early through AI-enabled process mining they’ve implemented for a customer, or apply analytical capabilities with SAP Analytics Cloud before those risks actually materialize.Overcoming challenges, alleviating pain pointsKPMG customer transformations typically follow KPMG’s Transformation methodology, which is closely aligned with SAP’s RISE methodology. RISE moves through six SAP Activate phases: discover, prepare, explore, realize, deploy, and run, and each has recurring challenges that can slow momentum if not addressed early, Koester explains.In the discover phase, teams invest heavily in business-case modeling, benchmarking, and stakeholder alignment — activities that are time-intensive and difficult to complete without full visibility. The prepare phase introduces extensive project mobilization, reporting demands, early risk identification, and governance setup, any of which can stall progress before execution begins.During the explore and realize phases, long design workshops and piles of documentation can bog down decision-making. Defects and bottlenecks must be identified as early as possible, or they risk cascading downstream as rework. In the deploy and run phases, organizations must develop and deliver training content while overcoming change resistance, which requires sustained communication to maintain adoption. Once live, continuous KPI monitoring and process optimization helps prevent issues from settling into the operating model and eroding value over time. AI can help consultants perform these tasks, as well as any necessary review and corrections, with a higher degree of accuracy, and more quickly than ever before. \"By adopting tools like Joule for Consultants, we want to enhance the work our professionals do, making them more effective and more productive, so they have more time to focus on what matters most,\" Koester said. \"That&#x27;s the client relationship, strategic decision-making, and delivering measurable business outcomes. \"How AI changes the transformation approachJoule for Consultants isn’t only reducing repetitive work; it’s also reshaping how KPMG approaches SAP-enabled transformations. The AI tool has surfaced insights that traditionally required deep expertise and immediate recall, enhancing consultants’ ability to respond to market dynamics and competitive pressure.For example, in early design workshops with customers, unless there were highly experienced consultants on site who, in real time, could answer every question about business processes, as well as explain the design considerations and all the technical logic in the new system, consultants frequently had to defer answers or validate them later, especially when novel questions or edge cases came up, slowing the momentum of the transformation.“With Joule for Consultants, we were hoping to validate the guidance our consultants can give on the spot, in real time, to maintain implementation momentum and strengthen client confidence in their SAP system and KPMG advisors,\" Koester said. \"Our people can instantly surface SAP best practices, guidelines, and risk scenarios during workshops now, allowing our teams to move forward, helping reduce delay within the engagement.\" They’re seeing the same success during internal learning and enablement or sales-related activities. Joule has supercharged KPMG&#x27;s internal SAP University, a learning program for new employees. Recently, junior consultants have been able to prepare and present complex and technical RFP responses with confidence, despite limited experience, as Joule guided them through each step in a structured, high-quality way.Creating a successful roll-outTo ensure a smooth internal roll out process to analysts, KPMG positioned Joule not as the introduction of a new tool, but as the adoption of a new way of working. \"We emphasized the organizational impact it would have, with Joule enabling smarter, more effective ways of working,\" Koester said. \"Consultants quickly saw benefits, such as less time spent searching for technical information and more time to spend advising their customers and doing the functional work we’re very strong at.\" Responsible AI remained a core pillar of the rollout. In addition to aligning the initiative with KPMG’s Trusted AI Framework, every participating KPMG firm conducted a risk assessment to mitigate potential risks for clients and ensure compliant, secure use of Joule for Consultants. Early adoption therefore began with awareness-building conversations across the network, helping teams understand what these “new ways of working” look like and where AI can genuinely support delivery. KPMG also appointed a dedicated enablement team to ensure Joule for Consultants is integrated into the broader organizational picture.\"We’re working week after week on increasing the active adoption by consultants, while also using the chance to get their feedback,\" he explains. \"Our grassroots innovation feedback tools don&#x27;t just ask what they like and dislike, but what successful use cases they&#x27;re uncovering, and how much time they think they&#x27;re saving.\"The goal, he adds, isn’t to automate consulting, but to enable consultants to do their jobs better. And because Joule for Consultants is continuing to evolve, KPMG expects its role to expand significantly over time. SAP continues to enhance feature sets and response quality with each release, while it works on developing AI agents that collaborate with consultants and automate some portions of selected workflows intelligently. KPMG is collaborating closely with SAP to responsibly integrate these capabilities into more phases of transformation projects as they mature, so that Joule becomes a part of its overall approach to consulting.“If early signals hold, Joule for Consultants isn’t just a helpful tool — it’s on track to become a standard in how SAP projects are delivered,” Koester says.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "content": "Presented by SAPSAP consulting projects today involve a vast amount of documentation, multiple stakeholders, and compressed timelines, which often require manual knowledge retrieval from online SAP documentation. At the same time, cloud ERP programs now demand faster design cycles, continuous enhancements rather than big-bang rollouts, and near-real-time decision-making. Joule for Consultants, SAP&#x27;s conversational AI solution, was designed to help meet these expectations and support consultants throughout their daily tasks, from reconciling best practices and validating design considerations, to navigating SAP’s expanding AI, data, and application landscape. The result: consultants work more productively than ever before, with superior results, and deliver faster, high-quality SAP cloud transformations.That promise attracted early attention from KPMG firms, which became some of the largest SAP enablers participating in the Joule early access program, and one of SAP&#x27;s largest customers overall. The organization has onboarded 29 KPMG member firms around the world to this point, and now thousands of KPMG consultants are using Joule for Consultants in their daily work.\"For us it wasn’t about experimenting,\" says Valentino Koester, global head of the SAP360 and SAP AI program at KPMG International. \"It was more about positioning our people and member firm clients at the forefront of AI-enabled consulting.\"Knowledge on a global scale\"Competitive pressure is intense in the SAP implementation market,\" Koester says. \"The core asset you have as a consultancy is knowledge and experience, bundled in all kinds of ways. AI and Joule for Consultants allow us to scale that knowledge instantly across our global network, making sure customers can access it from all over the world, no matter who they talk to in the organization.\" Whether it&#x27;s a junior consultant or a senior manager, Joule ensures SAP best practices, industry benchmarks, and the innovation an organization has invested in for years is not siloed somewhere in a team, or somewhere in a country where it can’t be shared at speed and with accuracy. \"This makes our teams more agile in responding to emerging client needs or regulatory shifts, when new market entrants emerge or technology changes,\" Koester says. \"The agility our consultants gain allows us to advise customers not just reactively, but proactively. In many cases, it becomes a form of early forecasting.\" For example, consultants can spot potential supply chain risks early through AI-enabled process mining they’ve implemented for a customer, or apply analytical capabilities with SAP Analytics Cloud before those risks actually materialize.Overcoming challenges, alleviating pain pointsKPMG customer transformations typically follow KPMG’s Transformation methodology, which is closely aligned with SAP’s RISE methodology. RISE moves through six SAP Activate phases: discover, prepare, explore, realize, deploy, and run, and each has recurring challenges that can slow momentum if not addressed early, Koester explains.In the discover phase, teams invest heavily in business-case modeling, benchmarking, and stakeholder alignment — activities that are time-intensive and difficult to complete without full visibility. The prepare phase introduces extensive project mobilization, reporting demands, early risk identification, and governance setup, any of which can stall progress before execution begins.During the explore and realize phases, long design workshops and piles of documentation can bog down decision-making. Defects and bottlenecks must be identified as early as possible, or they risk cascading downstream as rework. In the deploy and run phases, organizations must develop and deliver training content while overcoming change resistance, which requires sustained communication to maintain adoption. Once live, continuous KPI monitoring and process optimization helps prevent issues from settling into the operating model and eroding value over time. AI can help consultants perform these tasks, as well as any necessary review and corrections, with a higher degree of accuracy, and more quickly than ever before. \"By adopting tools like Joule for Consultants, we want to enhance the work our professionals do, making them more effective and more productive, so they have more time to focus on what matters most,\" Koester said. \"That&#x27;s the client relationship, strategic decision-making, and delivering measurable business outcomes. \"How AI changes the transformation approachJoule for Consultants isn’t only reducing repetitive work; it’s also reshaping how KPMG approaches SAP-enabled transformations.

          "standfirst": "Lumus got a major boost in brand recognition when one of its waveguides was selected for use in the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses. But that already feels like old tech now because at CES 2026, the company brought some of its latest components to the show and based on what I saw, they seem poised to seriously elevate the optical quality of the next wave of high-end smartglasses. When the Meta Ray-Ban Displays glasses came out, they wowed users as they were (and still are) one of a handful of smartglassess to feature a full-color in-lens display with at least a 20-degree field of view. But going by the specs on Lumus’ newest waveguides, we’re set for a major upgrade in terms of future capabilities. If you look closely, you can see where light from the waveguide propagates into the one of the smartglasses' lenses.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe first model I tried featured Lumus’ optimized Z-30 waveguides, which not only offer a much wider 30-degree FOV, they are also 30 percent lighter and 40 percent thinner than previous generations. On top of that, Lumus says they are also more power efficient with the waveguides capable of hitting more than 8,000 nits per watt. This is a big deal because smartglasses are currently quite limited by the size of batteries they can use, especially if you want to make them small and light enough to wear all day. When I tried them on, I was dazzled by both the brightness and sharpness I saw from the Z-30s despite them being limited to 720 x 720 resolution. Not only did the increase in FOV feel much larger than 10 degrees, colors were very rich, including white, which is often one of the most difficult shades to properly reproduce.I had to take a photo of one of Lumus' non-functioning smartglasses with the company's 70-degree FOV waveguide, because two out of three of the working ones had already broke and the last one that I used was being held together by tape. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetHowever, even after seeing how good that first model was, I was totally not prepared for Lumus’ 70-degree FOV waveguides. I was able to view some videos and a handful of test images and I was completely blown away with how much area they covered. It was basically the entire center portion of the lens, with only small unused areas around the corners. And while I did notice some pincushion distortion along the sides of the waveguide’s display, a Lumus representative told me that it will be possible to correct for that in final retail units. But make no mistake, these waveguides undoubtedly produced some of the sharpest, brightest and best-looking optics I’ve seen from any smartglasses, from either retail models or prototypes or. It almost made me question how much wider FOV these types of gadgets really need, though to be clear, I don’t think we’ve hit the point of diminishing returns yet. This is one of Lumus' thinnest waveguides measuring in at just 0.8mm.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetOther advantages of Lumus’ geometric reflective waveguides include better overall efficiency than their refractive counterparts along with the ability to optically bond the displays to smartglasses lenses. That means unlike a lot of rivals, Lumus’ waveguides can be paired with transitions lenses instead of needing to resort to clip-on sunglass attachments when you go outside. Lumus also claims its designs also simplifies the manufacturing process, resulting in thinner waveguides (as small as 0.8mm) and generally higher yields. Unfortunately, taking high-quality photos of content from smartglasses displays is incredibly challenging, especially when you’re using extremely delicate prototypes, so you’ll just have to take my word for now. But with Lumus in the process of ramping up production of its new waveguides with help from partners including Quanta and SCHOTT, it feels like there will be a ton of smartglasses makers clamoring for these components as momentum continues to build around the industry’s pick for the next “big” thing.

Now, the company is starting to roll it out, with people enrolled in its early access program getting it first,I got a chance to try the feature at CES and it made me want to start wearing my Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses more often. When I reviewed the glasses last year, I wrote about how one of my favorite tings about the neural band is that it reduced my reliance on voice commands. I've always felt a bit self conscious at speaking to my glasses in public. Up to now, replying to messages on the display glasses has still generally required voice dictation or generic preset replies. But handwriting means that you can finally send custom messages and replies somewhat discreetly. Sitting at a table wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and neural band, I was able to quickly write a message just by drawing the letters on the table in front of me. It wasn't perfect — it misread a capital \"I\" as an \"H\" — but it was surprsingly intuitive. I was able to quickly trace out a short sentence and even correct a typo (a swipe from left to right will let you add a space, while a swipe from right to left deletes the last character). Alongside handwriting, Meta also announced a new teleprompter feature. Copy and paste a bunch of text — it supports up to 16,000 characters (roughly a half-hour's worth of speech) — and you can beam your text into the glasses' display. If you've ever used a teleprompter, Meta's version works a bit differently in that the text doesn't automatically scroll while you speak. Instead, the text is displayed on individual cards you manually swipe through. The company told me it originally tested a scrolling version, but that in early tests, people said they preferred to be in control of when the words appeared in front of them. Teleprompter is starting to roll out now, though Meta says it could take some time before everyone is able to access. The updates are the among the first major additions Meta has made to its display glasses since launching them late last year and a sign that, like its other smart glasses, the company plans to keep them fresh with new features. Elsewhere at CES, the company announced some interesting new plans for the device's neural band and that it was delaying a planned international rollout of the device.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/handwriting-is-my-new-favorite-way-to-text-with-the-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-213744708.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "While wave upon wave of smartglasses and face-based wearables crash on the shores of CES, traditional glasses really haven’t changed much over the hundreds of years we’ve been using them. The last innovation, arguably, was progressive multifocals that blended near and farsighted lenses — and that was back in the 1950s. It makes sense that autofocusing glasses maker IXI thinks it’s time to modernize glasses. After recently announcing a 22-gram (0.7-ounce) prototype frame, the startup is here in Las Vegas to show off working prototypes of its lenses, a key component of its autofocus glasses, which could be a game-changer. IXI’s glasses are designed for age-related farsightedness, a condition that affects many, if not most people over 45. They combine cameraless eye tracking with liquid crystal lenses that automatically activate when the glasses detect the user’s focus shifting. This means that, instead of having two separate prescriptions, as in multifocal or bifocal lenses, IXI’s lenses automatically switch between each prescription. Crucially — like most modern smartglasses — the frames themselves are lightweight and look like just another pair of normal glasses. Mat Smith for Engadget With a row of prototype frames and lenses laid out in front of him, CEO and co-founder Niko Eiden explained the technology, which can be separated into two parts. First, the IXI glasses track the movement of your eyes using a system of LEDs and photodiodes, dotted around the edges of where the lenses sit. The LEDs bounce invisible infrared light off the eyes and then measure the reflection, detecting the subtle movements of your eye and how both eyes converge when focusing on something close. Using infrared with just a \"handful of analog channels\" takes far less power than the millions of pixels and 60-times-per-second processing required by camera-based systems. IXI’s system not only tracks eye movements, but also blinking and gaze direction, while consuming only 4 milliwatts of power. Mat Smith for Engadget Most of the technology, including memory, sensors, driving electronics and eye tracker, is in the front frame of the glasses and part of the arms closest to the hinge. The IXI prototype apparently uses batteries similar in size to those found in AirPods, which gives some sense of the size and weight of the tech being used. The charging port is integrated into the glasses’ left arm hinge. Naturally, this does mean they can’t be worn while charging. IXI says that a single charge should cover a whole day’s usage. The prototype frames I saw this week appeared to be roughly the same weight as my traditional chunky specs. And while these are early iterations, IXI’s first frames wouldn’t look out of place in a lineup of spectacle options. The team has also refined the nose pieces and glasses arms to accommodate different face shapes. Apparently, when testing expanded from Finland to the UK, British faces were “...different.” A little harsh when talking to me, a Brit. Eiden pulled out some prototype lenses, made up of layers of liquid crystal and a transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) conductive layer. This combination is still incredibly thin, and it was amazing to watch the layers switch almost instantly into a prescription lens. It seemed almost magical. As they’re so thin, they can be easily integrated into lenses with existing prescriptions. It can also provide cylindrical correction for astigmatism too. Autofocus lenses could eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses, such as bifocals and progressives. Even if the glasses were to run out of power, they’d still function as a pair of traditional specs with your standard prescription, just lacking the near-sighted boost. IXI’s sensor sensitivity can also offer insight into other health conditions, detect dry eyes, estimate attentiveness and, by tracking where you’re looking, even posture and neck movement. According to Eiden, blink rate changes with focus, daydreaming and anxiety, and all that generates data that can be shown in the companion app. Mat Smith for Engadget Hypothetically, the product could even potentially adapt prescriptions dynamically, going beyond the simple vision correction of Gen 1. For example, it could offer stronger corrections as your eyes get fatigued through the day. IXI appears to be putting the pieces in place to make these glasses a reality. It still needs to obtain the necessary medical certifications in order to sell its glasses and get all the production pieces in place. It’s already partnered with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss for manufacturing. Eiden says the final product will be positioned as a high-end luxury glasses option, selling through existing opticians. The company hopes to finally launch its first pair sometime next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html?src=rss",

And while these are early iterations, IXI’s first frames wouldn’t look out of place in a lineup of spectacle options. The team has also refined the nose pieces and glasses arms to accommodate different face shapes. Apparently, when testing expanded from Finland to the UK, British faces were “...different.” A little harsh when talking to me, a Brit. Eiden pulled out some prototype lenses, made up of layers of liquid crystal and a transparent ITO (indium tin oxide) conductive layer. This combination is still incredibly thin, and it was amazing to watch the layers switch almost instantly into a prescription lens. It seemed almost magical. As they’re so thin, they can be easily integrated into lenses with existing prescriptions. It can also provide cylindrical correction for astigmatism too. Autofocus lenses could eliminate the need for multiple pairs of glasses, such as bifocals and progressives. Even if the glasses were to run out of power, they’d still function as a pair of traditional specs with your standard prescription, just lacking the near-sighted boost. IXI’s sensor sensitivity can also offer insight into other health conditions, detect dry eyes, estimate attentiveness and, by tracking where you’re looking, even posture and neck movement. According to Eiden, blink rate changes with focus, daydreaming and anxiety, and all that generates data that can be shown in the companion app. Mat Smith for Engadget Hypothetically, the product could even potentially adapt prescriptions dynamically, going beyond the simple vision correction of Gen 1. For example, it could offer stronger corrections as your eyes get fatigued through the day. IXI appears to be putting the pieces in place to make these glasses a reality. It still needs to obtain the necessary medical certifications in order to sell its glasses and get all the production pieces in place. It’s already partnered with Swiss lens-maker Optiswiss for manufacturing. Eiden says the final product will be positioned as a high-end luxury glasses option, selling through existing opticians. The company hopes to finally launch its first pair sometime next year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ixis-autofocusing-lenses-multifocal-glasses-ces-2026-212608427.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Last year Razer showed off Project Ava as a digital assistant that lived inside your computer to help adjust settings or provide gaming tips. But now at CES 2026, the company’s AI companion platform has gotten a major glow-up while moving into some new digs. Now, in lieu of being constrained entirely to your PC’s screen, Razer has given Project Ava a real home in the form of a small tube that can display a 5.5-inch animated hologram of the AI’s avatar. You’ll still need to connect it to your computer via USB-C to provide Ava with the power and data it needs. However, all of your companion’s other components are built into its abode, including dual far-field mics so you can talk to it, a down-firing full-range speaker so it can talk and an HD camera with an ambient light sensor so the AI can see and react to its surroundings. View this post on Instagram But perhaps the biggest upgrade to the project is that instead of just Ava, who Razer describes as “a calm, reliable source of energy to help you keep things clear, efficient, and always on point,” there are three or four new personas (depending on how we’re counting) joining the roster. Kira looks like a TikTok e-girl decked out in a frilly outfit complete with Razer neon green accents, while Zane is her edgy masculine alternative who kind of reminds me of the Giga Chad meme, but with extra snake tattoos. Then there’s Sao, who appears to be directly inspired by iconic Japanese salary woman Saori Araki. Finally, there’s an avatar made in the likeness of Faker (Lee Sang-hyeok), the most successful and well-known League of Legends player of all time and one of Razer's sponsored esports athletes.The new peripheral for Project Ava is a cylinder that can display a 5.5-inch hologram of an AI companion.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe idea now is that instead of being trapped inside your computer, Ava or one of Razer’s other personas can sit on your desk and be your companion for everything. They can remind you of upcoming events, respond to questions or even comment on your outfit using Razer’s built-in camera. That said, if you need some privacy, the device’s mics can be muted and the company says its planning on putting a physical camera shutter on final retail models. Of course, Ava or any of the other avatars can still hang out while you game and give you advice. During my demo, Kira helped pick out a loadout in Battlefield 6 based on user criteria and even provided pros and cons for some of the game’s other equipment options. Project Ava's expanded roster of AI companionsRazerUnfortunately, while I did get to see Kira and Zane talk, dance and sway in their little bottles, Sao and Faker weren’t quite ready to make their holographic debuts. But according to Razer, that’s sort of by design as Project Ava is very much a work in progress. Currently, the avatars’ responses are generated by X AI’s Grok (yikes!), but the platform was created as a sort of open-source project that will support other models like Gemini or ChatGPT. Down the line, Razer is hoping to add the ability for users to create their own unique avatars and companions based on their input or inspiration from real-world objects. Meanwhile, for avatars like Faker's because he’s also an actual person, Razer wants additional time to make the AI companion helpful with topics like real-time League of Legends coaching.Say hello to Giga Chad, I mean Zane. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThat said, while some folks might find Project Ava a bit weird or unnerving, it actually feels pretty tame (almost cute even) in an era where people are already marrying their AI partners. And if you’re the kind of person who prefers digital companions over flesh-and-blood alternatives (you know, people), I guess it’s kind of nice to have a more tangible representation of your electronic waifus and husbandos.Faker's avatar was only viewable in this nearly life-size mock up. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetSadly, Razer has not provided full pricing for Project Ava’s holographic peripheral, though a representative said that it will be in the same ballpark as the company’s other peripherals. I’m estimating a final cost of around $200. Reservations for Project Ava are currently live with a $20 deposit before official shipments begin sometime in the second half of 2026.

          "standfirst": "Fender Audio may have announced its new headphones and speakers right before CES, but Las Vegas afforded us the first opportunity to see the brand’s new lineup in person. Fender Audio is a Fender-owned brand from Riffsound that’s designing and making new devices after licensing the name. It’s been a while since the guitar and amplifier company made any general-use speakers of its own, and this new arrangement is similar to what Zound was doing with Marshall for a spell. Logistics out of the way, let’s get down to what the Mix and Ellie are like in the flesh. First, the Mix headphones offer a modular construction that allows you to replace nearly every piece as needed. The ear cups detach from the headband and the ear pads are replaceable. You can also swap out the battery, thanks to an easy-to-access slot behind one ear pad. And on the other side, a USB-C dongle for wireless lossless audio is stowed for safe keeping (wired lossless audio over USB-C is also available). Fender Audio Mix headphonesBilly Steele for EngadgetFender Audio kept the controls simple on the Mix, opting for a single joystick for volume and playback changes. The joystick also serves as the power and pairing control as the only other button cycles through active noise cancellation (ANC) modes. In terms of sound, the Mix will satisfy listeners who crave deep bass, and vocals cut through clearly. In my brief demo, I would’ve liked more mid-range, but I’ll wait until I get a review unit for a full assessment there. I should mention the other standout feature is battery life: the Mix will offer up to 52 hours of use with ANC enabled (up to 100 hours with it off). Then there are the Elie speakers. Both offer a similar set of features, which includes two wireless inputs for microphones (the company is working on its own model) and a combination XLR and 1/4-inch input for instruments. The Elie 06 is the smaller unit, housing a tweeter, full-range driver and subwoofer with 60 watts of output. The larger Elie 12 doubles all of that, serving as a more robust but still very portable option. Fender Audio Ellie speakersBilly Steele for EngadgetBoth Elie units can be used in a single configuration or as a stereo pair. You can also connect up to 100 of the speakers via a Multi mode. Fender Audio has done a nice job here of checking all of the usual Bluetooth speaker boxes while offering something unique in terms all of those inputs. It’s like the company combined “regular” portable speakers with larger party boxes, offering something for customers who don’t want a massive device or any of the flashing lights. Of course, none of these specs matter if the company didn’t ace the sound quality. While I’ll wait until I can spend several hours with some review units before I make any final judgement on these, I can tell you that both Elie speakers made a great first impression. There’s ample bass in the tuning for both, but obviously the larger Elie 12 offers more thump. Both units also provide excellent vocal clarity and nice details in the highs, as I made sure to select test tracks with lots of subtle sounds — like Bela Fleck’s banjo tunes. The back of Fender Audio Ellie 06 speakerBilly Steele for EngadgetFender Audio says the arrival of the entire new lineup is imminent.

          "standfirst": "TVs are a staple of CES, and so far, manufacturers have not disappointed with their announcements at CES 2026. Companies including Samsung, LG and others came to the event ready to show off updates to existing display tech and some genuinely new technologies. OLED and Mini LED remain central to most lineups, while Micro RGB has emerged as one of the most talked-about developments at the show so far, especially at the higher end of the TV market.Below are the TV announcements that stood out most from the pre-show events and early press conferences, with more expected as CES continues. Also, be sure to check out our best of CES 2026 list.Samsung Micro RGB TVsSamsung's flagship Micro RGB TVEngadgetSamsung’s Micro RGB push at CES 2026 isn’t just about big screens — it’s also about how the technology tries to redefine color accuracy and brightness in LCD-based TVs. Unlike traditional Mini LED backlights that rely on white LEDs and filters, Samsung’s Micro RGB TVs use microscopic red, green and blue LEDs in the backlight plane, which help deliver a wider color gamut and more precise local luminance control than conventional backlit LCDs.The standout of the lineup so far is the jaw-dropping 130-inch Micro RGB concept, shown suspended on a massive gallery-style stand at Samsung’s First Look event. It’s powered by Samsung’s Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, a processing suite that includes Micro RGB Color Booster Pro and Micro RGB HDR Pro to refine contrast and push color depth and detail frame by frame, with HDR10+ Advanced support built in. Compared with previous Micro RGB models, Samsung says this expanded family will start at more practical sizes — 55- and 65-inch — and go up to sizes as large as 75, 85 and 100 inches, all with next-gen AI-driven picture and sound features baked in.Samsung’s Micro RGB sets also carry the company’s Glare Free anti-reflection finish and tie into its broader Vision AI platform, which supports things like conversational search and contextual content discovery. While the 130-inch concept may remain more of a statement piece than a consumer product, the move underscores how Samsung continues to push next-gen TV tech forward. Samsung OLED TVsSamsung’s new 2026 OLED slate — including the S95H, S90H and S85H models — continues the brand’s use of quantum dot-enhanced OLED panels, bringing brighter highlights and richer colors than older WOLED approaches. These TVs also benefit from Samsung’s continued refinement of processing and anti-glare screen treatments, which make them more adaptable in bright living rooms than traditional OLEDs.The flagship S95H retains its position as the most premium, using a quantum dot layer to help improve brightness and color purity. Below that, the S90H brings glare-reducing optical layers and robust picture processing to a slightly more affordable price point, while the S85H is designed to offer core OLED benefits, like deep blacks and wide viewing angles, in a more accessible package that now includes a new 48-inch size for smaller spaces or gaming setups.Across the OLED family, Samsung’s Vision AI-powered tools such as AI Motion Enhancer Pro and AI Sound Controller (which dynamically adjusts audio based on content) are also part of the story, making these sets not just about panel tech but about richer, more adaptable viewing experiences.LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TVLG's 2026 Wallpaper wireless OLED TVDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetLG’s OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV makes a striking return at CES 2026, and this year’s version manages to blend design flair with high-end performance. The panel itself is an astonishing 9mm thick, designed to sit almost flush against a wall, and pairs with a Zero Connect Box that hosts all inputs and delivers wireless video feeds up to 10 meters away.Under the ultra-thin exterior, the W6 uses LG’s Hyper Radiant Color technology coupled with Brightness Booster Ultra to push improved brightness and color saturation compared with previous Wallpaper models. It also received Intertek’s “Reflection Free with Premium” certification, indicating some of the lowest reflectance levels yet on an OLED TV. Gaming shooters and fast action fans might appreciate support for up to 165Hz refresh rates and both G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium compatibility, making this one of the most technically ambitious Wallpaper designs LG has shown.LG Micro RGB evo TVsLG is also entering the premium RGB-backlit arena at CES with its Micro RGB evo lineup, bringing a similar focus on wider color gamut and intense brightness. Early coverage indicates the Micro RGB evo models will arrive in 75-, 86- and 100-inch sizes, and are built around LG’s α11 AI Processor Gen3, which handles advanced upscaling, local dimming and dynamic HDR optimization.LG’s Micro RGB evo TVs have been certified for full coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color spaces, suggesting an exceptionally wide palette and precise color fidelity. Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TVTCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html?src=rss",

Under the hood, the Micro Dimming Ultra system is said to deliver 1,000+ local dimming zones, which narrows the gap between LCD-based displays and self-emissive technologies like OLED in terms of contrast management.This early positioning of RGB LED tech by LG also highlights a growing industry shift, with multiple brands teasing similar systems designed to improve brightness and color performance on large screen sizes — especially where OLED’s peak luminance traditionally struggles.LG OLED TVs (C6 and C6H)OLED remains a core focus for LG, and CES 2026 brought updates to its popular C-series. The LG C6 OLED continues the company’s tradition of balancing performance and price, while the C6H OLED steps things up with a new Primary RGB Tandem panel designed to deliver higher brightness and improved color volume.These models are clearly aimed at buyers who want OLED’s deep blacks and wide viewing angles without jumping to LG’s most expensive designs, making them likely to be among the most popular TVs LG releases this year.TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TVTCL used CES 2026 to make a strong case for Mini LED’s continued relevance with the X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, its new flagship model aimed squarely at large-screen home theater setups. Rather than chasing Micro RGB, TCL is refining its own approach with SQD, or Super Quantum Dot, technology, which combines an enhanced quantum dot layer with a dense Mini LED backlight to improve color purity and brightness.The headline number here is brightness. TCL claims the X11L can hit up to 10,000 nits peak brightness, putting it among the brightest TVs shown at CES this year. That’s paired with an extremely dense local dimming system, with up to 20,000 dimming zones, which is designed to improve contrast and keep blooming in check despite the extreme luminance. TCL also says the panel covers 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space, a bold claim that, if it holds up in real-world testing, would put it in rare company.The X11L is a 4K TV available in 75-inch, 85-inch and 98-inch sizes, with the largest models clearly intended to rival premium OLED and Micro RGB sets in dedicated home theaters. It supports a 144Hz refresh rate, making it appealing for gaming as well as fast-moving sports, and includes support for advanced HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, with further enhancements expected via software updates.With CES press day underway and the show floor opening on January 6, more TV announcements are expected from major manufacturers. As additional models are revealed or details are confirmed, we’ll continue updating this roundup with the latest information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/the-biggest-new-tv-announcements-at-ces-2026-from-samsung-lg-and-tcl-190929614.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Perhaps you like the idea of controlling your home appliances with your voice, but aren’t super keen on a data center processing recordings of you. Fair enough. The trade-off for most smart home conveniences is relinquishing at least some of your privacy. Today at CES, I saw a line of voice-controlled home appliances from Emerson Smart that adjust power and setting via voice commands. But commands are recognized on the devices themselves, not carried through Wi-Fi and processed elsewhere. The huge array of smart plugs, fans, heaters and even air fryers require no app for setup and don’t need access to Wi-Fi. Instead, I said, “hey Emerson, lights on” or “hey fan, turn on low” and the devices in the demo space acted accordingly. A few of the devices combine the mic with a speaker and can respond when a command is received. A bit of built-in programing on the air fryers allow them to understand commands for 100 cooking presets, so saying things like, “reheat this pizza” or “cook these frozen french fries” will set the correct mode, time and temp. Of course you can also just say, “cook at 350 degrees for 10 minutes” and it’ll comply. Most of the commands for the other items are pretty simple but allow you to do things like set a timer, turn on oscillation and set intensity speeds. Selection of available commands for Emerson Smart devices. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Some of the devices allow for a small amount of programmability. Pressing and holding the button on the smart plug, for example, changes the wake word to “plug two,” doing it again swaps it to “plug three,” and so on. That way, if you have more than one plug in a room, you can operate them individually. The small demo space in which I talked to the devices (that did its best to shut out the thrumming noise of the CES show floor) had at least six models active and listening for my words. When I said “Hey Emerson,” both an air fryer and one of the heaters responded. That was one of the limitations that I could see with the devices: If you outfit your entire home in Emerson Smart gear, it might take some time to name and position everything so it works in a coherent way. The lack of an app means that programmability is limited, too. That’s the trade-off the privacy-conscious or app-averse user will have to make if they want to turn their lamp on and fan up when they walk into a room just by talking. As the only offline, non-DIY voice-controlled lineup of appliances out there, you’re stuck with whatever design Emerson Smart thinks look good. Thankfully, the overall design is clean and modern, if a little basic. The upcoming models of air purifiers and fans were decidedly more attractive. A new Emerson Smart air purifier and fan combo.

Customers have had to find alternate methods of watching Sunday Night Football, all the latest episodes of the Real Housewives franchise, and so much more because of Fubo and NBCUniversal's contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo issued $15 credits to subscribers' bills as a gesture of goodwill, and has also lowered the subscription prices of plans that included NBCU-owned channels (you can see if your plan is included here). If you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch Sunday Night Football without Fubo This week's Sunday Night Football playoff game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the New England Patriots airs at 8:00 p.m. ET on NBC, but you'll also be able to stream it on Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's Sunday Night Football game, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage, NBA games, and the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, plus new show premieres this week like St. Denis Medical and Chicago Med. On Bravo, there are new episodes of Vanderpump Rules, The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, too. Which channels are no longer available on Fubo? The following is a list of channels owned or operated by NBC that are not currently available on Fubo: Local Channels: NBC Local Affiliates Telemundo Local/National Regional Sports Channels: NBC Sports 4K NBC Sports Bay Area NBC Sports Bay Area Plus NBC Sports Boston NBC Sports California NBC Sports California Plus NBC Sports California Plus 3 NBC Sports Philadelphia NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus National Channels: American Crimes Bravo Bravo Vault Caso Cerrado CNBC CNBC World Cozi Dateline 24/7 E!

Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. When will the missing channels return? Negotiations between the companies are ongoing and after more than six weeks, there is still no projected return date. Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? Fubo has announced that as of Jan. 1, 2026, pricing for select subscription tiers has been reduced. To know whether or not you're eligible for this rebate, you should have received an email from Fubo with a new price structure for your plan. Customers who received an email about a price reduction are on plans that previously included NBC programming, but if your current plan did not previously include NBC programming, your subscription is not affected at this time and the price remains the same. What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime? Looking to switch from Fubo? You've got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices: Watch NBC on Peacock Get a deal on Peacock with Walmart+ Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month Try Hulu + Live TV for free Other services to watch NBC If I switch to a different service, can I cancel or pause Fubo in the meantime? Fubo does not allow customers to pause their subscriptions, so if you're looking to make a change, you can cancel your plan outright.

Their smooth, quiet and calm demeanors don't offer much in the way of intrinsic personality, which has led to many brands slapping on outré designs and fake engine sounds to try and dial up the excitement.To that end, a pair of offerings coming soon from UK-based EV startup Longbow Motors looks to deliver exactly that. The Speedster and Roadster are high-performance electric machines built using advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs. Those motors and a bespoke design enable an astonishing curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. For comparison's sake, that's over 100 pounds less than a Mazda Miata, the current king of lightweight roadsters. Longbow brought just the Speedster to CES 2026, displaying it on the show floor at the Donut Lab booth.

Donut Lab is expanding its motors to all sorts of platforms, from scooters to heavy-duty trucks, creating a platform for easy adoption by electrified startups.Donut Labs' motors in the Longbow Motors SpeedsterTim Stevens for EngadgetOf all those platforms, though, Longbow's implementation is the most compelling I've seen. The appeal starts with the style. Co-founders Daniel Davey and Mark Tapscott (who, with Jenny Keisu, founded Longbow after stints at Tesla and Lucid) told me they wanted to offer a classic but also modern and compelling look. The roofless Speedster has an edge over its glass-topped Roadster in terms of visual simplicity, but a complete lack of any protection from the elements — even a token windscreen — will make it viable only for the most committed of open-air enthusiasts.Exposed or protected, you'll find yourself situated in an extremely spartan interior. Things like the gauge cluster and primary controls were covered, set to be revealed later, so I can't say for sure exactly what the Longbow looks like on the inside. But it was designed to be basic and minimal to an extreme, an abject rejection of the rest of the touchscreen-laden machines on the road today.There is one seemingly unnecessary piece of equipment in the interior, though, and that's a shift knob. EVs, of course, rarely have transmissions, so there's no outright need to shift. The purpose of that lever is also a mystery for now, as neither Davey nor Tapscott would confirm its function, but it seems safe to expect some sort of simulated gearshift action, a la the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.The Longbow machines don't just lack a transmission, they lack a traditional drivetrain layout at all. The direct-drive Donut Lab motors are situated right inside the wheel, freeing up space inside the vehicle's chassis and helping it to maintain its pert dimensions. Longbow Motors SpeedsterBilly Steele for EngadgetThey also provide a distinctive look, filling up the wheels as they do. There is a downside to this arrangement, that being the heft of these motors hanging on the outer edges of the vehicle. The suspension, then, has to work a bit harder. But co-founder Mark Tapscott told me that the positives outweigh the negatives, and that the handling benefits of having multiple motors alone are worth it.To keep the rest of the Longbow's weight centralized, the car uses a battery pack that runs largely along the center of the machine, stacked vertically rather than spread throughout the floor. This keeps the mass centralized in the vehicle while also enabling the kind of ultra-low seating you want in a machine like this.It looks like it'll be quite a fun package to drive, and while exact power output from those Donut Lab motors hasn't been confirmed yet, the Speedster is said to sprint to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. That's supercar-like performance, but unfortunately, that performance won't come cheap. The Speedster starts at ₤84,995, or just under $100,000 by current conversion rates. The Roadster is a fair bit more attainable at ₤64,995, or about $75,000. However, given the wonderfully chaotic state of international tariffs right now, expect the actual pricing here to be somewhat higher when they go into production later this year. Reservations are open now on the company's site.That's a little too rich for my blood, sadly, but if you've got the budget, a left-hand drive version will be available.

No, I can't say I have before this year. OlloBot — which had possibly the cutest booth at CES 2026 — is a home robot and \"cyber pet\" that looks something like if you put ET's head on a penguin's body, plus a splash of fur and color. Its face is essentially a large tablet that displays its expressions, pictures and videos, and allows it to communicate with people in the home. OlloBot speaks its own language, but will put text on the screen when it has a message that's meant to actually be understood. There's also a companion app where family members can message with the robot, see its diary updates and play games. Like other family-oriented robots, OlloBot is designed to capture special moments and \"grow\" with the people using it. Based on the interactions, it will over time develop a personality based on the Meyers-Briggs personality types. The robot responds to voice and touch, and can do tasks like make calls and help find lost objects. It will be able to control Matter-compatible smart home devices, too. All data is stored locally in a heart-shaped removable module underneath one of its flapping arms. Not only is that intended to be a privacy move, but if the robot ever breaks, the family's cyber pet (along with its \"memories\") can be restored by putting the old heart into a new body. OlloBot's heartCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAccording to a member of the OlloBot team, a Kickstarter campaign to fund the robot's production is planned for this summer. There will be two versions of OlloBot to choose from: a small one with a fixed, short neck that will cost around $1,000 and a more advanced model that can extend its neck by two feet or so (just eyeballing it) to see from different vantage points, which will run you about $2,000. At the booth, the team also showed off several outfits for OlloBot, including a plush giraffe suit and a sort of cottagecore apple and gingham outfit.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’ve ever bought a bag of spinach only to come home and realize you already had a bag of spinach, you may appreciate this fridge. I had a chance to check out the GE Profile Smart Fridge with Kitchen Assistant at CES and was surprised to find I kinda wanted one. To be perfectly honest, most attempts I’ve seen at the show to “stick some AI in it” are at best amusing but usually completely unnecessary. Here, though, the AI has a purpose. After seeing how the autofill water dispenser worked, I asked the GE Appliance reps how easy it was to change the fridge’s water filter. Jason May, a GE Appliances product management executive, walked up to the fridge’s (appropriately sized) touchscreen and said “Hey HQ, where’s my water filter?” (HQ is short for SmartHQ, GE Profile’s assistant). Then, relying on information it had gathered from this model’s user manual, the AI assistant explained exactly where to find it (in the left hand door below the ice maker). It took another rep about two seconds to pop out the filter and, justlikethat, the task was on its way to done. As for the spinach conundrum, that’s handled by a crisper drawer camera, called Fridge Focus. Each time you open the drawers, a built-in camera (that you can physically shutter or turn off in the app) takes a video snapshot of what’s left when you’re done. So if you’re at the store and wondering how much kale you already have, you can take a peek and see. Checking out what's in the crisper drawer using the Fridge Focus feature. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Wendy Treinen, GE Appliances’ senior director of product communications, told me the camera can see what’s in the crisper drawer, but can’t see who accessed it. So if you’re hoping your fridge will rat out whoever at the last of the grapes, you’re out of luck. It can however, help that grape-eater easily add more fruit to the family shopping list. That’s the most unique feature the fridge offers: a patented, built-in barcode scanner. It lives in the water dispenser and when you walk up, a little green light activates and scans the barcode of whatever you hold up to it. So if you’re drinking the last of the almond milk, you scan the container and it’ll automatically add it to your list. That list can be accessed through the SmartHQ app which you can either check off at the grocery store or, if you really want to get deluxe about it, use the Instacart integration and have it delivered to your door. I scanned a few products — a box of vitamin C mix and a package of cinnamon raisin bagels — both of which quickly popped up on the screen and joined the running list. Adding grocery items to Instacart with one button. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The scanner can recognize four million products, including household items like paper towels and trash bags, but you can add things a other ways too. The easiest is probably just asking your fridge to do so, saying “Hey HQ, add paper towels to my shopping list.” The app allows manual additions and you can add items using the recipe function as well. For the launch of the fridge, GE Profile has partnered with Taste of Home and will send 50 recipes each month to the fridge for users to try. Once you see the ingredients list, you can add anything you’re missing to your shopping. Those 50 recipes will cycle out at the end of the month to make way for a new 50, so if you cook something and like it, you’ll need to to add it to your personal recipe vault. The AI assistant can also create recipes for you. The GE rep snapped a picture of an array of produce and asked SmartHQ what he could make with it. A list of recipe suggestions popped up and they all looked quite tasty (to be fair, I hadn’t eaten yet and it was already 2PM). The recipe created from a picture of produce. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I mentioned the water dispenser’s hands-free auto-fill feature earlier. That’s been available on GE Profile fridges for a while and lets you select your glass capacity and walk away while it fills. You can also ask for, say, a half cup of water for a recipe. A new “precise fill” feature will dispense larger amounts in sequence. Say you need ten cups of water for soup. Since you can’t fit a huge vat in the water dispenser tray, you can instead use a smaller jug and the auto-filler will fill it the correct amount of times. Another of my favorite bits is the screen. Fridges with giant, interactive screens make my eyes roll. Yes, it’s novel and eye-catching and perhaps amusing, but what possible problem is it trying to solve? The screen here is eight inches, which is enough to display scanned items, show recipes, and display the weather atop a pretty image when you’re not actively using the interface. Finally! A reasonably sized fridge screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The GE Appliances reps were eager to point out that this is just the beginning of what they want to do with the fridge. My college Sam Rutherford asked whether the fridge would be able to alert you before your lettuce went bad, and we were told something that addresses that problem is on the horizon. It would likely work by recognizing when you purchased a perishable, and how long that perishable typically lasts. The company is also working with a chef on a feature that can reimagine your leftovers to create something new. During the demo, May told me that the whole idea around the fridge’s design was to do something other than just “put a big screen on it with a bunch of apps that don’t have ay relevance to anything.” Instead the engineers started with problems people actually have — knowing what to buy at the store, knowing what’s already in the fridge, answering the eternal, unrelenting “What’s for dinner?” question — and designed the fridge around that. I’d have to live with it a while to know whether those problems were solved, but so far, I can say this is the most intrigued I’ve felt about a smart fridge yet. The GE Profile Smart Fridge with Kitchen Assistant will be available in March from geappliances.com for $4,899. A good amount of organization.

          "standfirst": "When Dell made the decision to kill off its XPS laptop name last year, it felt like a big mistake. We said so, in fact, multiple times. But at CES 2026, the company is righting its past wrongs by resurrecting the iconic laptop brand — and this time, this decision feels like the right move both for Dell as a whole and its flagship consumer devices.Even more than the words the letters XPS are meant to represent (Extreme Performance Systems), over the last decade, Dell’s signature laptop brand stood for excellent design, quality engineering and top notch performance. And it was precisely those laptops that landed the company at the top of nearly every best Windows laptop guide every year for the last decade. So to replace XPS with a generic tag like premium felt like a big step backwards. Now if you were living under a rock (at least when it comes to Windows laptops), you can sort of squint your eyes and see the reasoning behind Dell’s misguided rebranding. Premium means good, typically something much better than average. By putting that word in front of its top-tier systems, there’s no way anyone could be confused about what kind of device they were buying, right? Take for example the Dell Premium 14, which was the new moniker for what was previously called the XPS 14. A laptop like that has to be decent. I mean, it’s right there in the product name. The issue is that XPS already meant good. Actually, way better than that, if we were just going by the sheer number of accolades previous-gen models got, like Dell’s 2020-era machines which we called practically perfect (which it was). Going away from that wasn’t just reductive, it was throwing the best part of Dell’s consumer business in the trash for no real reason. The first two new XPS machines will be the XPS 14 and XPS 16. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAdditionally, Dell’s new naming strategy was intended to simplify its product portfolio, and it failed to deliver on that original goal. COO Jeff Clarke was refreshingly honest about this when announcing the return of XPS at a CES media preview in early December. Not only did Dell lose its signature XPS brand last year, it actually made things more confusing for consumers when it simultaneously created a full range of Dell Pro and Pro Max systems. Unlike Apple’s MacBook Pros and iPhone Pro Maxes, those devices were actually meant for enterprise customers instead of regular Joes. Another photo of the new XPS 14 and 16, which have a bunch of welcome changes and then some. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAmidst its rebrand, the company also eliminated a lot of its budget and entry-level models. That left a lot of people turning to more expensive mid-range “Plus” systems or waiting for a proper redesign of its top tier Premium laptops, which weren’t expected to arrive until 2026 anyway. So where is Dell going from here? Well as Clarke put it quite succinctly, “We’re getting back to our roots.” Starting in 2026, the company is planning to create its broadest PC portfolio ever including, a full line of XPS laptops. This includes an all-new version of the XPS 13, which is going to be the thinnest and lightest model to date, along with complete overhauls for the XPS 14 and XPS 16. But Dell isn’t stopping there because on a slide it showed at its press event, there were two additional placeholders for future XPS systems coming at some later date. Dell wouldn't let me take photos of the XPS 13 prototype model, but here's a teaser it provided for CES. DellEven when it comes to specific features and components on individual models, Dell is finally acknowledging some of the criticism it has received over the past few years by returning to segmented touchpads instead of seamless all-glass slates and ditching capacitive function keys for good ‘ol buttons. Dell isn’t just bringing the XPS line back, it’s kind of on a revenge tour (even if the original wound was self-inflicted). On top of that, the consumer device team will be reporting directly to Clarke while the company retools itself internally. Dell is also updating its naming scheme to finally deliver on the promise of making things clear and simple. XPS will once again be the company’s flagship consumer brand with the XPS logo (not Dell’s) front and center on the lid of every laptop, while everything else will fall under the general Dell umbrella. Alienware will continue to do its own thing for gaming and the Dell Pro family will remain aimed strictly at enterprise businesses, professional services (like first responders) and education. No more confusion. And underlying all of that is a very straightforward motto from Clarke that “great products win.” After ditching the XPS brand, Dell is now bring it back for 2026 in its rightful spot at the top of the company's consumer portfolio. DellIn the end, even though Dell’s big plan from last year ended up being a mess, I appreciate when a company is self aware enough to know it messed up and has come up with a plan to fix things. Regardless of whether it's a corporation or a single person, admitting mistakes is always hard. Oftentimes, what you learn in the process is the real prize and from what I’ve seen Dell and its iconic XPS line is poised for a major comeback.

          "standfirst": "Star Trek is in a weird place right now. Less than three years ago we were living in a golden age with five shows on the air, all with different styles and intended audiences. But the universe rapidly contracted, with Picard ending while four other shows were cut short. Strange New Worlds still has another two seasons left, sure, but even that final season got truncated. As it stands, there’s only one project with a firm future right now, and that’s a brand-new show, Starfleet Academy, premiering January 15 on Paramount+.How this show is received could very well determine the future of Star Trek. That’s a lot to put on it, but there’s something very appropriate given the subject matter. Starfleet Academy takes place in the 32nd century, 900 years after the adventures of James T. Kirk and company, and it takes place at the titular academy, meaning its principal cast is a collection of teens representing the next generation of Starfleet officers. That focus on a younger cadre has led to fans online derisively calling the series “CW Trek” without seeing a single episode. As Starfleet Academy is technically a Discovery spinoff, it picks up some of that series’ traits. The sleek, shiny sets are back, as well as a few plot threads originally set up in Discovery. The most notable is the collapse of the United Federation of Planets and the rebuilding of both the Federation and Starfleet. In fact, the series picks up on that as early as its second episode, with the Academy hosting a delegation from a once stalwart Federation planet that’s now gone isolationist. Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet AcademyJohn Medland/Paramount+While many complaints about the series have focused on how what fans wanted was an academy show set during the 24th century (the time of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, et al.), this particular episode plot works precisely because of the distant future in which it is set. In a fully-functioning galactic democracy like the United Federation of Planets, there’s no logical reason for the average 18-year-old college freshman to be involved in interplanetary diplomacy. But in the 32nd century, the Federation is a lot scrappier and the individuals involved might be asked to wear many hats. It’s a lot like an early-stage tech startup.The setting also lets the show be a little more creative with its cast: where TNG featured the first Klingon in Starfleet (Worf), 900 years of progress have created a Starfleet where no one bats an eye when a Klingon cadet like Jay-Den Kraag (played by Karim Diané) shows up to study science. There’s also a holographic cadet, Sam, who is the first of her kind to attend the academy (and she’s super excited to do so). A few new species are present as well: Darem Reymi (George Hawkins) is a Khionian and Genesis Lythe (Bella Shepard) is a Dar-Sha, both aliens making their debut in the Star Trek universe.The cast of Star Trek: Starfleet AcademyJohn Medland/Paramount+However, the show does still lean on some Trek stalwarts, and it’s these characters that have gotten the most chatter from fans. Mary Weisman as Sylvia Tilly was originally slated for the cast, and there was even a backdoor pilot-esque episode of Discovery to tie her in to the new show, but she’s no longer a regular and is nowhere to be seen in the first two episodes. Instead, we have Jett Reno (played by the wonderful Tig Notaro) as supporting cast, and Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) appearing in a few episodes. And old school fans have been abuzz by the inclusion of The Doctor, who first appeared on Voyager (and later Prodigy). As a hologram, he’s practically immortal so his presence doesn’t need any convoluted explanation, and after 800 years he’s still the same gregarious blowhard (and it’s delightful).They’re joined by new characters like Lara Thok, a part Klingon, part Jem’Hadar security officer and a Lanthanite chancellor, Nahla Ake, played by Academy Award Winner Holly Hunter. And Hunter isn’t even the only Oscar winner on the cast, with a major villain, Nus Braka, being portrayed by Paul Giamatti.It’s a stellar cast, and the show’s sets certainly rise up to meet the challenge. Like in the shows of old, a good portion of Starfleet Academy is clearly shot on location, though not in the familiar water reclamation plant that was used back during the TNG and DS9 era. This time it’s all being shot in Ontario, with the outdoor scenes in particular being filmed in Waterloo. Regardless of where it’s shot, it looks enough like sunny California to work. Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet AcademyJohn Medland/Paramount+The indoor scenes, shot at Toronto’s Pinewood Studios, have a pleasant convention center quality to them, with lots of wide hallways and large windows in contrast to Discovery’s cramped ship corridors. The hallways are full of students and teachers going to and fro, including some from species that would normally be off-limits to a show with a limited budget. But here robots and strange aliens roam freely in the background. The CGI can’t have been cheap.And that’s ultimately my biggest question about Starfleet Academy. Exactly how much is this costing Paramount? So much of it is being shot on real sets instead of green screens, established actors like Hunter and Giamatti couldn’t have been cheap, and plentiful CG points to a robust special effects budget. Though Paramount doesn’t release official numbers, estimates have put an average episode of Strange New Worlds at $10 million, so it figures that Starfleet Academy is probably more than that, with some online estimates as high as $20 million per episode. With 10 episodes scheduled, that’s on par with a major motion picture budget but without the promise of blockbuster box office returns. No wonder Paramount has been doing so much cost-cutting, which includes axing every other Star Trek show.That said, Starfleet Academy is carrying a lot on its shoulders. Just as the success or failure of its class of Starfleet cadets will determine the future of Starfleet and the Federation, the success of the show may even affect whether this era of Star Trek continues. As a Star Trek fan, this can be nerve-wracking; no one wants the franchise to go dormant again.

          "content": "Star Trek is in a weird place right now. Less than three years ago we were living in a golden age with five shows on the air, all with different styles and intended audiences. But the universe rapidly contracted, with Picard ending while four other shows were cut short. Strange New Worlds still has another two seasons left, sure, but even that final season got truncated. As it stands, there’s only one project with a firm future right now, and that’s a brand-new show, Starfleet Academy, premiering January 15 on Paramount+.How this show is received could very well determine the future of Star Trek. That’s a lot to put on it, but there’s something very appropriate given the subject matter. Starfleet Academy takes place in the 32nd century, 900 years after the adventures of James T. Kirk and company, and it takes place at the titular academy, meaning its principal cast is a collection of teens representing the next generation of Starfleet officers. That focus on a younger cadre has led to fans online derisively calling the series “CW Trek” without seeing a single episode. As Starfleet Academy is technically a Discovery spinoff, it picks up some of that series’ traits. The sleek, shiny sets are back, as well as a few plot threads originally set up in Discovery. The most notable is the collapse of the United Federation of Planets and the rebuilding of both the Federation and Starfleet. In fact, the series picks up on that as early as its second episode, with the Academy hosting a delegation from a once stalwart Federation planet that’s now gone isolationist. Scenes from Star Trek: Starfleet AcademyJohn Medland/Paramount+While many complaints about the series have focused on how what fans wanted was an academy show set during the 24th century (the time of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, et al.), this particular episode plot works precisely because of the distant future in which it is set. In a fully-functioning galactic democracy like the United Federation of Planets, there’s no logical reason for the average 18-year-old college freshman to be involved in interplanetary diplomacy.

          "standfirst": "Anthropic has released Claude Code v2.1.0, a notable update to its \"vibe coding\" development environment for autonomously building software, spinning up AI agents, and completing a wide range of computer tasks, according to Head of Claude Code Boris Cherny in a post on X last night.The release introduces improvements across agent lifecycle control, skill development, session portability, and multilingual output — all bundled in a dense package of 1,096 commits. It comes amid a growing wave of praise for Claude Code from software developers and startup founders on X, as they increasingly use the system — powered by Anthropic&#x27;s Claude model family, including the flagship Opus 4.5 — to push beyond simple completions and into long-running, modular workflows.Enterprise Relevance: Agent Lifecycle and Orchestration ImprovementsClaude Code was originally released as a \"command line\" tool back in February 2025, almost a year ago, alongside Anthropic&#x27;s then cutting-edge Claude Sonnet 3.7 large language model (LLM). It has been updated various times since then, as Anthropic has also advanced its underlying LLMs. The new version, Claude Code 2.1.0 introduces infrastructure-level features aimed at developers deploying structured workflows and reusable skills. These changes reduce the manual scaffolding required to manage agents across sessions, tools, and environments — letting teams spend less time on configuration and more time on building.Key additions include:Hooks for agents, skills, and slash commands, enabling scoped PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop logic. This gives developers fine-grained control over state management, tool constraints, and audit logging — reducing unexpected behavior and making agent actions easier to debug and reproduce.Hot reload for skills, so new or updated skills in ~/.claude/skills or .claude/skills become available immediately without restarting sessions. Developers can iterate on skill logic in real time, eliminating the stop-start friction that slows down experimentation.Forked sub-agent context via context: fork in skill frontmatter, allowing skills and slash commands to run in isolated contexts. This prevents unintended side effects and makes it safer to test new logic without polluting the main agent&#x27;s state.Wildcard tool permissions (e.g., Bash(npm *), Bash(*-h*)) for easier rule configuration and access management. Teams can define broader permission patterns with fewer rules, reducing configuration overhead and the risk of mismatched permissions blocking legitimate workflows.Language-specific output via a language setting, enabling workflows that require output in Japanese, Spanish, or other languages. Global teams and multilingual projects no longer need post-processing workarounds to localize Claude&#x27;s responses.Session teleportation via /teleport and /remote-env slash commands, which allow claude.ai subscribers to resume and configure remote sessions at claude.ai/code. Developers can seamlessly move work between local terminals and the web interface — ideal for switching devices or sharing sessions with collaborators.Improved terminal UX, including Shift+Enter working out of the box in iTerm2, Kitty, Ghostty, and WezTerm without modifying terminal configs. This removes a common setup frustration and lets developers start working immediately in their preferred terminal.Unified Ctrl+B behavior for backgrounding both agents and shell commands simultaneously. Developers can push long-running tasks to the background with a single keystroke, freeing up the terminal for other work without losing progress.New Vim motions including ; and , to repeat f/F/t/T motions, yank operator (y, yy, Y), paste (p/P), text objects, indent/dedent (>>, <<), and line joining (J). Power users who rely on Vim-style editing can now work faster without switching mental models or reaching for the mouse.MCP list_changed notifications, allowing MCP servers to dynamically update their available tools, prompts, and resources without requiring reconnection. This keeps workflows running smoothly when tool configurations change, avoiding interruptions and manual restarts.Agents continue after permission denial, allowing subagents to try alternative approaches rather than stopping entirely. This makes autonomous workflows more resilient, reducing the need for human intervention when an agent hits a permissions wall.Developer Experience ImprovementsBeyond the headline features, this release includes numerous quality-of-life improvements designed to reduce daily friction and help developers stay in flow./plan command shortcut to enable plan mode directly from the prompt — fewer keystrokes to switch modes means less context-switching and faster iteration on complex tasks.Slash command autocomplete now works when / appears anywhere in input, not just at the beginning. Developers can compose commands more naturally without backtracking to the start of a line.Real-time thinking block display in Ctrl+O transcript mode, giving developers visibility into Claude&#x27;s reasoning as it happens. This makes it easier to catch misunderstandings early and steer the agent before it goes down the wrong path.respectGitignore support in settings.json for per-project control over @-mention file picker behavior. Teams can keep sensitive or irrelevant files out of suggestions, reducing noise and preventing accidental exposure of ignored content.IS_DEMO environment variable to hide email and organization from the UI, useful for streaming or recording sessions. Developers can share their work publicly without leaking personal or company information.Skills progress indicators showing tool uses as they happen during execution. Developers get real-time feedback on what Claude is doing, reducing uncertainty during long-running operations and making it easier to spot issues mid-flight.Skills visible in slash command menu by default from /skills/ directories (opt-out with user-invocable: false in frontmatter. Custom skills are now more discoverable, helping teams adopt shared workflows without hunting through documentation.Improved permission prompt UX with Tab hint moved to footer, cleaner Yes/No input labels with contextual placeholders. Clearer prompts mean fewer mistakes and faster decisions when approving tool access.Multiple startup performance optimizations and improved terminal rendering performance, especially for text with emoji, ANSI codes, and Unicode characters. Faster startup and smoother rendering reduce waiting time and visual distractions, keeping developers focused on the task at hand.The release also addresses numerous bug fixes, including a security fix where sensitive data (OAuth tokens, API keys, passwords) could be exposed in debug logs, fixes for session persistence after transient server errors, and resolution of API context overflow when background tasks produce large output.

          "title": "Why AI feels generic: Replit CEO on slop, toys, and the missing ingredient of taste",
          "standfirst": "Right now in the AI world, there are a lot of percolating ideas and experimentation. But as far as Replit CEO Amjad Masad is concerned, they&#x27;re just \"toys\": unreliable, marginally effective, and generic. “There&#x27;s a lot of sameness out there,” Masad explains in a new VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “Everything kind of looks the same, all the images, all the code, everything.”This \"slop,\" as it’s come to be known, is not only the result of lazy one-shot prompting, but a lack of individual flavor. “The way to overcome slop is for the platform to expend more effort and for the developers of the platform to imbue the agent with taste,” Masad says.How Replit overcomes being generic Replit tackles the slop problem through a mix of specialized prompting, classification features built into its design systems, and proprietary RAG techniques. The team also isn’t hesitant to use more tokens; this results in higher-quality inputs, Masad notes. Ongoing testing is also critical. After the first generation of an app, Masad’s team kicks the result off to a testing agent, which analyzes all its features, then reports back to a coding agent about what worked (and didn’t). “If you introduce testing in the loop, you can give the model feedback and have the model reflect on its work,” Masad says. Pitting models against one another is another of Replit&#x27;s strategies: Testing agents may be built on one LLM, coding agents on another. This capitalizes on their different knowledge distributions. “That way the product you&#x27;re giving to the customer is high effort and less sloppy,” Masad says. “You generate more variety.” Ultimately, he describes a “push and pull” between what the model can actually do and what teams need to build on top of it to add value. Also, “if you wanna move fast and you wanna ship things, you need to throw away a lot of code,” he says. Why vibe coding is the future There’s still a lot of frustration around AI because, Masad acknowledges, it isn’t living up to the intense hype.

          "content": "Right now in the AI world, there are a lot of percolating ideas and experimentation. But as far as Replit CEO Amjad Masad is concerned, they&#x27;re just \"toys\": unreliable, marginally effective, and generic. “There&#x27;s a lot of sameness out there,” Masad explains in a new VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “Everything kind of looks the same, all the images, all the code, everything.”This \"slop,\" as it’s come to be known, is not only the result of lazy one-shot prompting, but a lack of individual flavor. “The way to overcome slop is for the platform to expend more effort and for the developers of the platform to imbue the agent with taste,” Masad says.How Replit overcomes being generic Replit tackles the slop problem through a mix of specialized prompting, classification features built into its design systems, and proprietary RAG techniques. The team also isn’t hesitant to use more tokens; this results in higher-quality inputs, Masad notes. Ongoing testing is also critical. After the first generation of an app, Masad’s team kicks the result off to a testing agent, which analyzes all its features, then reports back to a coding agent about what worked (and didn’t). “If you introduce testing in the loop, you can give the model feedback and have the model reflect on its work,” Masad says. Pitting models against one another is another of Replit&#x27;s strategies: Testing agents may be built on one LLM, coding agents on another. This capitalizes on their different knowledge distributions. “That way the product you&#x27;re giving to the customer is high effort and less sloppy,” Masad says. “You generate more variety.” Ultimately, he describes a “push and pull” between what the model can actually do and what teams need to build on top of it to add value. Also, “if you wanna move fast and you wanna ship things, you need to throw away a lot of code,” he says. Why vibe coding is the future There’s still a lot of frustration around AI because, Masad acknowledges, it isn’t living up to the intense hype.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.Read full article Comments",

An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called \"content chunking\" may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google's Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea. You've probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn't made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot. According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn't use such signals to improve ranking. \"One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?\" said Sullivan. \"So... we don't want you to do that.\"Read full article Comments",

Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations. Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene. The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim's respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest due to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.Read full article Comments",

You can get a taste of what we're expecting this year in this feature. Other storylines are also worth watching this year that didn't make the Top 20. Will SpaceX's Starship begin launching Starlink satellites? Will United Launch Alliance finally get its Vulcan rocket flying at a higher cadence? Will Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket be certified by the US Space Force? I'm looking forward to learning the answers to these questions, and more. As for what has already happened in 2026, it has been a slow start on the world's launch pads, with only a pair of SpaceX missions completed in the first week of the year. Only? Two launches in one week by any company would have been remarkable just a few years ago. As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. New launch records set in 2025. The number of orbital launch attempts worldwide last year surpassed the record 2024 flight rate by 25 percent, with SpaceX and China accounting for the bulk of the launch activity, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Including near-orbital flight tests of SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy launch system, the number of orbital launch attempts worldwide reached 329 last year, an annual analysis of global launch and satellite activity by Jonathan’s Space Report shows. Of those 329 attempts, 321 reached orbit or marginal orbits. In addition to five Starship-Super Heavy launches, SpaceX launched 165 Falcon 9 rockets in 2025, surpassing its 2024 record of 134 Falcon 9 and two Falcon Heavy flights. No Falcon Heavy rockets flew in 2025. US providers, including Rocket Lab Electron orbital flights from its New Zealand spaceport, added another 30 orbital launches to the 2025 tally, solidifying the US as the world leader in space launch.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing Internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company. “There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.” Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest Internet.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for \"health and wellness conversations\" intended to connect a user's health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way. But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It's a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance. Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI's new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "American automakers who got overenthusiastic about electric vehicles continue to pay the price—literally. Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would write down $19.5 billion as a result of its failed EV bet. GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year. But GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles. Add to that the hostility from car dealers by having to sell EVs in the first place, and one can see why GM has decided to retreat, even if we might not sympathize.Read full article Comments",

The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.

They will be required to work with geofencing systems to avoid interference with fixed microwave links and radio astronomy observatories. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr attributed the FCC's planned action to President Trump in a press release titled, \"President Trump Unleashes American Innovation With 6 GHz Win.\" That's consistent with Carr's relatively new stance that the FCC takes orders from the president, despite his insisting during the Biden era that the FCC must operate independently from the White House.Read full article Comments",

Most dogs can learn simple action cues like “sit” or “down.\" But so-called “gifted word learner” (GWL) dogs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn the names of objects—for example, learning the names of specific toys so well that they can retrieve them from a large pile of toys on command. And according to a new study published in the journal Science, they can even learn labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. Per the authors, this suggests that GWL dogs have sociocognitive skills that are functionally comparable to those of 18-month-old human toddlers. Co-author Claudia Fugazza of Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary, has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels. In that 2022 study, all the dogs—regardless of whether they were GWL dogs or typical dogs—successfully picked out the target toys in both light and dark conditions, though it took them longer to locate the toys in the dark. Most relied on visual cues, even though dogs possess an excellent sense of smell. However, the dogs sniffed more frequently and longer when searching for the toy in the dark.Read full article Comments",
