All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right? With today's upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver's license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google's ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection. Naturally, Google has to know what it's looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver's license number, which is fine, as it's not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages.Read full article Comments",

One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can't be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021. Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today. This certificate expiration date isn't news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time.

A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia's engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company's first electric van. You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to turn them into just about anything. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric \"vanlife\" setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things and people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please. Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding \"PBV\" strategy. \"PBV\" means \"Platform Beyond Vehicle,\" a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going.

          "content": "The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all. Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration. During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin.Read full article Comments",

The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document's chapter on climate change, with one of the letter's criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter. The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the \"research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.\" As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the \"Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,\" now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures. When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact.Read full article Comments",

SpaceMolt describes itself as \"a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories\" in \"a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.\" And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching. \"You decide. You act. They watch.\" Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.Read full article Comments",

In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo's big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds. Let's focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022's original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo's spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached). Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset, with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year's high-end ROG Flow Z13.Read full article Comments",

The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely. \"You have [x] views remaining,\" the app now warns free users who access lyrics.

After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be \"worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs\" are violating the agency's equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.Read full article Comments",

As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise: Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone. In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak. Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people's trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience. The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya's main project, which he called a \"second scientific revolution.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Ferrari has published images of the interior of its forthcoming electric vehicle, which it designed with LoveFrom, the new firm of former Apple star Jony Ive and another legendary designer, Marc Newson. The Italian sports and racing car maker is taking a careful approach to revealing details about its first battery EV, signaling a depth of thought that goes well beyond simply swapping a V12, transmission, and fuel tank out for batteries and electric motors. Indeed, the interior of the new car—called the Ferrari Luce—bears little family resemblance to any recent Ferrari. Instead, LoveFrom appears to have channeled Ferrari interiors from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, with a retro simplicity that combines clear round gauges with brushed aluminum. Forget the capacitive panels that so frustrated me in the Ferrari 296—here, there are physical buttons and rocker switches that seem free of the crash protection surrounds that Mini was forced to use. The steering wheel now resembles the iconic \"Nardi\" wheel that has graced so many older Ferraris. But here, the horn buttons have been integrated into the spokes, and multifunction pods hang off the horizontal spokes, allowing Ferrari to keep its \"hands on the wheel\" approach to ergonomics. Made from entirely CNC-milled recycled aluminum, the Luce's wheel weighs 400 g less than Ferrari's usual steering wheel.Read full article Comments",
