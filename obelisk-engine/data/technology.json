          "content": "Strava is suing its long-time partner Garmin, and is seeking to permanently block the company from selling most of its current fitness and cycling gadget lineup. The lawsuit filed in the US District Court of Colorado on September 30th, first reported by DC Rainmaker, alleges that Garmin violated an agreement between the companies by infringing on Strava’s patents for segments — route sections where athletes can compare performance times — and heatmaps that show popular areas for activity. Strava is seeking a permanent injunction to prohibit Garmin from selling or offering any products that provide segments or heat mapping features, arguing that “monetary relief alone is inadequate.” Those demands target Garmin’s Connect fitness tracking platform and the majority of Garmin&#8217;s devices, including Edge bike computers, and Forerunner, Fenix, and Epix watches. The lawsuit is surprising, given that these are two of the most recognizable brands in fitness tech and share a lot of integrations between their respective platforms. A trend report that Strava published last year even revealed that Garmin’s decade-old Forerunner 235 was the most popular smartwatch among its worldwide users. The patent for Strava’s segments feature was filed in 2011 and granted in 2015, detailing a system that allows athletes to compare their performances on user-defined routes. Garmin launched the Edge 1000 cycle computer in 2014, which featured its own Garmin Connect segments system. The company later signed a Master Cooperation Agreement (MCA) with Strava in 2015 to bring Strava Live Segments to Garmin devices. In its complaint, Strava says that Garmin violated MCA terms by expanding Garmin-branded segments outside the permitted Strava‑built experience. Separately, Strava claims that Garmin used its patented segment tech to build a competing system across the Garmin Connect platform and hardware ecosystem. Strava also alleges that heat mapping and route suggestion features for Garmin’s devices and Connect platform infringe on two additional patents. One focused on activity heatmaps was filed in 2014, and granted in 2016, with the second covering popularity-based routing features being filed in 2016, and granted in 2017. As DC Rainmaker notes, however, Garmin first introduced heatmaps to Garmin Connect in 2013, prior to Strava’s patent filings. “Garmin received limited permission from Strava to implement Strava Segments on their devices; however, they leveraged this access to carefully study those features, painstakingly copy them, and then release them as Garmin features, and as a result, Strava has sued Garmin to protect its patented inventions,” Strava spokesperson Brian Bell said in a statement to The Verge. “Garmin rejected Strava’s repeated attempts to address Garmin’s infringement informally, forcing Strava to take a stand on the matter and file suit. We do not intend to take any actions that would disrupt the ability of Garmin users to sync their data with Strava, and hope Garmin values our shared users in the same way.” Garmin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.Read full article Comments",

Among other problems yet to be addressed, he warns that today's bipedal humanoids are fundamentally unsafe for humans to be near when they walk due to the massive kinetic energy they generate while maintaining balance. That stored-up energy can cause severe injury if the robot falls or its limbs strike someone.Read full article Comments",

According to reporting by Stat news earlier this week, two immunization program experts—who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the Trump administration—said that because there is no sign-off, states are not yet able to order COVID-19 shots for children who receive vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. The federal program provides vaccines to children who are Medicaid-eligible and under- or uninsured, which includes around half of all children in the US. Typically, federal vaccination recommendations come about after a panel of expert advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—publicly reviews vaccine data and votes on recommendations for use. Then, the CDC director decides whether to adopt those recommendations. While directors don't always adopt ACIP's recommendations, they usually do—and often on the same day as the ACIP vote. After that, the recommendation becomes part of federal vaccine guidance, and insurance companies and federal programs are required to cover the recommended shots.Read full article Comments",

Failure to accept the bargain would result in a withdrawal of federal programs that would likely cripple most universities. The offer, sent to a mixture of state and private universities, would see the government dictate everything from hiring and admissions standards to grading and has provisions that appear intended to make conservative ideas more welcome on campus. The document was sent to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. However, independent reporting indicates that the administration will ultimately extend the deal to all colleges and universities. Ars has obtained a copy of the proposed \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" which makes the scope of the bargain clear in its introduction. \"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" it suggests, while mentioning that those benefits include access to fundamental needs, like student loans, federal contracts, research funding, tax benefits, and immigration visas for students and faculty.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Legendary primatologist Jane Goodall, whose immersive field research living among chimpanzees in the 1960s essentially redefined the relationship between humans and animals, has died at the age of 91. According to the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), Goodall died of natural causes while in California as part of a US speaking tour. \"Jane was passionate about empowering young people to become involved in conservation and humanitarian projects and she led many educational initiatives focused on both wild and captive chimpanzees,\" the institute wrote in a statement. \"[Her] discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science. She was always guided by her fascination with the mysteries of evolution, and her staunch belief in the fundamental need to respect all forms of life on Earth.\" Born in April 1934, Goodall loved nature and wildlife from a very young age, so much so that her father once gave her a stuffed monkey doll that young Jane named Jubilee and kept for the rest of her life. Goodall found an early mentor in paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, who employed her as a secretary at the National Museum in Nairobi. She accompanied Leakey and his wife, Mary Leakey, on a hunt for fossils at the Olduvai Gorge. Impressed with the young woman's potential, Leakey sent her to Tanzania to study chimpanzees in the Gombe forest. He also arranged for her to enter the PhD program in ethology at Cambridge University; Goodall completed her PhD in 1965 with a thesis based on that initial Gombe study. The research program she founded is still active today.Read full article Comments",

We've heard the same story for a while, one of diminishing sales as customers tire of a stale product lineup and are repulsed by the politics of the company's CEO. But Q3 2025 tells a different tale. It's been a good three months for the beleaguered automaker, one that appears to have cleared out a lot of old inventory. Tesla built a total of 447,450 electric vehicles between July and September this year. That's actually a 4.8 percent decrease compared to the same three months last year. The Models 3 and Y production lines saw less of a slowdown—Tesla built 435,826 of these EVs, a 1.8 percent decline on last year. But the Models S and X, grouped together with the US-only Cybertruck, saw the greatest cutbacks.

That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called \"world model\" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities. Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper \"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,\" the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world. In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 \"can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for\" (that's the \"zero-shot\" part of the title) and that video models \"are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.\" But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Netflix has released the full official trailer for director Guillermo del Toro's hotly anticipated new film Frankenstein, starring Oscar Isaac as the brilliant but tragically flawed mad scientist, Victor Frankenstein. Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.” \"It was a religion for me,\" del Toro said during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. \"Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints. And then when I saw Boris Karloff on the screen, I understood what a saint or a messiah looked like. So I've been following the creature since I was a kid, and I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions, both creatively in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Scammers have been abusing unsecured cellular routers used in industrial settings to blast SMS-based phishing messages in campaigns that have been ongoing since 2023, researchers said. The routers, manufactured by China-based Milesight IoT Co., Ltd., are rugged Internet of Things devices that use cellular networks to connect traffic lights, electric power meters, and other sorts of remote industrial devices to central hubs. They come equipped with SIM cards that work with 3G/4G/5G cellular networks and can be controlled by text message, Python scripts, and web interfaces. An unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector Security company Sekoia on Tuesday said that an analysis of “suspicious network traces” detected in its honeypots led to the discovery of a cellular router being abused to send SMS messages with phishing URLs. As company researchers investigated further, they identified more than 18,000 such routers accessible on the Internet, with at least 572 of them allowing free access to programming interfaces to anyone who took the time to look for them. The vast majority of the routers were running firmware versions that were more than three years out of date and had known vulnerabilities.Read full article Comments",

A team of archaeologists recently examined animal bones at sites dating to the waning years of the last Ice Age. Their results suggest that extinct megafauna like giant sloths, giant armadillos, and elephant-like creatures were on the menu for Pleistocene hunters in South America. And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna. Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Argentina's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans.Read full article Comments",

There's no doubt that this happens far less frequently than cord cutting. But TiVo's Q2 2025 Video Trends Report: North America released today points to growth in cord reviving.
