This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB, but neither version is on sale. This particular model easily made our list of the best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2. It even made our list of the best Switch 2 accessories. It just gets the job done. We loved the speed on offer here. It was the fastest of all the cards we tested when transferring games and loading games. We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark. The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn't just for Nintendo's latest console. It'll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends.

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums can be a huge help, keeping your floors clean regularly without much extra work on your part. Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 40 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $150. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots. An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's favorite budget robot vacuum, and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging. This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of its last earning statement. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday will be here before you know it, but you can already save on some sought-after tech. Case in point: the new Apple Watch SE 3. Apple's most affordable smartwatch is even cheaper right now, down to just $200. We consider this to be the best budget Apple Watch, and arguably the best smartwatch for folks who have never owned one before. The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you'll find in those more expensive devices as well. The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 3, which you can snag for $100 off. The sale model comes with 64GB of storage, a 49mm screen and GPS and cellular service. Notably, it's also only available with the one size, adjustable band and in two colors: a Black titanium case with Black Ocean band and a natural titanium Case with Anchor Blue Ocean band. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 came out in early September and is one of the first smartwatches to support satellite communications. This feature means you can call, send messages or share your location with emergency services through the watch — even if you don't have a connection. The new Ultra 3 also has a larger screen thanks to thinner bezels and a battery that can last for up to 42 hours.

          "standfirst": "Dyson is holding an early Black Friday sale on vacuums and related products. Sure, Black Friday isn't for another month, but who are we to turn down a fantastic deal? To that end, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum is a whopping $600 off and down to $400 right now. That's $100 less than its previous all-time low and the cheapest we've seen it. Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) one of the strongest in the category. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we've tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you'll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson's mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you're looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don't mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option. Cordless vacuums are also a part of the sale. Take the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for just $270 at both Dyson and Amazon, which is a discount of $330. That's more than half off. Dyson devices are all over our list of the best cordless vacuums, and for good reason. The company makes effective products. The V9 Motorbar has been designed to clean all floor types, in addition to upholstery. It's also been engineered to squeeze into tight spots, which is great for hitting those oft-neglected parts of the home. The suction power is on point and the battery lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a charge. That's just enough time to vacuum a standard-sized home if you don't stop for too many breaks. The V9 is getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. If you want a newer model, the V11 Extra is on sale for $400, which is a discount of $260. This one boosts the suction power and increases the battery life to 60 minutes.

But it just dropped down to $749, which is the lowest price we've seen since this model was introduced in March. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, across all four colorways, but the 512GB model is also down to $949 — another all-time low versus the Apple Store price of $1,199. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future. (Read: sometime in early 2026). If you need more screen space, you'll find a similar discount on the 15-inch MacBook Air on Amazon, too.

          "standfirst": "Amazon Black Friday deals almost always include discounts on Fire TV devices and Fire TV sets. This year is no different, and some of the best discounts bring Fire TV streaming dongles down to near record-low prices. Case in point: the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 41 percent off and down to only $35. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget's favorite streaming devices. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you'll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers. The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon's Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on Samsung's The Frame) while the device is in standby. It's also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and works well as a retro game emulator, too. The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device's low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff. Also on sale is Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, our pick for the best budget streaming stick. This model doesn't support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it's certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.

This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That's not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still. Audible has a diverse catalog that goes beyond audiobooks. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases. Users also get unlimited access to the Plus Catalog, which houses thousands of audiobooks. Finally, active members get discounts on many audiobooks when looking to purchase.

The company typically reserves this sale for Prime Day, so it's nice to see the deal make an unexpected return. This breaks down to $1 per month for the first three months, which is a boon for audiobook fans. Just make sure to cancel before the 90 days are up, as the subscription will auto-renew at $15 per month. That's not the worst deal in the world, given the vast number of titles available on the platform, but still. Audible has a diverse catalog that goes beyond audiobooks. It also hosts podcasts and Audible Originals. Subscribers get to choose one audiobook each month to keep in their collection for free, including best-sellers or new releases. Users also get unlimited access to the Plus Catalog, which houses thousands of audiobooks. Finally, active members get discounts on many audiobooks when looking to purchase. Winter is coming and this is a good way to make sure you have plenty to listen to throughout the next three months. This deal does have a time limit.

          "title": "How to add someone to an Apple Family account",
          "standfirst": "Apple’s Family Sharing feature is designed to make digital life simpler for households that use multiple Apple devices. It links individual Apple IDs under one family group so everyone can share subscriptions, purchases and storage without sacrificing personal privacy. A single organizer manages the group and decides who’s invited, what’s shared and how payments are handled. Once someone joins, they can access shared Apple services like Music, TV+, iCloud+, Fitness+ or Arcade, along with any compatible third-party apps that support Family Sharing. Setting it up only takes a few minutes, but understanding how it works makes it far easier to manage long-term. Whether you’re adding a new partner, a roommate or creating an Apple ID for a child, the process is similar across iPhone, iPad and Mac, and each person keeps their own private account within the shared ecosystem. Getting started with Family Sharing Before adding someone new, make sure you’re the organizer of the family group. The organizer controls invitations and payment preferences, while each member uses their own Apple ID to sign in. You can manage everything from the Settings app on iPhone or System Settings on Mac. It’s worth checking for software updates first, since Family Sharing menus can vary slightly between iOS versions. When you’re ready, open Settings, tap your name at the top then select Family. From there, you’ll see a summary of your group, any shared subscriptions and the option to add new members. Apple will ask whether you’d like to invite an existing user or create an account for a child who doesn’t yet have an Apple ID. Invitations can be sent through Messages, Mail or AirDrop, and if the person is nearby, you can let them enter their details directly on your device. On a Mac, the process looks a little different but leads to the same result. Open System Settings, select your name then choose Family. You can then add a member, send an invite or set up a child account with appropriate parental controls. Once the invitation is accepted, the person automatically appears in your group list. How to manage what’s shared with Family Sharing When someone joins, they instantly gain access to the subscriptions and features that the organizer has made available. That can include Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness+, along with the shared iCloud+ storage plan if you have one. Photos, calendars and location information can also be shared through the Family section of the Settings app, letting everyone see joint reminders, events or device locations through Find My. If purchase sharing is enabled, everyone in the group can use the organizer’s payment method for App Store and iTunes purchases. Each transaction is still tied to the buyer’s own Apple ID, but it’s billed to the organizer’s payment method. It’s entirely optional, and you can disable it if you’d prefer each person to pay separately. Shared purchases can still be re-downloaded by other members from their purchase history without paying again, so long as the app or media supports Family Sharing. Parents also gain access to tools like Screen Time and Ask to Buy, which give them oversight of a child’s activity. These options appear automatically when you create a child account and can be fine-tuned later from the organizer’s device. For example, Ask to Buy can send a notification each time a child tries to install a new app or make an in-app purchase, letting the organizer approve or decline it in real time. Inviting children and setting boundaries Creating an account for a child works slightly differently from inviting an adult. Apple requires a parent or guardian to set up the account directly from their own device, adding the child’s name, birthday and Apple ID credentials during setup. The age you enter determines what privacy and parental-control features are switched on by default, such as limits on explicit music or app downloads. Once the child’s account is created, it behaves like any other Apple ID but remains tied to the family group until the child reaches the minimum age to leave or until the organizer removes them. Screen Time reports, purchase requests and content restrictions can all be adjusted as the child gets older. It’s a flexible way to give kids their own Apple ID and access to family-purchased content without sharing login details. Common issues and how to fix them Most people can add members without any problems, but sometimes the invitation process can stall. If the person you’re inviting doesn’t see the request, resend it from the Family settings and ask them to check their Messages or Mail. Invitations occasionally end up in spam folders or are filtered by older devices. If they’ve previously joined a different Family Sharing group, they’ll need to leave that one before they can accept your invite. It’s also possible to hit the group limit. Family Sharing supports one organizer and up to five additional members, for a total of six people in one group. If you try to invite more, you’ll be prompted to remove someone before adding another. And if the Family menu doesn’t show the option to add members at all, double-check that you’re signed in with the organizer’s Apple ID, as members without organizer privileges won’t see those options. If someone accepts but can’t see shared subscriptions, open the Subscriptions page under your Apple ID in Settings and ensure the toggle for “Share with Family” is switched on. For iCloud+ storage, confirm that the plan you’re sharing is large enough to include everyone’s data. Why Family Sharing is worth setting up Once everything is configured, Family Sharing can quietly simplify the way your household uses Apple’s ecosystem. Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions or repeating purchases, the organizer can consolidate everything in one place. Each member keeps their personal messages, photos and preferences, but benefits from shared apps, music and cloud storage. It’s also the easiest way to manage children’s digital habits while still giving them independence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-add-someone-to-an-apple-family-account-130033896.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The busiest section of the holiday season is just two weeks away and we’re shoring up our reviews library with some of the products that might be on your list. We’ve got another well-rounded round-up this week, spanning multiple product categories and even taking another look at an older device. Read on for everything you might’ve missed. Apple Watch SE 3 You don’t have to sacrifice as much as you used to if you want to save money on a current Apple Watch. Managing editor Cherlynn Low makes the case for the Apple Watch SE 3, laying out the specific items she missed from the Apple Watch Series 11. “In the end, it wasn’t the features like blood oxygen readings or hypertension notifications that I wanted back,” she explained. “It boiled down to physical components like a brighter display or bigger battery and more durable case that I wanted around for peace of mind.” Apple Vision Pro M5 Apple’s M5 refresh for the Vision Pro is an improvement, but the product still very much feels like it’s in the beta phase. The main problem? Price. “Once again, the Vision Pro feels like a proof of concept — a symbol of what Apple can do when it’s not constrained by traditional screens,” senior reporter Devindra Hardawar said. “But the company’s dream of spatial computing won’t go anywhere until it can deliver cheaper devices.” DJI Neo 2 The biggest problem with the DJI Neo drone was its deafening howl, and on the way to (somewhat) fixing that issue, the company added a host of new features for the Neo 2. The result is a highly capable drone that’s now the best budget option. “It retains everything I liked about the Neo, especially the ease of use and safety features,” contributing reporter Steve Dent wrote. “On top of that, it adds a host of useful functions like obstacle protection and, thank goodness, lower noise levels.” Acer Predator Triton 14 AI Gaming laptops are rarely actually portable. According to senior reporter Sam Rutherford, Acer has managed to fix that with the Predator Triton 14 AI. “In a lot of ways, this isn't just a travel-friendly gaming machine, it's a true do-everything ultraportable,” he explained. OnePlus 15 There’s a lot to like about the OnePlus 15, including the processor, display and battery. What you have to contend with is a basic design and subpar cameras. “If you’re okay with a worse camera overall, the OP15 has a lot going for it, and provided OnePlus can successfully navigate an uncertain tariff regime, it will end up not just one of the best phones of 2025 but much of 2026 too,” senior reporter Igor Bonifacic said. Other reviews you might have missed Those devices aren’t all we’ve been testing over the last two weeks. I spent some time with Bowers & Wilkins’ luxurious Px8 S2 headphones. Reviews contributor James Trew put the Rodecaster Video S through its paces and deputy editor Nathan Ingraham met Alexa+ via the Echo Dot Max. Senior editor Daniel Cooper is keeping tabs on Framework’s modular, upgradable PCs and he reviewed the 2025 update for the Laptop 16. Speaking of laptops, senior reporter Amy Skorheim took on the rare feat of reviewing a laptop charger, proclaiming the Anker Laptop Power Bank as an outstanding option for your gear bag. Sony recently gave the PlayStation Portal a big upgrade, so Devindra had a third review stint with the two-year-old gaming handheld.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-apple-watch-se-3-dji-neo-2-playstation-portal-and-more-130000029.html?src=rss",

Before we get to some of those though, the nominees for the second annual Indie Game Awards were announced this week. There's a nice mix of big hitters and smaller, but equally worthy titles among the Game of the Year contenders. Those are:Absolum - Dotemu, Guard Crush Games and Supamonksand Roger - TearyHand StudioBlue Prince - DogubombCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector - Jump Over the AgeClair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Sandfall InteractiveConsume Me - Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P and Ken \"coda\" SnyderHades II - Supergiant GamesHollow Knight: Silksong - Team CherryKeep Driving - YCJY GamesPipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo - Pocket TrapConsume Me and and Roger are two I've been meaning to check out for a while. I'm also yet to hop into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is arguably the frontrunner here — it's looking like the favorite for top honors at The Game Awards next month as well. There are a whole bunch of worthy contenders in other categories, from hits like Discounty and the charmingly bittersweet Time Flies, to solo-developed projects like Spilled! and Vile: Exhumed. The supremely addictive Ball x Pit picked up a nod, but it's going against the tremendous Öoo (and Absolum, Hades II and Silksong) in the gameplay design category. It's neat to see Playdate game Taria & Como earn recognition too. The Indie Game Awards ceremony takes place on December 18 at 6:30PM ET. You can watch it on YouTube and Twitch. New releasesThe new release I'm most looking forward to trying when I have a chance is Windswept, a precision platformer that's inspired by similar games from the '90s like Donkey Kong Country. Marbles the duck and Checkers the turtle each have unique movement abilities, and you'll need to swap between the pair to best navigate environments. You'll be trying to help them get back home after a storm whisked them away.There are lots of secrets to discover across the 40-plus levels, animal buddies to ride and much more. I grew up with games like this one from WeatherFell and publisher Top Hat Studios, which looks completely up my alley. Windswept is out now on Steam, GOG, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S for $20.The Devolver Digital-published Possessor(s) is something a little different from Hyper Light Drifter studio Heart Machine. This is a horror-inflected Metroidvania and the developers drew inspiration from platform fighters for the combat. Here, high school student Luca forms an alliance with a demon in need of a host following \"an interdimensional catastrophe.\" They team up to stay alive and discover what led to the disaster.As with Heart Machine's other games, it looks very pretty, but reviews for Possessor(s) — which is out on PS5 and PC — have been fairly mixed so far. Things haven't exactly been going great for Heart Machine overall. The studio last month laid off staff and ended development of Hyper Light Breaker, which remains in early access. As with its earlier game Before Your Eyes, Nice Dream says its latest project, Goodnight Universe, is best played with a camera. There's the option to interact with the game using your eye movement and facial expressions. That makes a lot of sense for Goodnight Universe, which casts you in the role of a six-month-old baby with psychic powers. Little Isaac just wants familial love, but a shadowy tech corporation is looking to take custody of him.Skybound Games is the publisher of Goodnight Universe, which is available on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam for $20. A Switch version is coming on December 18, and an update that will bring camera support to the Switch 2 edition is on the way.Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution is a turn-based strategy game that affords you the chance to shift the outcome of the French Revolution. An opportunity to revolutionize the revolution, as it were. You can defend, depose or even reform the monarchy. As the title suggests, you'll have mechs at your disposal in battle — to that end, this reminds me a bit of the clockpunk soulslike Steelrising, which was also set during the French Revolution. Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution, from Studio Imugi and co-publisher 2P Games, left early access on Steam this week. It costs $20.Upcoming I'm very happy to continue this little run of including a dog game in this roundup every week with something new on the beautifully titled Barkour. As part of Steam Animal Fest (which runs until Monday and includes a sale on games like Tunic and Hello Kitty Island Adventure), Varsav Game Studios unleashed a new trailer and an updated Steam demo. Here, you play as Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R., a special agent with gadgets galore and plenty of bite to go with the bark. On missions, you can play the stealthy way, fight your enemies head on or carry out barkour parkour runs. Varsav Game Studios is hoping to release Barkour in 2026.Next up, we have release dates for a pair of cafe sims, starting with Tailside. As a furry cafe owner, you'll be looking to perfect the art of coffee making so you can serve delicious concoctions to your patrons. You can even create foam art on lattes for an extra-special touch.In this game from solo developer Coffee Beans Dev, you can customize your cafe to your liking. There are no timers to worry about, so you can play at your own pace. Tailside is coming to Steam on January 21. A demo is available now.As revealed during the State of Play Japan showcase this week, the latest entry in the Coffee Talk series is bound for Steam, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch on March 5. Chorus Worldwide Games and Toge Productions' Coffee Talk Tokyo places you in the role of a barista who hears out their clientele.The drinks you make (which you can enhance with sprinkle stencils for latte art) help shape your conversations with customers and have a bearing on the branching storylines. Coffee Talk and Coffee Talk Episode 2 composer Andrew “AJ” Jeremy returned to craft another lo-fi soundtrack for the latest installment.A release window for InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories was confirmed during the State of Play Tokyo stream as well. It's coming to Steam and consoles, including PS5, in April. There's a Steam demo available now. From Nagai Industries, this simulator puts you in the role of a college student and employee of a small-town Japanese convenience store (a konbini) in the early 1990s. You'll decide which products to sell, and order and restock goods. More importantly, you'll have to deliver exceptional customer service. That involves having conversations with customers, which will sometimes end up having an impact on their lives. It seems quite lovely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/old-school-platforming-metroidvania-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000751.html?src=rss",

As part of Steam Animal Fest (which runs until Monday and includes a sale on games like Tunic and Hello Kitty Island Adventure), Varsav Game Studios unleashed a new trailer and an updated Steam demo. Here, you play as Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R., a special agent with gadgets galore and plenty of bite to go with the bark. On missions, you can play the stealthy way, fight your enemies head on or carry out barkour parkour runs. Varsav Game Studios is hoping to release Barkour in 2026.Next up, we have release dates for a pair of cafe sims, starting with Tailside. As a furry cafe owner, you'll be looking to perfect the art of coffee making so you can serve delicious concoctions to your patrons. You can even create foam art on lattes for an extra-special touch.In this game from solo developer Coffee Beans Dev, you can customize your cafe to your liking. There are no timers to worry about, so you can play at your own pace. Tailside is coming to Steam on January 21. A demo is available now.As revealed during the State of Play Japan showcase this week, the latest entry in the Coffee Talk series is bound for Steam, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch on March 5. Chorus Worldwide Games and Toge Productions' Coffee Talk Tokyo places you in the role of a barista who hears out their clientele.The drinks you make (which you can enhance with sprinkle stencils for latte art) help shape your conversations with customers and have a bearing on the branching storylines. Coffee Talk and Coffee Talk Episode 2 composer Andrew “AJ” Jeremy returned to craft another lo-fi soundtrack for the latest installment.A release window for InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories was confirmed during the State of Play Tokyo stream as well. It's coming to Steam and consoles, including PS5, in April. There's a Steam demo available now. From Nagai Industries, this simulator puts you in the role of a college student and employee of a small-town Japanese convenience store (a konbini) in the early 1990s. You'll decide which products to sell, and order and restock goods. More importantly, you'll have to deliver exceptional customer service. That involves having conversations with customers, which will sometimes end up having an impact on their lives. It seems quite lovely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/old-school-platforming-metroidvania-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000751.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "EcoFlow is hosting an early Black Friday sale on portable power stations. This drops prices by up to 42 percent on many of its well-regarded products. For instance, the Delta Pro 3 is on sale for $2,299. This is a discount of 37 percent, as the typical cost is $3,699. That's a significant drop in price. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,599. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle. The Delta Pro 3 is just one of the products on sale right now. The Delta Pro Ultra, which is intended as a whole-home backup, is down to $3,999. This represents a savings of more than $2,000. Another Yahoo top pick, the Delta 2 Max, is $1,000 off and down to $899.

While it's possible to do it all yourself, budgeting apps can automate some processes and make it easier to see where your money is going and patterns, both good and bad, that might be occurring. For Black Friday, you can get 50 percent off our favorite budgeting app, Quicken Simplifi. The Quicken Simplifi app is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year. Quicken Classic, the company's \"original desktop software\" for \"experienced investors\" is also half off at $6 monthly, down from $12 monthly. The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. One of the many things that sets Quicken Simplifi apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.

          "title": "Google’s new AI training method helps small models tackle complex reasoning",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at Google Cloud and UCLA have proposed a new reinforcement learning framework that significantly improves the ability of language models to learn very challenging multi-step reasoning tasks. Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL) reformulates problem-solving as a sequence of logical “actions,” providing rich learning signals during the training process.This approach enables smaller models to learn complex problems that were previously out of reach for other common training techniques. Experiments show that SRL not only excels on math reasoning benchmarks but also generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks.SRL is a versatile training framework that can elevate smaller and less expensive models to higher reasoning abilities.The limits of current LLM reasoning trainingRecent advances in training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning have largely been driven by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a method where a model is rewarded based on the correctness of its final answer. By repeatedly trying to solve problems and getting feedback on the final outcome, the model gradually learns effective problem-solving strategies. However, the success of this outcome-based approach depends on the model&#x27;s ability to discover a correct solution within a limited number of attempts, or \"rollouts.\" Since each rollout is computationally expensive, models can&#x27;t try indefinitely. This method hits a wall when problems are so difficult that the model rarely, if ever, finds the right answer within its budget.This creates a critical learning bottleneck. In many multi-step reasoning problems, a model might correctly solve several steps but get derailed by a single mistake, leading to an incorrect answer. With RLVR, this entire effort receives a negative reward, and the model learns nothing from its partially correct work. It’s an all-or-nothing approach that fails to provide granular feedback and provides sparse rewards.An alternative method is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model learns from examples containing the full reasoning process laid out by experts. While SFT can instill reasoning abilities, it often leads to overfitting (the model simply learns to imitate the trajectories in the training data instead of learning to generalize to problems beyond the examples it has seen). This issue is made worse by the fact that high-quality, human-created training data is both scarce and expensive to produce.As the paper notes, these limitations leave \"a critical gap for training small open-source models to effectively learn difficult problems.\"How supervised reinforcement learning worksSRL introduces a framework that reformulates problem-solving as a \"sequential decision-making process,\" striking a balance between pure outcome-based RL and pure imitation learning. Instead of optimizing only for the final answer or forcing the model to imitate an expert&#x27;s entire thought process, SRL teaches the model to reproduce a sequence of key actions that form the backbone of expert reasoning. This allows the model to learn to take actions similar to an expert while developing its own internal reasoning style.In the SRL framework, expert demonstrations are broken down into a series of intermediate, concrete actions, each representing a meaningful step. For a math problem, an action might be an algebraic manipulation. For a software engineering agent, it could be a command executed in a code repository. To generate training data, SRL uses a powerful teacher model to create solution trajectories, which are then used to train a smaller model.According to I-Hung Hsu, a research scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this middle-ground approach is key to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. \"SRL sits in the middle: It captures the structured flexibility of real-world problem solving, where there are multiple valid strategies but also clear notions of what ‘good reasoning’ looks like at each step,\" Hsu told VentureBeat. \"This makes SRL suitable for domains like data science automation or probably supply chain optimization — tasks that reward sound intermediate reasoning rather than mere final answers.\"During training, the model first generates an \"inner monologue\" (its internal reasoning process, enclosed in <think> tags) before committing to an action. At each step, SRL provides a reward based on the similarity between the model&#x27;s predicted action and the expert&#x27;s action. This step-wise reward system provides dense, fine-grained feedback, allowing the model to learn and improve even if its overall solution isn&#x27;t perfect. This solves the sparse reward problem RLVR faces.SRL in actionThe researchers&#x27; experiments show that SRL significantly outperforms strong baselines in both challenging mathematical reasoning and agentic software engineering benchmarks. They also observed that SRL encourages more flexible and sophisticated reasoning patterns in models, such as interleaved planning and self-verification, which improve solution quality without just making the outputs longer.For enterprise leaders, performance gains are only valuable if they don&#x27;t come with runaway costs. Hsu clarifies that SRL-trained models are more efficient in their reasoning. \"The gains come from better reasoning quality and structure, not from verbosity,\" he said. \"In terms of efficiency, SRL-trained models are roughly on par with the base model in token usage... while SRL isn’t designed to reduce inference cost, it achieves stronger reasoning performance without increasing it.\"For the math tests, the team fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on a dataset of 1,000 difficult math questions. They compared its performance against models trained with SFT and RLVR (using the GRPO algorithm common in models like DeepSeek-R1) on four competition-level math benchmarks. The SRL-trained model achieved a substantial 3.0% average performance boost over other methods. The team extended SRL to agentic software engineering, a domain critical for enterprise automation. They trained a coding-specialized model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, on 5,000 expert trajectories of agents interacting with a coding environment. The SRL-trained model was benchmarked against the original base model and SWE-Gym-7B, a strong baseline fine-tuned with SFT. SRL achieved a 14.8% task resolve rate, representing a 74% relative improvement over the SFT-based model. This shows SRL&#x27;s ability to train more competent AI agents for complex, real-world programming tasks.A new standard for high-stakes AI?The paper&#x27;s strongest results came from combining methods: First, using SRL to teach foundational reasoning, then using RLVR to refine that skill. In their experiments, when the researchers used SRL as a pre-training and applied RLVR in post-training, they observed a 3.7% average increase, demonstrating a powerful curriculum learning strategy.This raises the question of whether this could become a new blueprint for building specialized AI.\"We view SRL as a strong foundation,\" Hsu said. \"In a sense, SRL provides a curriculum — teaching models to think and act step by step — before we refine those behaviors with outcome-based reinforcement learning. This SRL-first approach not only stabilizes the later RL stage but also makes reasoning more interpretable and generalizable, which is critical for high-stakes applications.\"Looking ahead, Hsu acknowledges that scaling this pipeline still faces challenges, particularly the high cost and complexity of end-to-end RLVR for agentic tasks. However, he is optimistic about the path forward. \"While high-quality expert trajectories remain important,\" he concluded, \"we think the next big leap will come from automating their generation and filtering — leveraging strong teacher models or even self-improving student models to bootstrap new data.\"",

          "standfirst": "Apple is retiring its Major League Soccer Season Pass and including the next season of MLS as part of its normal Apple TV subscription. Details of a new partnership agreement between Apple and MLS were first reported by The Athletic. The arrangement appears to be similar to the one the company made in October to bring F1 races to all subscribers.Starting in 2026, all MLS games will be available to Apple TV subscribers. That includes regular season matches, and annual events like the Leagues Cup tournament, the MLS All-Star Game, the Campeones Cup and the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs.First announced in 2022, the MLS Season Pass remains one of Apple's most significant forays into sports programming to date. As part of its original agreement with MLS, Apple became the exclusive way soccer fans streamed MLS games globally, eliminating any kind of regional blackout as long as Apple TV was accessible.

          "content": "Apple is retiring its Major League Soccer Season Pass and including the next season of MLS as part of its normal Apple TV subscription. Details of a new partnership agreement between Apple and MLS were first reported by The Athletic. The arrangement appears to be similar to the one the company made in October to bring F1 races to all subscribers.Starting in 2026, all MLS games will be available to Apple TV subscribers. That includes regular season matches, and annual events like the Leagues Cup tournament, the MLS All-Star Game, the Campeones Cup and the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs.First announced in 2022, the MLS Season Pass remains one of Apple's most significant forays into sports programming to date. As part of its original agreement with MLS, Apple became the exclusive way soccer fans streamed MLS games globally, eliminating any kind of regional blackout as long as Apple TV was accessible. That level of access will now continue, without the need to pay $15 a month for MLS Season Pass.

          "standfirst": "Engadget We're about to enter our third week of what feels like a never-ending contract dispute between Disney and YouTube TV that has left YouTube TV customers without access to over 20 Disney-owned channels. Reports estimate that Disney is losing $4.3 million per day during the blackout, you you would think they'd like to resolve the situation quickly, but Disney CFO Hugh Johnston stated ominously earlier this week, \"We’re ready to go as long as they want to.\" On the up side, YouTube TV has finally started issuing $20 credits to customers as consolation for their troubles, but will that be enough to keep their base from jumping ship and finding a new streaming service? As a reminder of how we got here, the Walt Disney Co. pulled its channels from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement, and YouTube TV subscribers have gone without NFL, NBA and NCAA games on ABC and ESPN's suite of channels for two full weeks. With no agreement in sight, YouTube TV subscribers will be left in the dark for this weekend's NCAA football games, and possibly Monday Night Football, too. With huge conference matchups like Texas vs. Georgia and Oklahoma vs. Alabama on ABC and Florida vs. Ole Miss on ESPN this Saturday,, you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods if you rely on YouTube TV for those channels. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options. One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily pause or cancel YouTube TV or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.) Below, we've outlined some of your best options to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, all pulled from our list of best live TV streaming services to cut cable, as well as a comprehensive list of which channels have been affected, and the biggest sporting events of the week that won't be available to YouTube TV subscribers. What games are on ESPN/ABC this week? If you're wondering what games you might miss as a result of the YouTube TV/Disney blackout, here's a list of some upcoming sports you may not want to miss: NCAA Football Friday, Nov. 14 5:30 p.m. | South Carolina State at North Carolina Central | ESPN27:30 p.m. | Clemson at No. 20 Louisville | ESPN Saturday, Nov. 15 12 p.m. | South Carolina at No. 3 Texas A&M | ESPN12 p.m. | No. 9 Notre Dame at No. 22 Pitt | ABC12 p.m. | Kansas State at Oklahoma State | ESPNU12 p.m. | No. 24 South Florida at Navy | ESPN212:45 p.m. | Arkansas at LSU | SEC Network1:30 p.m. | Tennessee Tech at Kentucky| SEC Network +3:30 p.m. | No. 11 Oklahoma at No. 4 Alabama | ABC3:30 p.m. | No. 19 Virginia at Duke | ESPN23:30 p.m. | No. 16 Georgia Tech at Boston College | ACC Network3:30 p.m. | NC State at No. 15 Miami (Fla.) | ESPN4 p.m. | Memphis at East Carolina | ESPNU4:15 p.m. | New Mexico State at No. 23 Tennessee | SEC Network7 p.m. | Florida at No. 7 Ole Miss | ESPN7 p.m. | No. 13 Utah at Baylor | ESPN27:30 p.m. | No. 10 Texas at No. 5 Georgia | ABC7:30 p.m. | Virginia Tech at Florida State | ACC Network7:45 p.m. | Mississippi State at Missouri | SEC Network8 p.m. | Kennesaw State at Jacksonville State | ESPNU10:15 p.m. | TCU at No. 12 BYU | ESPN10:30 p.m. | UC Davis at Montana State | ESPN2 NWSL Sunday, Nov. 16 3 p.m. | NWSL Semifinal: Orlando Pride vs. Gotham FC | ABC NFL Monday, Nov. 17 8 p.m. | MNF: Dallas Cowboys vs. Las Vegas Raiders | ESPN Grab an ESPN bundle so you won't miss the NFL, NBA or any other games Get Hulu + Live TV at a great price Try Fubo free for a week and get $30 your first month Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month What about Sling \"day passes\"? You may have heard that Sling offers day, weekend and week passes to its streaming programming for as little as $5 per day. That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the Sling Orange tier), but ABC isn't included. (If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like Monday Night Football on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge. Get your local Disney/ABC programming for free Need your local ABC programming? Your station may have its own free local streaming news channel (many do), you can see if The Roku Channel carries your local station's news, or download your local news station app if it's a Nexstar channel.

You can plug in your ZIP code at antennaweb.org to see what channels are in your area.

          "standfirst": "Each week, we check major retailers looking for notable discounts on iPads. Those deals almost never show up on Apple's own website, but Target, Walmart and, of course, Amazon tend to have at least a few worthy discounts on Apple's slates. We update this list at least once per week and, while we're at it, we add standout discounts on other Apple gear, from the wearable Apple Watch to the portable MacBook. Why all the focus on Apple devices? The company's gear consistently ranks among our top picks for tablets, smartwatches, laptops and more.It's important to note that we're just heading into the Black Friday shopping season (it used to be just one day, but the beast has grown). So the discounts you see now may very well get even better as we get closer to the end of November. And if you don't see something you were hoping for on sale (thinking specifically about the AirPods Pro 3 here), check back. For now, these are the top deals on Apple gear we could find. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (M3, 13-inch) for $699 ($100 off): We loved the previous generation iPad Air. The latest edition has a faster M3 chip, which excelled in our benchmark tests. Overall, we awarded it an 89 in our review and it's currently our top pick for among the iPad family. This is the model with the larger 13-inch screen, which is a little harder to carry and hold, but will give you more real estate for watching shows and playing games. It went as low as $649 multiple times this year, but this is still a decent $100 discount if you're not able to wait for further discounts closer to Black Friday. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $933 ($66 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's already $50 or so off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in the black colorway is down to $933. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $949. Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Note that the discount only applies to certain colors. Also at Walmart. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,246 ($53 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Max, 36GB memory, 1TB storage) for $3,096 ($403 off): If you're looking for a near-top-of-the-line MacBook, here's a configuration to consider. This has the fastest currently available M-series chip (though with the release of the M5 chip, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are no doubt on their way). For now, this is a beast that only professional users are likely to appreciate. And the price tag matches that power. The MacBook Pro is our recommended MacBook for creatives and we gave the 16-inch, M4-series models a 92 in our review. This is within $20 of the lowest price we've seen for this configuration. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. We gave it a 90 in our review. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model soon, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. The discount linked here is within a dollar of the best deal we've tracked outside of an apparent pricing error on Apple's site. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just need a single tracker, you can grab one for $18 at Amazon.

It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Note that the discount only applies to certain colors. Also at Walmart. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,246 ($53 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Max, 36GB memory, 1TB storage) for $3,096 ($403 off): If you're looking for a near-top-of-the-line MacBook, here's a configuration to consider. This has the fastest currently available M-series chip (though with the release of the M5 chip, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are no doubt on their way). For now, this is a beast that only professional users are likely to appreciate. And the price tag matches that power. The MacBook Pro is our recommended MacBook for creatives and we gave the 16-inch, M4-series models a 92 in our review. This is within $20 of the lowest price we've seen for this configuration. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. We gave it a 90 in our review. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model soon, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. The discount linked here is within a dollar of the best deal we've tracked outside of an apparent pricing error on Apple's site. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just need a single tracker, you can grab one for $18 at Amazon.

Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection.

We also tried out a number of free, ad-supported live TV services (FAST) and included our impressions below. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.Editor’s note: Disney’s channels (which include ESPN, ABC and more) are currently dark on YouTube TV. Google’s streaming service has been in similar situations this year, when contract disputes with Paramount, followed by NBCUniversal threatened to remove those respective channels from the service. Eleventh hour negotiations with both companies prevented any interruptions, but this time subscribers to YouTube TV are unable to watch any Disney property. We have suggestions on how to watch the missing stations, as well as what steps to follow to get the $20 credit YouTube TV is offering current subscribers. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved. There's no internal storage here, but it accepts microSD cards. There's a camera bundle on sale right now that includes a 64GB microSD, three batteries, a dual charger and a case. That pack costs $349, which is a discount of 30 percent.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-gopro-hero-13-black-is-cheaper-than-ever-ahead-of-black-friday-160154066.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "There is a lot of enterprise data trapped in PDF documents. To be sure, gen AI tools have been able to ingest and analyze PDFs, but accuracy, time and cost have been less than ideal. New technology from Databricks could change that.The company this week detailed its \"ai_parse_document\" technology, now integrated with Databricks&#x27; Agent Bricks platform. The technology addresses a critical bottleneck in enterprise AI adoption: Approximately 80% of enterprise knowledge remains locked in PDFs, reports and diagrams that AI systems struggle to accurately process and understand.\"It&#x27;s a common assumption that parsing PDFs is a solved problem, but in reality, it isn&#x27;t,\" Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, told VentureBeat. \"The challenge isn&#x27;t just that documents are unstructured; it&#x27;s that enterprise PDFs are inherently complex. They mix digital-native content with scanned pages and photos of physical documents, alongside tables, charts and irregular layouts, and most existing tools fail to capture that information accurately.\"The hidden complexity behind document parsingWhile optical character recognition (OCR) has existed for decades, Elsen argues that extracting usable, structured data from real-world enterprise documents remains fundamentally unsolved. Key elements such as tables with merged cells, figure captions and spatial relationships between document elements are routinely dropped or misread by existing tools, making downstream AI applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or business intelligence dashboards unreliable.The typical enterprise workaround has been to stack multiple imperfect tools together: One service for layout detection, another for OCR, a third for table extraction, as well as additional APIs for figure analysis. This approach requires months of custom data engineering and ongoing maintenance as document formats evolve.\"To compensate, teams have had to stack multiple imperfect tools or build extensive custom pipelines, spending months on data engineering instead of innovation,\" Elsen said. \"ai_parse_document solves that by extracting complete, structured data from real-world documents — so organizations can finally trust and query unstructured data directly within Databricks.\"Technical approach: End-to-end training vs. pipeline stackingThere are multiple services in the market today for parsing PDFs, including AWS Textract, Google Document AI and Azure Document Intelligence, among others. Elsen argued that instead of just reading text, the tool uses a system of modern AI components trained to end-to-end to extract structured context with state-of-the-art quality.The function goes beyond basic extraction to capture:Tables preserved exactly as they appear, including merged cells and nested structuresFigures and diagrams with AI-generated captions and descriptionsSpatial metadata and bounding boxes for precise element locationOptional image outputs for multimodal search applicationsAll results are stored directly in the Databricks Unity Catalog as Delta tables, meaning parsed documents become queryable structured data without leaving the Databricks environment. This is a key differentiator from cloud services that require exporting data for processing.\"Through data-centric training and optimized inference, we&#x27;ve achieved 3–5x lower cost while matching or exceeding leading systems like Textract, Document AI and Azure Document Intelligence,\" Elsen said.Early enterprise adoption across manufacturing and industrial sectorsSeveral major enterprises have already deployed ai_parse_document in production with use cases spanning data science workflow optimization, democratization of document processing and RAG application development.For example, Elsen noted that Rockwell Automation uses ai_parse_document to reduce configuration overhead for its data scientists. \"What once required significant setup to support complex solutions is now streamlined, letting their teams spend more time innovating and less time managing infrastructure,\" he said.TE Connectivity, meanwhile, is using ai_parse_document to democratize unstructured data processing.\"Previously, extracting tables, text and metadata from documents required complex, code-heavy workflows,\" Elsen said. \"With Databricks, they’ve condensed all of that into a single SQL function, making advanced document processing accessible to every data team, not just data scientists.\"Emerson Electric is another early adopter. The company is using ai_parse_document for a RAG use case. Elsen explained that by enabling parallel document parsing directly within Delta tables, Emerson has made building RAG applications both fast and simple, all within its existing Databricks environment.The platform integration playWhile Databricks has a long history with open source, the ai_parse_document technology is a proprietary component of the Databricks platform.Unlike standalone document intelligence APIs, ai_parse_document is deeply integrated with Databricks&#x27; Agent Bricks platform, which is a collection of AI functions and orchestration capabilities for building production AI agents. The function works with Databricks&#x27; broader data infrastructure, including:Spark Declarative Pipelines: Provide automatic incremental processing, meaning new documents arriving in SharePoint, S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage are parsed automatically without manual orchestration.Unity Catalog: Governs permissions, audit trails and data lineage for parsed content exactly as it does for structured data. Vector Search: Indexes parsed document elements including text, tables and figures with captions for multimodal RAG applications. AI function chaining: Allows developers to pipe ai_parse_document output directly to ai_extract (entity extraction), ai_classify (document categorization) and ai_summarize (content summarization) within a single SQL query.Multi-Agent Supervisor: Coordinates document-processing agents with other specialized agents for complex workflows.\"Parsing is only the beginning and rarely an end unto itself,\" Elsen said. \"The goal is to allow customers to chain our ai_functions, like ai_extract and ai_classify, together with ai_parse_document to turn their documents into actionable data and insights. We also aim to make it seamless to turn a corpus of documents into a knowledge database for use in RAG or other information retrieval agents.\"What this means for enterprise AI strategyFor enterprises building AI agent systems, it&#x27;s critical to understand how PDF documents are actually used and understood by systems. The Databricks approach sheds new light on an issue that many might have considered to be a solved problem. It challenges existing expectations with a new architecture that could benefit multiple types of workflows. However, this is a platform-specific capability that requires careful evaluation for organizations not already using Databricks.For technical decision-makers evaluating AI agent platforms, the key takeaway is that document intelligence is shifting from a specialized external service to an integrated platform capability.",

          "standfirst": "It was originally found in leaked code and publicized by AI influencers on X, but OpenAI has made it official: ChatGPT now offers Group Chats, allowing multiple users to join the same, single ChatGPT conversation and send messages to each other and the underlying large language model (LLM), online and via its mobile apps. Imagine adding ChatGPT as another member of your existing group chats, allowing you to text it as you would one of your friends or family members and have them respond as well, and you&#x27;ll have an idea of the intriguing power and potential of this feature.However, the feature is only available as a limited pilot for now to ChatGPT users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan (all tiers, including free usage).“Group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a shared space to collaborate and interact with others,” OpenAI wrote in its announcement.This development builds on internal experimentation at OpenAI, where technical staffer Keyan Zhang said in a post on X that OpenAI&#x27;s team initially considered multiplayer ChatGPT to be “a wild, out-of-distribution idea.”According to Zhang, the model’s performance in those early tests demonstrated far more potential than existing interfaces typically allow.The move follows OpenAI investor yet competitor Microsoft&#x27;s update of its Copilot AI assistant to allow group chats last month, as well as Anthropic&#x27;s introduction of shareable context and chat histories from its Claude AI models through its Projects feature introduced summer 2024, though this is not a simultaneous, realtime group chat in the same way. Collaborative functionality integrated into ChatGPTGroup chats function as shared conversational spaces where users can plan events, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate on projects with the added support of ChatGPT. These conversations are distinct from individual chats and are excluded from ChatGPT’s memory system—meaning no data from these group threads is used to train or personalize future interactions.Users can initiate a group chat by selecting the people icon in a new or existing conversation. Adding others creates a copy of the original thread, preserving the source dialogue. Participants can join via a shareable link and are prompted to create a profile with a name, username, and photo. The feature supports 1 to 20 participants per group.Each group chat is listed in a new section of the ChatGPT interface, and users can manage settings like naming the group, adding or removing participants, or muting notifications.Powered by GPT-5.1 with expanded toolsThe new group chat feature runs on GPT-5.1 Auto, a backend setting that chooses the optimal model based on the user’s subscription tier and the prompt. Functionality such as search, image generation, file upload, and dictation is available inside group conversations.Importantly, the system applies rate limits only when ChatGPT is producing responses. Direct messages between human users in the group do not count toward any plan’s message cap.OpenAI has added new social features to ChatGPT in support of this group dynamic. The model can react with emojis, interpret conversational context to decide when to respond, and personalize generated content using members’ profile photos—such as inserting user likenesses into images when asked.Privacy by default, controls for younger usersOpenAI emphasized that privacy and user control are integral to group chat design. The feature operates independently of the user’s personalized ChatGPT memory, and no new memories are created from these interactions. Participation requires an invitation link, and members are always able to see who is in a chat or leave at any time.Users under the age of 18 are automatically shielded from sensitive content in group chats. Parents or guardians can disable group chat access altogether via built-in parental controls.Group creators retain special permissions, including immunity from being removed by others. All other participants can be added or removed by group members.A testbed for shared AI experiencesOpenAI frames group chats as an early step toward richer, multi-user applications of AI, hinting at broader ambitions for ChatGPT as a shared workspace. The company expects to expand access over time and refine the feature based on how early users engage with it.Keyan Zhang’s post suggests that the underlying model capabilities are far ahead of the interfaces users currently interact with. This pilot, in OpenAI’s view, offers a new “container” where more of the model’s latent capacity can be surfaced.“Our models have a lot more room to shine than today’s experiences show, and the current containers only use a fraction of their capabilities,” Zhang said.With this initial pilot focused on a limited set of markets, OpenAI is likely monitoring both usage patterns and cultural fit as it plans for broader deployment. For now, the group chat experiment offers a new way for users to interact with ChatGPT—and with each other—in real time, using a conversational interface that blends productivity and personalization.Developer access: Still unclearOpenAI has not provided any indication that Group Chats will be accessible via the API or SDK. The current rollout is framed strictly within the ChatGPT product environment, with no mention of tool calls, developer hooks, or integration support for programmatic use. This absence of signaling leaves it unclear whether the company views group interaction as a future developer primitive or as a contained UX feature for end users only.For enterprise teams exploring how to replicate multi-user collaboration with generative models, any current implementation would require custom orchestration—such as managing multi-party context and prompts across separate API calls, and handling session state and response merging externally. Until OpenAI provides formal support, Group Chats remain a closed interface feature rather than a developer-accessible capability.Here is a standalone concluding subsection tailored for the article, focusing on what the ChatGPT Group Chat rollout means for enterprise decision makers in both pilot regions and globally:Implications for enterprise AI and data leadersFor enterprise teams already leveraging AI platforms—or preparing to—OpenAI’s group chat feature introduces a new layer of multi-user collaboration that could shift how generative models are deployed across workflows. While the pilot is limited to users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, its design and roadmap offer key signals for AI engineers, orchestration specialists, and data leads globally.AI engineers managing large language model (LLM) deployments can now begin to conceptualize real-time, multi-user interfaces not just as support tools, but as collaborative environments for research, content generation, and ideation. This adds another front in model tuning: not just how models respond to individuals, but how they behave in live group settings with context shifts and varied user intentions.For AI orchestration leads, the ability to integrate ChatGPT into collaborative flows without exposing private memory or requiring custom builds may reduce friction in piloting generative AI in cross-functional teams. These group sessions could serve as lightweight alternatives to internal tools for brainstorming, prototyping, or knowledge sharing—useful for teams constrained by infrastructure, budget, or time.Enterprise data managers may also find use cases in structured group chat sessions for data annotation, taxonomy validation, or internal training support. The system’s lack of memory persistence adds a level of data isolation that aligns with standard security and compliance practices—though global rollout will be key to validating regional data handling standards.As group chat capabilities evolve, decision makers should monitor how shared usage patterns might inform future model behaviors, auditing needs, and governance structures. In the long term, features like these will influence not just how organizations interact with generative AI, but how they design team-level interfaces around it.",

          "standfirst": "Nintendo gear is always sought after during the holiday shopping season, but this year likely more so than others. The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

In what it labeled \"the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said that the hackers first chose their targets, which included unnamed tech companies, financial institutions and government agencies. They then used Claude Code to develop an automated attack framework, after successfully bypassing the model’s training to avoid harmful behavior. This was achieved by breaking the planned attack into smaller tasks that didn’t obviously reveal their wider malicious intent, and telling Claude that it was a cybersecurity firm using the AI for defensive training purposes. After writing its own exploit code, Anthropic said Claude was then able to steal usernames and passwords that allowed it to extract \"a large amount of private data\" through backdoors it had created. The obedient AI reportedly even went to the trouble of documenting the attacks and storing the stolen data in separate files. The hackers used AI for 80-90 percent of its operation, only occasionally intervening, and Claude was able to orchestrate an attack in far less time than humans could have done. It wasn’t flawless, with some of the information it obtained turning out to be publicly available, but Anthropic said that attacks like this will likely become more sophisticated and effective over time.

One of the best discounts we're tracking at the moment is on the M4-powered Mac Mini desktop — it's $100 off right now, down from $599 to $499. That applies to the 16GB of RAM/256GB SSD model, and it's pretty close to its all-time-low price. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "title": "'Metroid Prime 4: Beyond' thrillingly brings the series into the modern era",
          "standfirst": "Earlier this year, I played Metroid Prime for the first time in at least a decade. Back in 2023, Nintendo released a remastered version of the 2002 classic for the Switch, and I felt like dusting it off once we finally knew Metroid Prime 4: Beyond would arrive this year after about a decade in development. The original Metroid Prime holds up surprisingly well for a 23-year-old game, but there were plenty of times where it showed its age. The platforming often felt overly clunky, as precise control over Samus Aran is not the game’s strong suit. Similarly, dealing with larger hordes of energy-sucking Metroids could get pretty frustrating, again due to a lack of precision. But the main feeling I came away from the game with was excitement over a fully modernized Metroid Prime experience. I’ve been interested in seeing how the lush alien worlds, monstrous enemies and first-person combat would feel on a current console, built with today’s technology and the many improvements that have come to game design since 2002. I finally got a chance to play about 90 minutes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond last week and nothing I saw diminished my excitement for the series being brought into the current decade — even if the game felt almost too familiar at times.I played two segments of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The first is an opening sequence that Nintendo made available for people to try at the Switch 2 demo experiences earlier this year before the console launched, while the second is a longer slice that takes place on a gorgeous alien planet where it seems the bulk of the game will likely take place. That first segment is the classic “get the player acquainted with the controls” level where Samus flies in to help defend a base under attack. Since I had played the Switch version of Metroid Prime recently, I felt right at home with the controls even though a few buttons were remapped. All of the classic Metroid moves, including charge blasts, the morph ball, the missile cannon, the scanning visor and more are intact here, and I quickly slipped back into the routine of scanning enemies for weak points and blasting away. Right from the jump, the game looks fantastic. There’s an extensive cutscene (at least for a Metroid game) that shows Samus flying in to save the day through a battle-torn base, and everything from the flash of fireball explosions to small details on Samus’s ship give off a level of detail that we simply haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. I was playing the game on the Switch 2, in both handheld mode and hooked up to a TV and it looked great either way. The aforementioned explosions popped nicely in HDR and the frame rate never stuttered in a way that I picked up on. As usual, Nintendo’s art direction is top-notch, but this is the first Metroid Prime game made on a console with some power behind it (remember, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out on the original Wii). The game isn’t quite aiming for photorealistic graphics, but it’s closer than almost any other Nintendo game I can think of. The combo of impeccable style and a modern resolution that finally lets the Metroid world shine is thrilling, and I can’t wait to see more variety in the worlds that Samus explores.There’s also a lot more voice chatter than in the original Metroid Prime. As you get dropped into defending the base under attack, plenty of other soldiers recognize Samus, ask for help, tell her where to go and generally praise her for being a badass. It’s a lot more voice work than I’m used to in a Metroid game, and it goes a long way towards making the journey feel less isolated. A screenshot showing the jungle world of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.NintendoThe second area I got to explore looks even better than the somewhat generic base where the game kicks off. It’s a classic Metroid world that mixes natural beauty with a mysterious, alien culture. And, of course, a lot of the nature wants to kill you for invading its territory (or possibly because it is being controlled by outside forces). The big boss of the demo was cut from this cloth: a giant tentacled plant flinging its giant spiked arms at you and firing off poisonous flowers. A classic Metroid battle if ever there was one, albeit one that felt not wildly different from some of the boss battles from Metroid Prime. That said, the scope of the battle felt bigger, due to the size of the arena and how the plant’s tentacles made maneuvering and getting off clear shots a challenge. While the boss clearly had a central body right in the middle of the room, the tentacles made it feel like it was all around me, at all timesThis boss felt like an upscaled but familiar version of ones from past games, and it was far from the only thing that felt familiar. For example, the game still uses save stations scattered throughout the map to save your progress rather than just autosaving at significant points. That’s a throwback I didn’t exactly miss and didn’t expect to see in 2025. Plenty of the music cues and sound effects felt like they could have been lifted straight from other Metroid Prime games, and the basic move set and weapons Samus has early in the game is nearly identical to how you start Metroid Prime. Naturally, something happens where she loses most of those abilities and has to regain them to progress — in the demo, I had to find the Morph Ball power up to move on, just as you do in nearly every Metroid game before. Samus Aran uses her new abilities to unlock a way forward.NintendoAt times, it felt like the game was leaning a bit too heavily on the already-established framework rather than trying something new. But given that I was early in the game, I’m allowing for there to be a lot of unexpected changes to come. And I did get a chance to try out the biggest gameplay change Nintendo has teased thus far (no, not the motorcycle): new psychic abilities. These powers, at least in the demo, are primarily used for solving environmental puzzles, as they provide a new way to interact with various objects and structures. But there’s also a combat component that I needed to use to beat the aforementioned boss. You can charge and fire off a sort of psychic beam — once it leaves your blaster, time slows to nearly a crawl and you can take control of its direction with the analog stick. While fighting the boss, I had to guide the beam around a host of obstacles to hit each of the three tentacles; once I did that, the monster was vulnerable and I could then charge in and blast it with my conventional weapons. You can see some examples of this power in action in the video below.I wish I got a chance to see how these powers would evolve throughout the game, and I’m definitely intrigued to see how they manage to separate the gameplay in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond from the aspects of it that feel merely like an updated version of what came before. And to be honest, I’m not sad the game feels familiar. Plenty of people haven’t experienced the Metroid Prime series before or haven’t played it in more than a decade, and many of the familiar aspects felt like a perfect example of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” And it won’t be long before we can all find out if Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finds a way to really stand out from its predecessors after all this time.

          "content": "Earlier this year, I played Metroid Prime for the first time in at least a decade. Back in 2023, Nintendo released a remastered version of the 2002 classic for the Switch, and I felt like dusting it off once we finally knew Metroid Prime 4: Beyond would arrive this year after about a decade in development. The original Metroid Prime holds up surprisingly well for a 23-year-old game, but there were plenty of times where it showed its age. The platforming often felt overly clunky, as precise control over Samus Aran is not the game’s strong suit. Similarly, dealing with larger hordes of energy-sucking Metroids could get pretty frustrating, again due to a lack of precision. But the main feeling I came away from the game with was excitement over a fully modernized Metroid Prime experience. I’ve been interested in seeing how the lush alien worlds, monstrous enemies and first-person combat would feel on a current console, built with today’s technology and the many improvements that have come to game design since 2002. I finally got a chance to play about 90 minutes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond last week and nothing I saw diminished my excitement for the series being brought into the current decade — even if the game felt almost too familiar at times.I played two segments of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The first is an opening sequence that Nintendo made available for people to try at the Switch 2 demo experiences earlier this year before the console launched, while the second is a longer slice that takes place on a gorgeous alien planet where it seems the bulk of the game will likely take place. That first segment is the classic “get the player acquainted with the controls” level where Samus flies in to help defend a base under attack. Since I had played the Switch version of Metroid Prime recently, I felt right at home with the controls even though a few buttons were remapped. All of the classic Metroid moves, including charge blasts, the morph ball, the missile cannon, the scanning visor and more are intact here, and I quickly slipped back into the routine of scanning enemies for weak points and blasting away. Right from the jump, the game looks fantastic. There’s an extensive cutscene (at least for a Metroid game) that shows Samus flying in to save the day through a battle-torn base, and everything from the flash of fireball explosions to small details on Samus’s ship give off a level of detail that we simply haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. I was playing the game on the Switch 2, in both handheld mode and hooked up to a TV and it looked great either way. The aforementioned explosions popped nicely in HDR and the frame rate never stuttered in a way that I picked up on. As usual, Nintendo’s art direction is top-notch, but this is the first Metroid Prime game made on a console with some power behind it (remember, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out on the original Wii). The game isn’t quite aiming for photorealistic graphics, but it’s closer than almost any other Nintendo game I can think of. The combo of impeccable style and a modern resolution that finally lets the Metroid world shine is thrilling, and I can’t wait to see more variety in the worlds that Samus explores.There’s also a lot more voice chatter than in the original Metroid Prime. As you get dropped into defending the base under attack, plenty of other soldiers recognize Samus, ask for help, tell her where to go and generally praise her for being a badass. It’s a lot more voice work than I’m used to in a Metroid game, and it goes a long way towards making the journey feel less isolated. A screenshot showing the jungle world of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.NintendoThe second area I got to explore looks even better than the somewhat generic base where the game kicks off. It’s a classic Metroid world that mixes natural beauty with a mysterious, alien culture. And, of course, a lot of the nature wants to kill you for invading its territory (or possibly because it is being controlled by outside forces). The big boss of the demo was cut from this cloth: a giant tentacled plant flinging its giant spiked arms at you and firing off poisonous flowers. A classic Metroid battle if ever there was one, albeit one that felt not wildly different from some of the boss battles from Metroid Prime. That said, the scope of the battle felt bigger, due to the size of the arena and how the plant’s tentacles made maneuvering and getting off clear shots a challenge. While the boss clearly had a central body right in the middle of the room, the tentacles made it feel like it was all around me, at all timesThis boss felt like an upscaled but familiar version of ones from past games, and it was far from the only thing that felt familiar. For example, the game still uses save stations scattered throughout the map to save your progress rather than just autosaving at significant points. That’s a throwback I didn’t exactly miss and didn’t expect to see in 2025. Plenty of the music cues and sound effects felt like they could have been lifted straight from other Metroid Prime games, and the basic move set and weapons Samus has early in the game is nearly identical to how you start Metroid Prime. Naturally, something happens where she loses most of those abilities and has to regain them to progress — in the demo, I had to find the Morph Ball power up to move on, just as you do in nearly every Metroid game before. Samus Aran uses her new abilities to unlock a way forward.NintendoAt times, it felt like the game was leaning a bit too heavily on the already-established framework rather than trying something new. But given that I was early in the game, I’m allowing for there to be a lot of unexpected changes to come. And I did get a chance to try out the biggest gameplay change Nintendo has teased thus far (no, not the motorcycle): new psychic abilities. These powers, at least in the demo, are primarily used for solving environmental puzzles, as they provide a new way to interact with various objects and structures. But there’s also a combat component that I needed to use to beat the aforementioned boss. You can charge and fire off a sort of psychic beam — once it leaves your blaster, time slows to nearly a crawl and you can take control of its direction with the analog stick. While fighting the boss, I had to guide the beam around a host of obstacles to hit each of the three tentacles; once I did that, the monster was vulnerable and I could then charge in and blast it with my conventional weapons.

In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste.

At first, it could only stream games from your PlayStation 5, it lacked core features for a handheld like Bluetooth audio and it felt a bit overpriced at $200 for such a limited product. Add on the fact that home streaming can be notoriously unreliable, since it depends entirely on your ISP and home networking setup, and the Portal simply didn't make much sense. But in 2024 Sony finally added limited cloud streaming for PS Plus titles, and last week it went even further by letting you stream games you own directly from the cloud. All of a sudden, the PlayStation Portal doesn't seem so crazy after all. It also helps that the Portal is still $200 (or less at Gamestop and other retailers), while the cheapest Digital Edition PlayStation 5 has jumped to $500 (up from $400 at launch). Sure, it's still far from a perfect device, but at least it's more functional and significantly less than the PS5 today. Just be aware you'll need to subscribe to the $18 a month (or $160 a year) PlayStation Plus Premium plan to access the cloud streaming features.While my hardware frustrations with the PlayStation Portal remain (more on those later), I can't deny that it's a genuinely great handheld for streaming games from the cloud. Jumping into Ghost of Yotei typically takes between 15 to 30 seconds, and it often loads directly into the game world if I'm continuing from a recent session. The game also plays smoothly, with no noticeable stuttering or lag, and I can still choose between the graphics-heavy 30 fps modes or the smoother 60 fps performance option. It's far from the ideal way to play Ghost of Yotei, which demands an enormous screen and capable speakers, but it's fine in a pinch.In comparison, using Remote Play to access my PlayStation 5 Pro remains as headache-inducing as it did when the PS Portal launched. The handheld can't consistently wake up the PS5 Pro from standby mode, so I'm forced to turn on the console manually if I ever plan to use the Portal. If my PS5 Pro is on, the Portal can typically connect in around five seconds, and it takes another five to ten seconds to launch Ghost of Yotei. Gameplay is typically smooth via Remote Play, but there's occasional stuttering that can interfere with intense combat sequences. PlayStation Portal playing Ghost of Yotei.Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetMy main issue with the PlayStation Portal at launch was that I simply couldn't trust it. Sometimes it would let me remotely connect to my console with no problems, and sometimes it would simply refuse. I've got a fairly robust Wi-Fi 6 networking setup and AT&T gigabit fiber, so my connectivity shouldn't be much of an issue. But clearly something about my networking configuration doesn't play well with the Portal for Remote Play, even if I connect my PS5 Pro via Ethernet. Strangely enough, the PlayStation Portal is far more reliable at streaming games from servers thousands of miles away than it is remotely connecting to the console a few dozen feet away from me. That just goes to show how far cloud streaming has come — it practically feels like local gameplay now. I suppose that shouldn't be too surprising for Sony, since it's only pumping out 1080p streams. NVIDIA's GeForce Now has proven it's possible to stream PC games in 4K, so long as you have gobs of bandwidth to support it.The best thing I can say about the PlayStation Portal now is that I can finally trust it — up to a point, anyway. I had no trouble signing onto its streaming servers to play Ghost of Yotei and Spider-Man 2 on my home network, and I was also able to stream games while tethering on my phone. But the Portal remains a useless device if you're stuck somewhere without decent internet access. You can forget about using it on a plane, even with fast in-flight Wi-Fi, or at hotels with crummy internet and no cellular reception.Spider-Man 2 on the PlayStation PortalDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetGiven its need for decent connectivity and its clunky design, the PlayStation Portal also remains a terrible gaming option on the go. You'll need to find a large case to fit the Portal's huge controller and delicate display, a combination that really does look like a tablet shoved between Sony's DualSense gamepads. It's simply smarter to travel with the slimmer Switch 2, and I'd argue even the massive Steam Deck is easier to stuff into a backpack. And it’s worth noting you can also use apps on the Steam Deck to Remote Play from your console, and you can install the PlayStation Plus Windows app to stream games from the cloud.I'm also still annoyed that Sony didn't include Bluetooth connectivity in the Portal. If you want wireless audio, you'll either have to use Sony's Pulse Explore earbuds or Pulse Elite headphones. You'll have to plug in a separate Bluetooth receiver if you want to use AirPods or any other wireless headphones. You'll definitely want to invest in some sort of audio solution if you plan to game on the Portal for long sessions, since its tinny speakers simply can't do justice to Ghost of Yotei's immersive soundscape.Not surprisingly, cloud gaming didn’t change the Portal’s battery life much. I still saw between four and five hours of play time (broken into dad-friendly chunks, of course). And if you’re on some sort of marathon session, you can always plug in to charge. Since the Portal isn’t using any local hardware to power games — it’s really just decoding video and pushing data over its network connection — you can also expect more reliable battery life than other handhelds. The Switch 2, for example, could last between two to six hours, depending on what you’re playing.While I still can’t wholeheartedly recommend the PlayStation Portal to every gamer, its latest updates make it a more viable option for PlayStation diehards. Maybe you’ll have better luck with Remote Play than me. And if you’re already a PS Plus subscriber, it’s the easiest way to access Sony’s cloud infrastructure.

          "title": "The Morning After: Valve revives the Steam Machine",
          "standfirst": "Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. Steam Frame is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest. At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) Steam Machine. This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick. As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited I would be. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year.

          "content": "Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. Steam Frame is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest. At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) Steam Machine. This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick. As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited I would be. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year. On one hand, the performance promises laid out here are fairly substantial but, on the other, this is also a company that sells the base model Steam Deck for less than a Switch 2. That said, I would certainly get off the couch if there was a new Half-Life game in the works, and that seems plausible here.

          "standfirst": "If you’re travelling across the country or just heading to your local coffee shop to get some work done, a good power bank can come in handy. Perform a search for the term and you’ll be hit with an endless list of portable chargers, but not all of them are worth your money. I’ve tested dozens of batteries, seeing how fast they refill smartphones, tablets and laptops, and comparing how much they cost to how much charge they carry (and how nice they look). Here are the best power banks you can buy, with picks ranging from small MagSafe packs to massive laptop batteries and everything in between. Table of contents Best power banks for 2025 How we test best power banks What to look for in a portable battery pack Other power banks we tested Power bank FAQs Best power banks for 2025 What to look for in a portable battery pack Battery type Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). Flying with portable batteries You may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after just such a thing happened in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked. Recently, Southwest Airlines was the first in the industry to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category. Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is less efficient than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank. Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the Qi2 wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved. To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points. The MagSafe technology on iPhones were once the only handsets that were Qi2-compatible, but now Google’s Pixelsnap tech brings both the higher speed and magnetic grip to Pixel 10 phones. Samsung may follow up with its own version in future releases. The latest wireless charging standard, Q12 25W, is supported by the new iPhone 17 phones as well as the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. Battery packs that are Qi2 25W-enabled are starting to hit the market as well, and the Ugreen MagFlow was the first on the scene. Ports USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind). There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them). As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds. Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along. Design Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Here’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries: MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh) Low capacity (≤10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) InfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh) Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh) Belkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh) Anker Prime 26K 300W (26,250mAh) Biolite Charge 100 Max (25,000mAh) We're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary. For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used a 140W cable from Anker. For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15: 3,349 mAh iPhone 16: 3,561 Galaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air: 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank The Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank combines a 10K battery with a built-in USB-C cable and a pop-up Apple Watch charger. I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful. HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking. Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank Anker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports. EcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bank I was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered. Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category. Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is less efficient than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank. Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the Qi2 wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved. To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points. The MagSafe technology on iPhones were once the only handsets that were Qi2-compatible, but now Google’s Pixelsnap tech brings both the higher speed and magnetic grip to Pixel 10 phones. Samsung may follow up with its own version in future releases. The latest wireless charging standard, Q12 25W, is supported by the new iPhone 17 phones as well as the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. Battery packs that are Qi2 25W-enabled are starting to hit the market as well, and the Ugreen MagFlow was the first on the scene. Ports USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind). There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them). As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds. Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along. Design Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Here’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries: MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh) Low capacity (≤10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) InfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh) Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh) Belkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh) Anker Prime 26K 300W (26,250mAh) Biolite Charge 100 Max (25,000mAh) We're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary. For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used a 140W cable from Anker. For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15: 3,349 mAh iPhone 16: 3,561 Galaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air: 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank The Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank combines a 10K battery with a built-in USB-C cable and a pop-up Apple Watch charger. I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful. HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking. Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank Anker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports. EcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bank I was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered. Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

          "title": "OpenAI experiment finds that sparse models could give AI builders the tools to debug neural networks",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI researchers are experimenting with a new approach to designing neural networks, with the aim of making AI models easier to understand, debug, and govern. Sparse models can provide enterprises with a better understanding of how these models make decisions. Understanding how models choose to respond, a big selling point of reasoning models for enterprises, can provide a level of trust for organizations when they turn to AI models for insights. The method called for OpenAI scientists and researchers to look at and evaluate models not by analyzing post-training performance, but by adding interpretability or understanding through sparse circuits.OpenAI notes that much of the opacity of AI models stems from how most models are designed, so to gain a better understanding of model behavior, they must create workarounds. “Neural networks power today’s most capable AI systems, but they remain difficult to understand,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We don’t write these models with explicit step-by-step instructions. Instead, they learn by adjusting billions of internal connections or weights until they master a task. We design the rules of training, but not the specific behaviors that emerge, and the result is a dense web of connections that no human can easily decipher.”To enhance the interpretability of the mix, OpenAI examined an architecture that trains untangled neural networks, making them simpler to understand. The team trained language models with a similar architecture to existing models, such as GPT-2, using the same training schema. The result: improved interpretability. The path toward interpretabilityUnderstanding how models work, giving us insight into how they&#x27;re making their determinations, is important because these have a real-world impact, OpenAI says. The company defines interpretability as “methods that help us understand why a model produced a given output.” There are several ways to achieve interpretability: chain-of-thought interpretability, which reasoning models often leverage, and mechanistic interpretability, which involves reverse-engineering a model’s mathematical structure.OpenAI focused on improving mechanistic interpretability, which it said “has so far been less immediately useful, but in principle, could offer a more complete explanation of the model’s behavior.”“By seeking to explain model behavior at the most granular level, mechanistic interpretability can make fewer assumptions and give us more confidence. But the path from low-level details to explanations of complex behaviors is much longer and more difficult,” according to OpenAI. Better interpretability allows for better oversight and gives early warning signs if the model’s behavior no longer aligns with policy. OpenAI noted that improving mechanistic interpretability “is a very ambitious bet,” but research on sparse networks has improved this. How to untangle a model To untangle the mess of connections a model makes, OpenAI first cut most of these connections. Since transformer models like GPT-2 have thousands of connections, the team had to “zero out” these circuits. Each will only talk to a select number, so the connections become more orderly.Next, the team ran “circuit tracing” on tasks to create groupings of interpretable circuits. The last task involved pruning the model “to obtain the smallest circuit which achieves a target loss on the target distribution,” according to OpenAI. It targeted a loss of 0.15 to isolate the exact nodes and weights responsible for behaviors. “We show that pruning our weight-sparse models yields roughly 16-fold smaller circuits on our tasks than pruning dense models of comparable pretraining loss.

          "content": "OpenAI researchers are experimenting with a new approach to designing neural networks, with the aim of making AI models easier to understand, debug, and govern. Sparse models can provide enterprises with a better understanding of how these models make decisions. Understanding how models choose to respond, a big selling point of reasoning models for enterprises, can provide a level of trust for organizations when they turn to AI models for insights. The method called for OpenAI scientists and researchers to look at and evaluate models not by analyzing post-training performance, but by adding interpretability or understanding through sparse circuits.OpenAI notes that much of the opacity of AI models stems from how most models are designed, so to gain a better understanding of model behavior, they must create workarounds. “Neural networks power today’s most capable AI systems, but they remain difficult to understand,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “We don’t write these models with explicit step-by-step instructions. Instead, they learn by adjusting billions of internal connections or weights until they master a task. We design the rules of training, but not the specific behaviors that emerge, and the result is a dense web of connections that no human can easily decipher.”To enhance the interpretability of the mix, OpenAI examined an architecture that trains untangled neural networks, making them simpler to understand. The team trained language models with a similar architecture to existing models, such as GPT-2, using the same training schema. The result: improved interpretability. The path toward interpretabilityUnderstanding how models work, giving us insight into how they&#x27;re making their determinations, is important because these have a real-world impact, OpenAI says. The company defines interpretability as “methods that help us understand why a model produced a given output.” There are several ways to achieve interpretability: chain-of-thought interpretability, which reasoning models often leverage, and mechanistic interpretability, which involves reverse-engineering a model’s mathematical structure.OpenAI focused on improving mechanistic interpretability, which it said “has so far been less immediately useful, but in principle, could offer a more complete explanation of the model’s behavior.”“By seeking to explain model behavior at the most granular level, mechanistic interpretability can make fewer assumptions and give us more confidence. But the path from low-level details to explanations of complex behaviors is much longer and more difficult,” according to OpenAI. Better interpretability allows for better oversight and gives early warning signs if the model’s behavior no longer aligns with policy. OpenAI noted that improving mechanistic interpretability “is a very ambitious bet,” but research on sparse networks has improved this. How to untangle a model To untangle the mess of connections a model makes, OpenAI first cut most of these connections. Since transformer models like GPT-2 have thousands of connections, the team had to “zero out” these circuits. Each will only talk to a select number, so the connections become more orderly.Next, the team ran “circuit tracing” on tasks to create groupings of interpretable circuits. The last task involved pruning the model “to obtain the smallest circuit which achieves a target loss on the target distribution,” according to OpenAI. It targeted a loss of 0.15 to isolate the exact nodes and weights responsible for behaviors. “We show that pruning our weight-sparse models yields roughly 16-fold smaller circuits on our tasks than pruning dense models of comparable pretraining loss. We are also able to construct arbitrarily accurate circuits at the cost of more edges. This shows that circuits for simple behaviors are substantially more disentangled and localizable in weight-sparse models than dense models,” the report said. Small models become easier to trainAlthough OpenAI managed to create sparse models that are easier to understand, these remain significantly smaller than most foundation models used by enterprises. Enterprises increasingly use small models, but frontier models, such as its flagship GPT-5.1, will still benefit from improved interpretability down the line. Other model developers also aim to understand how their AI models think. Anthropic, which has been researching interpretability for some time, recently revealed that it had “hacked” Claude’s brain — and Claude noticed. Meta also is working to find out how reasoning models make their decisions.

          "title": "Baidu unveils proprietary ERNIE 5 beating GPT-5 performance on charts, document understanding and more",
          "standfirst": "Mere hours after OpenAI updated its flagship foundation model GPT-5 to GPT-5.1, promising reduced token usage overall and a more pleasant personality with more preset options, Chinese search giant Baidu unveiled its next-generation foundation model, ERNIE 5.0, alongside a suite of AI product upgrades and strategic international expansions.The goal: to position as a global contender in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.Announced at the company&#x27;s Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary, natively omni-modal model designed to jointly process and generate content across text, images, audio, and video. Unlike Baidu’s recently released ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking, which is open source under an enterprise-friendly and permissive Apache 2.0 license, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary model and is available only via Baidu’s ERNIE Bot website (I needed to select it manuallyu from the model picker dropdown) and the Qianfan cloud platform application programming interface (API) for enterprise customers. Alongside the model launch, Baidu introduced major updates to its digital human platform, no-code tools, and general-purpose AI agents — all targeted at expanding its AI footprint beyond China.The company also introduced ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022, a variant optimized for text-intensive tasks, alongside the general preview model that balances across modalities.Baidu emphasized that ERNIE 5.0 represents a shift in how intelligence is deployed at scale, with CEO Robin Li stating: “When you internalize AI, it becomes a native capability and transforms intelligence from a cost into a source of productivity.”Where ERNIE 5.0 outshines GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 ProERNIE 5.0’s benchmark results suggest that Baidu has achieved parity—or near-parity—with the top Western foundation models across a wide spectrum of tasks. In public benchmark slides shared during the Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 Preview outperformed or matched OpenAI’s GPT-5-High and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro in multimodal reasoning, document understanding, and image-based QA, while also demonstrating strong language modeling and code execution abilities. The company emphasized its ability to handle joint inputs and outputs across modalities, rather than relying on post-hoc modality fusion, which it framed as a technical differentiator.On visual tasks, ERNIE 5.0 achieved leading scores on OCRBench, DocVQA, and ChartQA, three benchmarks that test document recognition, comprehension, and structured data reasoning. Baidu claims the model beat both GPT-5-High and Gemini 2.5 Pro on these document and chart-based benchmarks, areas it describes as core to enterprise applications like automated document processing and financial analysis. In image generation, ERNIE 5.0 tied or exceeded Google’s Veo3 across categories including semantic alignment and image quality, according to Baidu’s internal GenEval-based evaluation. Baidu claimed that the model’s multimodal integration allows it to generate and interpret visual content with greater contextual awareness than models relying on modality-specific encoders.For audio and speech tasks, ERNIE 5.0 demonstrated competitive results on MM-AU and TUT2017 audio understanding benchmarks, as well as question answering from spoken language inputs. Its audio performance, while not as heavily emphasized as vision or text, suggests a broad capability footprint intended to support full-spectrum multimodal applications.In language tasks, the model showed strong results on instruction following, factual question answering, and mathematical reasoning—core areas that define the enterprise utility of large language models. The Preview 1022 variant of ERNIE 5.0, tailored for textual performance, showed even stronger language-specific results in early developer access. While Baidu does not claim broad superiority in general language reasoning, its internal evaluations suggest that ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022 closes the gap with top-tier English-language models and outperforms them in Chinese-language performance.While Baidu did not release full benchmark details or raw scores publicly, its performance positioning suggests a deliberate attempt to frame ERNIE 5.0 not as a niche multimodal system but as a flagship model competitive with the largest closed models in general-purpose reasoning. Where Baidu claims a clear lead is in structured document understanding, visual chart reasoning, and integration of multiple modalities into a single, native modeling architecture. Independent verification of these results remains pending, but the breadth of claimed capabilities positions ERNIE 5.0 as a serious alternative in the multimodal foundation model landscape.Enterprise Pricing StrategyERNIE 5.0 is positioned at the premium end of Baidu’s model pricing structure. The company has released specific pricing for API usage on its Qianfan platform, aligning the cost with other top-tier offerings from Chinese competitors like Alibaba.ModelInput Cost (per 1K tokens)Output Cost (per 1K tokens)SourceERNIE 5.0$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.00011 (¥0.0008)$0.00045 (¥0.0032)QianfanQwen3 (Coder ex.)$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanThe contrast in cost between ERNIE 5.0 and earlier models such as ERNIE 4.5 Turbo underscores Baidu’s strategy to differentiate between high-volume, low-cost models and high-capability models designed for complex tasks and multimodal reasoning.Compared to other U.S. alternatives, it remains mid-range in pricing:ModelInput (/1 M tokens)Output (/1 M tokens)SourceGPT-5.1$1.25$10.00OpenAIERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.11$0.45QianfanClaude Opus 4.1$15.00$75.00Anthropic Gemini 2.5 Pro$1.25 (≤200k) / $2.50 (>200k)$10.00 (≤200k) / $15.00 (>200k)Google Vertex AI PricingGrok 4 (grok-4-0709)$3.00$15.00 xAI APIGlobal Expansion: Products and PlatformsIn tandem with the model release, Baidu is expanding internationally:GenFlow 3.0, now with 20M+ users, is the company’s largest general-purpose AI agent and features enhanced memory and multimodal task handling.Famou, a self-evolving agent capable of dynamically solving complex problems, is now commercially available via invite.MeDo, the international version of Baidu’s no-code builder Miaoda, is live globally via medo.dev.Oreate, a productivity workspace with document, slide, image, video, and podcast support, has reached over 1.2M users worldwide.Baidu’s digital human platform, already rolled out in Brazil, is also part of the global push. According to company data, 83% of livestreamers during this year’s “Double 11” shopping event in China used Baidu’s digital human tech, contributing to a 91% increase in GMV.Meanwhile, Baidu’s autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go has surpassed 17 million rides, operating driverless fleets in 22 cities and claiming the title of the world’s largest robotaxi network.Open-Source Vision-Language Model Garners Industry AttentionTwo days before the flagship ERNIE 5.0 event, Baidu also released an open-source multimodal model under the Apache 2.0 license: ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking. As reported by my colleague Michael Nuñez at VentureBeat, the model activates just 3 billion parameters while maintaining a total of 28 billion, using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficient inference.Key technical innovations include:“Thinking with Images”, which enables dynamic zoom-based visual analysisSupport for chart interpretation, document understanding, visual grounding, and temporal awareness in videoRuntime on a single 80GB GPU, making it accessible to mid-sized organizationsFull compatibility with Transformers, vLLM, and Baidu’s FastDeploy toolkitsThis release adds pressure on closed-source competitors. With Apache 2.0 licensing, ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking becomes a viable foundation model for commercial applications without licensing restrictions — something few high-performing models in this class offer.Community Feedback and Baidu’s ResponseFollowing the launch of ERNIE 5.0, developer and AI evaluator Lisan al Gaib (@scaling01) posted a mixed review on X. While initially impressed by the model’s benchmark performance, they reported a persistent issue where ERNIE 5.0 would repeatedly invoke tools — even when explicitly instructed not to — during SVG generation tasks.“ERNIE 5.0 benchmarks looked insane until I tested it… unfortunately it’s RL braindamaged or they have a serious issue with their chat platform / system prompt,” Lisan wrote.In a matter of hours, Baidu’s developer-focused support account, @ErnieforDevs, responded:“Thanks for the feedback! It’s a known bug — certain syntax can consistently trigger it. We’re working on a fix. You can try rephrasing or changing the prompt to avoid it for now.”The quick turnaround reflects Baidu’s increasing emphasis on developer communication, especially as it courts international users through both proprietary and open-source offerings.Outlook for Baidu and its ERNIE foundational LLM familyBaidu’s ERNIE 5.0 marks a strategic escalation in the global foundation model race. With performance claims that put it on par with the most advanced systems from OpenAI and Google, and a mix of premium pricing and open-access alternatives, Baidu is signaling its ambition to become not just a domestic AI leader, but a credible global infrastructure provider.At a time when enterprise AI users are increasingly demanding multimodal performance, flexible licensing, and deployment efficiency, Baidu’s two-track approach—premium hosted APIs and open-source releases—may broaden its appeal across both corporate and developer communities.Whether the company’s performance claims hold up under third-party testing remains to be seen. But in a landscape shaped by rising costs, model complexity, and compute bottlenecks, ERNIE 5.0 and its supporting ecosystem give Baidu a competitive position in the next wave of AI deployment.",

Sternberg, a fossil collector. The skeleton, later housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and nicknamed the “AMNH mummy,” was covered by scaly skin imprinted in the surrounding sediment that gave us the first approximate idea of what the animal looked like. More than a century later, a team of paleontologists led by Paul C. Sereno, a professor of organismal biology at the University of Chicago, got back to the same exact place where Sternberg dug up the first Edmontosaurus specimen. The researchers found two more Edmontosaurus mummies with all fleshy external anatomy imprinted in a sub-millimeter layer of clay. For the first time, we uncovered an accurate image of what Edmontosaurus really looked like, down to the tiniest details, like the size of its scales and the arrangement of spikes on its tail. And we were in for at least a few surprises. Evolving images Our view of Edmontosaurus changed over time, even before Sereno’s study. The initial drawing of Edmontosaurus was made in 1909 by Charles R. Knight, a famous paleoartist, who based his visualization on the first specimen found by Sternberg. “He was accurate in some ways, but he made a mistake in that he drew the crest extending throughout the entire length of the body,” Sereno says. The mummy Knight based his drawing on had no tail, so understandably, the artist used his imagination to fill in the gaps and made the Edmontosaurus look a little bit like a dragon.Read full article Comments",

And the longer the verdict is delayed, the higher the refunds could go, possibly even hitting $1 trillion. For tech companies both large and small, the stakes are particularly high. A Trump defeat would not just mean clawing back any duties paid on imports to the US that companies otherwise can use to invest in their competitiveness. But, more critically in the long term, it would also end tariff shocks that, as economics lecturer Matthew Allen emphasized in a report for The Conversation, risked harming “innovation itself” by destabilizing global partnerships and diverse supply chains in “tech-intensive, IP-led sectors like semiconductors and software.” Currently, the Supreme Court is weighing two cases that argue that the US president does not have unilateral authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Defending his regime of so-called “reciprocal tariffs,” Trump argued these taxes were necessary to correct the “emergency” of enduring trade imbalances that he alleged have unfairly enriched other countries while bringing the US “to the brink of catastrophic decline.”Read full article Comments",

OK, we’re not talking about a major international airport (although I really need to talk to someone at Dulles International Airport about my idea to electrify those Space 1999-esque mobile lounges at some point). But up in Humboldt County, California, there’s a microgrid at the Redwood Coast Airport that has now integrated bidirectional charging, and a pair of Nissan Leaf EVs, into its operation. The microgrid has been operating since 2021 with a 2.2 MW solar array, 8.9 MWh of battery storage, and a 300 KW net-metered solar system. It can feed excess power back into PG&E’s local grid and draw power from the same, but in an outage, the microgrid can keep the airport up and operational.Read full article Comments",

The panel—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—is typically composed of preeminent, extensively vetted vaccine experts.

In a nutshell, the Rebelle Rally is the longest competitive off-road rally in the United States, covering over 2,000 kilometers, and it just happens to be for women. Over eight days, teams of two must plot coordinates on a map, figure out their route, and find multiple checkpoints—both marked and unmarked—with no GPS, cell phones, or chase crews. It is not a race for speed but rather a rally for navigational accuracy over some of the toughest terrain California and Nevada have to offer. There are two classes: 4×4 with vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco and X-Cross for cars like the Honda Passport and BMW X5. Heavy modifications aren’t needed, and many teams compete for the coveted Bone Stock award.

Commander Chen Dong, concluding his third trip to space, and rookie crewmates Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie touched down inside their spacecraft at the Dongfeng landing zone at 1:29 am EST (06:29 UTC) Friday. The parachute-assisted landing occurred in the mid-afternoon at the return zone, located in the remote Gobi Desert of northwestern China. Chinese space officials upended operations on the country’s Tiangong space lab last week after astronauts found damage to one of two Shenzhou return capsules docked at the station. The China Manned Space Agency, run by the country’s military, announced changes to the space station’s flight plan November 4, the day before three crew members were supposed to depart and fly home.Read full article Comments",

The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too. On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote. The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.Read full article Comments",

The hunters soon handed it over to scientists, who were excited to see its exquisite level of preservation, with skin, muscle tissue, and even reddish hair intact. Later research showed that, while full cloning was impossible, Yuka’s DNA was in such good condition that some cell nuclei could even begin limited activity when placed inside mouse eggs. Now, a team has successfully sequenced Yuka’s RNA—a feat many researchers once thought impossible. Researchers at Stockholm University carefully ground up bits of muscle and other tissue from Yuka and nine other woolly mammoths, then used special chemical treatments to pull out any remaining RNA fragments, which are normally thought to be much too fragile to survive even a few hours after an organism has died. Scientists go to great lengths to extract RNA even from fresh samples, and most previous attempts with very old specimens have either failed or been contaminated. A different view The team used RNA-handling methods adapted for ancient, fragmented molecules. Their scientific séance allowed them to explore information that had never been accessible before, including which genes were active when Yuka died. In the creature’s final panicked moments, its muscles were tensing and its cells were signaling distress—perhaps unsurprising since Yuka is thought to have died as a result of a cave lion attack.Read full article Comments",

In September, the reports said, Anthropic discovered a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign,” carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored group, that used Claude Code to automate up to 90 percent of the work. Human intervention was required “only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign).” Anthropic said the hackers had employed AI agentic capabilities to an “unprecedented” extent. “This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI ‘agents’—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention,” Anthropic said. “Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.”Read full article Comments",

A recent study of dog and wolf skulls from the last 50,000 years found that dogs living just after the last Ice Age were already about half as varied in their shape and size as modern dogs. “Shaped like a friend” means a lot of different things Biologist and archaeologist Allowen Evin, of CNRS, and her colleagues compared the size and shape of 643 skulls from dogs and wolves: 158 from modern dogs, 86 from modern wolves, and 391 from archaeological sites around the world spanning the last 50,000 years. By comparing the locations and sizes of certain skeletal landmarks, such as bony protrusions where muscles attached, the researchers could quantify how different one skull was from another. That suggested a few things about how dogs, or at least the shapes of their heads, have evolved over time. The team’s results suggest that dogs that lived during the Mesolithic (before settled farming life came into fashion in the Middle East) and the Neolithic (after farming took off but before the heyday of copper smelting; 10,000 BCE is a general starting point) were a surprisingly diverse bunch, at least in terms of the size and shape of their skulls.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Back in 2012, Dishonored earned the first Game of the Year honor of my tenure at Ars Technica. Looking back on the game some 13 years later, Arkane’s well-constructed world of steam punk magical realism earns its place as a modern classic. The game does a great job of drawing you into that world immediately, with a memorable opening sequence that sees you framed for the on-screen murder of the empress you’ve been sworn to protect. The scene does a great job establishing the emotional stakes of the coming missions while also throwing you into the deep end of the political infighting that has consumed a besieged, plague-beset kingdom. A Victorian steam punk world you can lose yourself in. Credit: Arkane Studios Those stakes, and a battle against a real feeling of injustice, drive the plot through some admittedly predictable beats as Dishonored continues through a set of sneak-and-assassinate missions. But it’s hard to care about that predictability when even minor side characters on both sides of the conflict quickly develop from stereotypes to engaging, fleshed-out characters.Read full article Comments",

Thursday was a monumental day in launch history with Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket not just taking off successfully, but with the first stage masterfully returning to the surface of the ocean, hovering near the Jacklyn drone ship, and then making a landing in the center of the barge. It was fantastic to watch and cements our new reality of reusable rockets. The future of space access is very bright indeed.

Galactic Energy’s solid-fuel Ceres-1 rocket lifted off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Sunday, carrying three satellites toward low-Earth orbit. The rocket’s first three stages performed well, according to media reports, but its fourth and final stage shut down too early, leading to the loss of all three payloads, Space.com reports.Read full article Comments",

The bleak outlook is driven by a new strain of H3N2, which emerged over the summer (at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s season) sporting several mutations. Those changes are not enough to spark the direst of circumstances—a deadly pandemic—but they could help the virus dodge immune responses, resulting in an outsize number of severe illnesses that could put a significant strain on hospitals and clinics. In the UK, the virus has taken off. The region’s flu season has started around five weeks earlier than normal and is making a swift ascent.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "If you ask random gamers what price they think Valve will charge for its newly announced Steam Machine hardware, you’ll get a wide range of guesses. But if you ask the analysts who follow the game industry for a living the same question… well, you’ll actually get the same wide range of (somewhat better-informed) guesses. At the high end of those guesses are analysts like F-Squared‘s Michael Futter, who expects a starting price of $799 to $899 for the entry-level 512GB Steam Machine and a whopping $1,000 to $1,100 for the 2TB version. With internal specs that Futter says “will rival a PS5 and maybe even hit PS5 Pro performance,” we can expect a “hefty price tag” from Valve’s new console-like effort. At the same time, since Valve is “positioning this as a dedicated, powerful gaming PC… I suspect that the price will be below a similarly capable traditional desktop,” Futter said. DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole similarly expects the Steam Machine to start at a price “around $800” and go up to “around $1,000” for the 2TB model. Cole said he expects Valve will seek “very low margins” or even break-even pricing on the hardware itself, which he said would probably lead to pricing “below a gaming PC but slightly above a high-end console.”Read full article Comments",
