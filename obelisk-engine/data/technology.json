Right now Spotify integration is only available on the djay desktop apps. Neither company has commented on the possibility of the feature coming to the mobile apps. When I started DJing at my local community streaming radio station, I relied on a combination of Spotify and Algoriddim’s djay. But, back in 2020 Spotify unceremoniously decided to kill off that integration, reportedly due to licensing issues. The company’s Terms of Service expressly forbid the mixing of Spotify songs. I guess those roadblocks have been sorted out, though, because Spotify is back in the djay app. Thankfully you can enjoy integration even with the free version of the djay app, though paying for a Pro subscription does add hardware integration, some effects, and other features that will be appreciated by more serious DJs. In the years since Spotify pulled support, Algoriddim continued to integrate with Tidal and SoundCloud, and added support for Apple Music. If you were using djay to, you know, DJ, in any serious capacity, chances are that you’ve already jumped to one of those services.",

          "content": "The solar cell does not light up, contrary to Logitech’s marketing images for the K980. | Image: Logitech Logitech left solar-powered keyboards in the dark for over a decade, but it’s launching a new one today. Just like the K760 before it, its new $99.99 Signature Slim Solar Plus K980 can only be powered with light. There’s no USB port or swappable batteries. Instead, it features a cell that can convert solar or artificial light — 200 lux at minimum — into power to charge its battery, which the company says will last for up to 10 years. Once fully charged, the company says the K980 can be used in complete darkness for up to four months. I asked Logitech if the K980’s battery is user-replaceable, and spokesperson Melvin Dilanchian told The Verge that it is “safely user-replaceable (because it’s encased in a plastic casing), with spare parts supplied by iFixIt.” Beyond its solar charging capabilities, the K980 has a pretty standard full-size layout, with Windows and macOS key labels, directional keys, and a numpad. Its function row is pre-programmed to control media, screen brightness, and volume, although you can customize their secondary features (or turn off secondary features altogether) in the Logi Options Plus app for Mac or Windows. The K980 also includes a mic mute key, a camera on/off toggle, and an Action key along the top row that can be programmed however you’d prefer in the app. It also features a new addition: an AI Launch key. The AI key is what you think it is; it defaults on Windows PCs to launching Copilot (ChromeOS defaults to Gemini), though it can be customized in Logitech’s app to open ChatGPT or an AI prompt builder. Alternatively, you can assign one of Logitech’s Smart Actions to the key to, say, ask Perplexity for an answer to your query in your browser. Or, you can just set it to be right CTRL. The Action Key (the key on the top row that looks like a big O) and several others can be programmed to execute these macros, too, whether you use one of Logitech’s presets or create your own through the app. The graphite-colored version of the K980 is universal (see full image), with key labels for Windows and macOS. However, Mac users in North America can opt for the off-white model that gets rid of Windows labels for the same price (see full image). The K980 supports being paired with up to three Bluetooth devices, letting you swap between them with a press of a button. It can also be connected to a computer that has a Logitech Bolt USB transmitter, although one isn’t included in the box (would have been nice!). A previous Logitech model had playful built-in LED indicators that would warn you when the ambient light wasn’t sufficient to charge the keyboard, but the K980’s power LED simply turns from green to red if it needs more charge. This is how Logitech gets you to install its Options Plus app. The app has an indicator that says whether there’s enough light. 2025 seems to be the year when companies decided the sun was cool again, as Lenovo recently launched the $99.99 self-charging wireless keyboard that it first showed off in January at CES 2025. I think I dig it more than the K980, although I haven’t tried it yet and it doesn’t seem to include as much in the way of customization. Still, it has things that I like in a keyboard that the K980 lacks, like adjustable legs that can give it some tilt and a spill-resistant design. Plus, it has a USB-C charging port, just in case.",

Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration. Alphabet made this announcement via a lengthy letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube. For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it \"appreciates the accountability\" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking.

Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, IT: Welcome to Derry, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut. (Some spoilers below for IT and IT: Chapter Two.) As previously reported, set in 1989, IT essentially adapted half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves \"The Losers Club.\" The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.Read full article Comments",

They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it. New research released earlier this month titled \"We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof\" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3. A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces \"TAAROFBENCH,\" the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.Read full article Comments",

In 2008, when Apple took the very first MacBook Air out of a manila envelope, it was not positioned as Apple's new entry-level Mac laptop. The innovative but flawed system started at $1,799, far above the $999 price of the entry-level plastic MacBook and well into MacBook Pro territory. In those early, formative years, the \"Air\" branding denoted not a midrange or entry-level model but an alternate branching path from the baseline MacBook. Paying Apple more money could get you more computer—the Pro model, with more processor, more screen, more storage, more everything—or it could get you a different kind of computer, with fundamentally different benefits and trade-offs.Read full article Comments",

I saw there's a letter from some Senate Democrats that said the FCC threatened to revoke the license of Disney and ABC if they didn't fire Jimmy Kimmel, and that did not happen in any way, shape, or form.\" While Carr complained that Democrats interpreted his comments as a threat to Disney, he didn't mention that his comments were also interpreted as a threat by several prominent Senate Republicans. Disney suspended Kimmel's show last week after Carr said ABC affiliates could have licenses revoked for \"news distortion,\" but reinstated Kimmel yesterday after facing backlash from the public. Kimmel will be back on the air on many ABC-affiliated stations, but not those run by Nexstar and Sinclair, which have replaced Jimmy Kimmel Live! with news and other programming.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It's a rare occurrence for scientists to witness sharks mating in the wild. It's even rarer to catch three leopard sharks—two males and one female—engaging in what amounts to a threesome in the wild on camera, particularly since they are considered an endangered species. But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in a paper published in the Journal of Ethology. It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now. Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.Read full article Comments",

While the preliminary injunction can still be appealed, the project is already 80 percent complete, so construction could potentially wrap up while the case is still pending. The Trump administration has made no secret of its animosity toward renewable power and issued early executive orders that blocked further offshore leases and re-evaluated the permitting process for others. But it has also gone beyond that and issued stop-work orders for sites that had already been through the permitting process and were under construction. Its reasons for doing so have been remarkably vague, with suggestions of unspecified flaws to the permitting process that involve everything from environmental impacts to detail-free national security concerns. But those reasons could apparently be ignored under the right circumstances. After blocking further construction of New York's Empire Wind, the administration lifted the block without explaining why its supposed reasons for instituting it no longer applied.Read full article Comments",

The director requested anonymity for themself and the district out of concern about potential blowback. The director confirmed that the district has five schools and about 3,000 students.

Volvo has been making cars in South Carolina since 2017, starting with the S60 sedan—a decision I always found slightly curious given that US car buyers had already given up on sedans by that point in favor of crossovers and SUVs. S60 production ended last summer, and these days, the plant builds the large electric EX90 SUV and the related Polestar 3. The company is far from fully utilizing the Ridgeville plant, though, which has an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles. When the turnaround plan was first announced this July, Volvo revealed it would start building the next midsize XC60 in South Carolina—a wise move given the Trump tariffs and the importance of this model to Volvo's sales figures here.Read full article Comments",
