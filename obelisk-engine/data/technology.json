          "content": "Bluesky will block access from Mississippi IP addresses in response to a new state law requiring age verification and parental consent for underage users. The decision, outlined in a blog post, will stand until courts decide the fate of the law. “Mississippi&#8217;s approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky,” says the post, in ways that rules like the UK’s Online Safety Act (which Bluesky complies with) don’t. The law, HB 1126, “would block everyone from accessing the site — teens and adults — unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.” In the UK, by contrast, users are only blocked from accessing direct messages and sensitive content unless they undergo a verification process using a third-party tool. “Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law&#8217;s broad scope and privacy implications.” HB 1126 is one of numerous attempts to age-gate social media in the US, but most similar laws have been blocked under court challenges as likely unconstitutional. HB 1126 went into effect thanks to an unexplained decision by the Supreme Court earlier this month, rejecting an emergency request to block it while a legal challenge progresses. A concurring opinion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh acknowledged that the law probably violated the First Amendment but said the plaintiffs had not sufficiently demonstrated harms. While the court has said that age verification can be used to block minors from accessing explicit sexual content without unduly burdening adults’ access to information, there’s no precedent extending that option to social media in general. Now, however, Bluesky users who log in from inside the borders of Mississippi (without a VPN, anyway) will be met with a message explaining the decision. The decision applies specifically to the Bluesky app; other apps and services on the decentralized AT Protocol will make their own calls about access. “Child safety is a core priority, and in this evolving regulatory landscape, we remain committed to building an open social ecosystem that protects users while preserving choice and innovation,” the post says. “We’ll keep you updated as this situation develops.”",

          "content": "Meta is partnering with Midjourney to “license their aesthetic technology” for use in its own models and products, Meta’s new chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, announced on Friday. The partnership involves a “technical collaboration between our research teams,” Wang said, suggesting the deal involves more than simply using Midjourney’s existing product across Meta services. Wang didn’t specify the terms of arrangement. Meta spokesperson Ashley Gabriel declined to comment and pointed to Wang’s posts. Midjourney didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment. Meta has been investing heavily in its AI “superintelligence” efforts as of late to catch up to rivals like OpenAI and Google. Mark Zuckerberg has personally worked to poach AI researchers from other companies with humongous offers — Wang only joined Meta after it paid $14.3 billion to acquire 49 percent of Scale AI, the company he co-founded. The partnership with Midjourney ties directly into Meta’s goals for AI imagery across its services. The Meta AI app is built around a feed of AI-generated images and videos. Facebook has added a button to create AI images when you go to make a new post. There are options to generate AI images within chats in WhatsApp and Instagram, too. Midjourney got on the map for its AI image and video generation tools. As Meta works to build out features like the Meta AI app’s social feed, it’s easy to imagine Meta relying on Midjourney’s tech to help people make better-looking photos and videos. “We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney,” Wang says. “They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them.” The two companies will share more about what they’re working on together “soon.” Even with the partnership, Midjourney remains “an independent, community-backed research lab” with “no investors,” founder and CEO David Holz says.",

Grigorian wants to capture an authentic Victorian voice in the AI model's outputs. As a result, the AI model ends up spitting out text that's heavy with biblical references and period-appropriate rhetorical excess.Read full article Comments",

The four cases were tied together not just by their shared location but also by the bacterial strain; whole genome sequencing showed the bacteria causing all four infections were highly related, suggesting a shared source of their infections. But this bacterium doesn't tend to jump from person to person. And none of the men had recent travel that explained the infection. In fact, only one of the men had ever been to a place where the bacterium lives, but it was decades before his infection. And there's another twist: The four infections spanned decades. The first occurred in 1983, the second in 1989, and the last two occurred a day apart in September 2024. In a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases, state and federal health researchers suggest that the four linked cases indicate that the dangerous bacterium—Burkholderia pseudomallei—has been lurking in the Georgia area the entire time.

That comes after decades of essentially flat use, a change that has been associated with a rapid expansion of data centers. And a lot of those data centers are being built to serve the boom in AI usage. Given that some of this rising demand is being met by increased coal use (as of May, coal's share of generation is up about 20 percent compared to the year prior), the environmental impact of AI is looking pretty bad. But it's difficult to know for certain without access to the sorts of details that you'd only get by running a data center, such as how often the hardware is in use, and how often it's serving AI queries. So, while academics can test the power needs of individual AI models, it's hard to extrapolate that to real-world use cases. By contrast, Google has all sorts of data available from real-world use cases. As such, its release of a new analysis of AI's environmental impact is a rare opportunity to peer a tiny bit under the hood. But the new analysis suggests that energy estimates are currently a moving target, as the company says its data shows the energy drain of a search has dropped by a factor of 33 in just the past year.Read full article Comments",

So, Pallarés and his team spent the past 10 years researching the neural mechanisms behind a condition they called specific musical anhedonia: the inability to enjoy music. The wiring behind joy When we like something, it is usually a joint effect of circuits in our brain responsible for perception—be it perception of taste, touch, or sound—and reward circuits that give us a shot of dopamine in response to nice things we experience. For a long time, scientists attributed a lack of pleasure from things most people find enjoyable to malfunctions in one or more of those circuits.Read full article Comments",

The Republican-led FTC's determined to keep pressure on the nonprofit—which is dedicated to monitoring conservative misinformation—ever since Elon Musk villainized MMFA in 2023 for reporting that ads were appearing next to pro-Nazi posts on X. Musk claims that reporting caused so many brands to halt advertising that X's revenue dropped by $1.5 billion, but advertisers have suggested there technically was no boycott. They've said that many factors influenced each of their independent decisions to leave X—including their concerns about Musk's own antisemitic post, which drew rebuke from the White House in 2023. In the time since, the toxic content has started coming from within X, via backlash-inducing outputs from its chatbot Grok. For MMFA, advertisers, agencies, and critics, a big question remains: Can the FTC actually penalize advertisers for invoking their own rights to free expression and association by refusing to deal with a private company just because they happened to agree on a collective set of brand standards to avoid monetizing hate speech or offensive content online?Read full article Comments",

This endangers various marine species, and monitoring those changes is vitally important. But it can be challenging to reach the deepest waters without the aid of very expensive equipment. Moon jellyfish can swim to those depths, however, making them a potential ally in the quest to study the deep ocean. That's why researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder) have built \"cyborg\" jellyfish equipped with tiny microelectronics devices, with the aim of gathering critical data on temperature, acidity, and other relevant properties. To further improve their hybrid creations, the team has been studying the biomechanics of how jellyfish swim. Their research also involves analyzing water flow patterns generated by swimming jellies using suspended starchy biodegradable particles, described in the group's most recent paper published in the journal Physical Review Fluids. Creating biohybrid creatures is a well-established field. For instance, as we previously reported, scientists have been intrigued by the potential of cyborg insects since the 1990s, when researchers began implanting tiny electrodes into cockroach antennae and shocking them to direct their movements. The idea was to use them as hybrid robots for search-and-rescue applications.Read full article Comments",

ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, New Jersey—Micro LED is still years away, but the next best thing is taking shape right now. A $30,000 price tag and 114.5-inch diagonal size makes the Samsung \"Micro RGB\" TV that I demoed this week unattainable for most. But the unique RGB backlight and Micro LED-sized diodes it employs represent a groundbreaking middle ground between high-end Mini LED and true Micro LED, expanding the possibilities for future premium displays beyond the acronyms we know today. Micro RGB isn’t the same as Micro LED To be clear, Samsung's Micro RGB TV is not a Micro LED display. During Samsung's presentation, a representative described the TV as sitting \"squarely in between\" Mini LED and Micro LED. Unlike true Micro LED TVs, Samsung's Micro RGB TV uses a backlight. The backlight is unique in that it can produce red, green, and/or blue light via tiny RGB LEDs. Most LCD-LED backlights create just blue or white backlighting, which is applied to color filters to create the different hues displayed on the screen.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "There are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about electric vehicle adoption here in the US. The current administration has made no secret of its hostility toward EVs and, as promised, has ended as many of the existing EV subsidies and vehicle pollution regulations as it could. After more than a year of month-on-month growth, EV sales started to contract, and brands like Genesis and Volvo have seen their customers reject their electric offerings, forcing portfolio rethinks. But wait, it gets worse. Time and again, surveys and studies show that fears and concerns about charging are the main barriers standing in the way of someone switching from gas to EV. A new market research study by Telemetry Vice President Sam Abuelsamid confirms this, as it analyzes the charging infrastructure needs over the next decade. And one of the biggest hurdles—one that has gone mostly unmentioned across the decade-plus we've been covering this topic—is all the junk clogging up Americans' garages. Want an EV? Clean out your garage That's because, while DC fast-charging garners all the headlines and much of the funding, the overwhelming majority of EV charging is AC charging, usually at home—80 percent of it, in fact. People who own and live in a single family home are overrepresented among EV owners, and data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from a few years ago found that 42 percent of homeowners park near an electrical outlet capable of level 2 (240 V) AC charging.Read full article Comments",

A few years ago, many of the new cars debuting during Car Week focused on outright speed and performance above all else, relying on electric powertrains to deliver physics-defying acceleration and ballistic speed.

These terminations were challenged in court, and a consolidated case was heard in the District of Massachusetts, pitting the government against individual researchers, organizations that represent them, and states that host research institutions. The result was a decisive win for the scientists. As the ruling explained, the government's termination efforts violated a statute against \"arbitrary and capricious\" policies, resulting in a stay that both blocked implementation of the policy and restored the flow of research funding. That stay remained intact through appeals that brought it to the Supreme Court, which released its ruling on Thursday. As the result is a complicated split among the Justices, the stay against the policy itself remains intact. However, a slim majority decided that government funding issues are required to be heard by a different court and cannot be issued as part of the same ruling. So, researchers who lost their funding due to the now-defunct policy will remain de-funded.Read full article Comments",

The findings challenge conventional interpretations of prehistoric violence as bring indiscriminate or committed for pragmatic reasons. Neolithic Europe was no stranger to collective violence of many forms, such as the odd execution and massacres of small communities, as well as armed conflicts. For instance, we recently reported on an analysis of human remains from 11 individuals recovered from El Mirador Cave in Spain, showing evidence of cannibalism—likely the result of a violent episode between competing Late Neolithic herding communities about 5,700 years ago. Microscopy analysis revealed telltale slice marks, scrape marks, and chop marks, as well as evidence of cremation, peeling, fractures, and human tooth marks. This indicates the victims were skinned, the flesh removed, the bodies disarticulated, and then cooked and eaten. Isotope analysis indicated the individuals were local and were probably eaten over the course of just a few days. There have been similar Neolithic massacres in Germany and Spain, but the El Mirador remains provide evidence of a rare systematic consumption of victims.Read full article Comments",

When the Trump administration announced its overhaul of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in March, estimates published by The Wall Street Journal suggested that SpaceX could receive $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules. Musk clearly expected a big windfall; as we've written, SpaceX alleges that Virginia and Louisiana violated the Trump administration's rules by allocating most of the money to fiber providers instead of Starlink's satellite service. Assuming Virginia and Louisiana don't back down, SpaceX has indicated it will ask the Trump administration to reject their grant proposals. SpaceX might end up filing similar objections in many other states after more of them reveal their plans. A third state, West Virginia, revealed its plan on Tuesday, and SpaceX isn't likely to be happy with it.Read full article Comments",
