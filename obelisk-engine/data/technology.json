The 128GB Meta Quest 3S is 17 percent off in an early Black Friday deal, bringing it to a record-low price of $250. It normally goes for $300. With the purchase, you also get the game Gorilla Tag for free. There's also a 256GB option, which is on sale as well and comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow. That version costs $330, down from its usual price of $400. The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a 90 in Engadget's review, landing it among our picks for the best VR headsets around right now. It's comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn't quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM. The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience.

          "title": "From shiny object to sober reality: The vector database story, two years later",
          "standfirst": "When I first wrote “Vector databases: Shiny object syndrome and the case of a missing unicorn” in March 2024, the industry was awash in hype. Vector databases were positioned as the next big thing — a must-have infrastructure layer for the gen AI era. Billions of venture dollars flowed, developers rushed to integrate embeddings into their pipelines and analysts breathlessly tracked funding rounds for Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus and a dozen others.The promise was intoxicating: Finally, a way to search by meaning rather than by brittle keywords. Just dump your enterprise knowledge into a vector store, connect an LLM and watch magic happen.Except the magic never fully materialized.Two years on, the reality check has arrived: 95% of organizations invested in gen AI initiatives are seeing zero measurable returns. And, many of the warnings I raised back then — about the limits of vectors, the crowded vendor landscape and the risks of treating vector databases as silver bullets — have played out almost exactly as predicted.Prediction 1: The missing unicornBack then, I questioned whether Pinecone — the poster child of the category — would achieve unicorn status or whether it would become the “missing unicorn” of the database world. Today, that question has been answered in the most telling way possible: Pinecone is reportedly exploring a sale, struggling to break out amid fierce competition and customer churn.Yes, Pinecone raised big rounds and signed marquee logos. But in practice, differentiation was thin. Open-source players like Milvus, Qdrant and Chroma undercut them on cost. Incumbents like Postgres (with pgVector) and Elasticsearch simply added vector support as a feature. And customers increasingly asked: “Why introduce a whole new database when my existing stack already does vectors well enough?”The result: Pinecone, once valued near a billion dollars, is now looking for a home. The missing unicorn indeed. In September 2025, Pinecone appointed Ash Ashutosh as CEO, with founder Edo Liberty moving to a chief scientist role. The timing is telling: The leadership change comes amid increasing pressure and questions over its long-term independence. Prediction 2: Vectors alone won’t cut itI also argued that vector databases by themselves were not an end solution. If your use case required exactness — l ike searching for “Error 221” in a manual—a pure vector search would gleefully serve up “Error 222” as “close enough.” Cute in a demo, catastrophic in production.That tension between similarity and relevance has proven fatal to the myth of vector databases as all-purpose engines. “Enterprises discovered the hard way that semantic ≠ correct.”Developers who gleefully swapped out lexical search for vectors quickly reintroduced… lexical search in conjunction with vectors. Teams that expected vectors to “just work” ended up bolting on metadata filtering, rerankers and hand-tuned rules. By 2025, the consensus is clear: Vectors are powerful, but only as part of a hybrid stack.Prediction 3: A crowded field becomes commoditizedThe explosion of vector database startups was never sustainable. Weaviate, Milvus (via Zilliz), Chroma, Vespa, Qdrant — each claimed subtle differentiators, but to most buyers they all did the same thing: store vectors and retrieve nearest neighbors.Today, very few of these players are breaking out. The market has fragmented, commoditized and in many ways been swallowed by incumbents. Vector search is now a checkbox feature in cloud data platforms, not a standalone moat.Just as I wrote then: Distinguishing one vector DB from another will pose an increasing challenge. That challenge has only grown harder. Vald, Marqo, LanceDB, PostgresSQL, MySQL HeatWave, Oracle 23c, Azure SQL, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, SingleStore, ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, Apahce Solr… the list goes on.The new reality: Hybrid and GraphRAGBut this isn’t just a story of decline — it’s a story of evolution. Out of the ashes of vector hype, new paradigms are emerging that combine the best of multiple approaches.Hybrid Search: Keyword + vector is now the default for serious applications. Companies learned that you need both precision and fuzziness, exactness and semantics. Tools like Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, pgVector and Pinecone’s own “cascading retrieval” embrace this.GraphRAG: The hottest buzzword of late 2024/2025 is GraphRAG — graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation. By marrying vectors with knowledge graphs, GraphRAG encodes the relationships between entities that embeddings alone flatten away. The payoff is dramatic.Benchmarks and evidenceAmazon’s AI blog cites benchmarks from Lettria, where hybrid GraphRAG boosted answer correctness from ~50% to 80%-plus in test datasets across finance, healthcare, industry, and law. The GraphRAG-Bench benchmark (released May 2025) provides a rigorous evaluation of GraphRAG vs. vanilla RAG across reasoning tasks, multi-hop queries and domain challenges. An OpenReview evaluation of RAG vs GraphRAG found that each approach has strengths depending on task — but hybrid combinations often perform best. FalkorDB’s blog reports that when schema precision matters (structured domains), GraphRAG can outperform vector retrieval by a factor of ~3.4x on certain benchmarks. The rise of GraphRAG underscores the larger point: Retrieval is not about any single shiny object. It’s about building retrieval systems — layered, hybrid, context-aware pipelines that give LLMs the right information, with the right precision, at the right time.What this means going forwardThe verdict is in: Vector databases were never the miracle. They were a step — an important one — in the evolution of search and retrieval. But they are not, and never were, the endgame.The winners in this space won’t be those who sell vectors as a standalone database. They will be the ones who embed vector search into broader ecosystems — integrating graphs, metadata, rules and context engineering into cohesive platforms.In other words: The unicorn isn’t the vector database. The unicorn is the retrieval stack.Looking ahead: What’s nextUnified data platforms will subsume vector + graph: Expect major DB and cloud vendors to offer integrated retrieval stacks (vector + graph + full-text) as built-in capabilities.“Retrieval engineering” will emerge as a distinct discipline: Just as MLOps matured, so too will practices around embedding tuning, hybrid ranking and graph construction.Meta-models learning to query better: Future LLMs may learn to orchestrate which retrieval method to use per query, dynamically adjusting weighting.Temporal and multimodal GraphRAG: Already, researchers are extending GraphRAG to be time-aware (T-GRAG) and multimodally unified (e.g. connecting images, text, video).Open benchmarks and abstraction layers: Tools like BenchmarkQED (for RAG benchmarking) and GraphRAG-Bench will push the community toward fairer, comparably measured systems.From shiny objects to essential infrastructureThe arc of the vector database story has followed a classic path: A pervasive hype cycle, followed by introspection, correction and maturation. In 2025, vector search is no longer the shiny object everyone pursues blindly — it’s now a critical building block within a more sophisticated, multi-pronged retrieval architecture.The original warnings were right. Pure vector-based hopes often crash on the shoals of precision, relational complexity and enterprise constraints. Yet the technology was never wasted: It forced the industry to rethink retrieval, blending semantic, lexical and relational strategies.If I were to write a sequel in 2027, I suspect it would frame vector databases not as unicorns, but as legacy infrastructure — foundational, but eclipsed by smarter orchestration layers, adaptive retrieval controllers and AI systems that dynamically choose which retrieval tool fits the query.As of now, the real battle is not vector vs keyword — it’s the indirection, blending and discipline in building retrieval pipelines that reliably ground gen AI in facts and domain knowledge.

Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

This model topped our list of the best action cameras, and for good reason. It's a fantastic device with all kinds of bells and whistles. It's the most versatile Hero camera that GoPro has ever made. There's a new family of modular lenses and it can shoot up to 5.3K and handle 2X optical zoom. The battery is bigger than ever before and offers around 90 minutes of continuous shooting in 4K/30FPS. The camera is waterproof up to 10 millimeters, so don't worry about puddles. The full-color front screen is vivid and makes it easy to review footage without getting a computer involved. There's no internal storage here, but it accepts microSD cards. There's a camera bundle on sale right now that includes a 64GB microSD, three batteries, a dual charger and a case.

The 17 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $30 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "standfirst": "Whether you or someone on your gift list has trouble keeping track of their stuff, you can't go wrong by picking up an AirTag for assistance. For Black Friday, you can save on Apple's Bluetooth trackers — a four-pack is on sale for $65 right now, which is just about the lowest price we've seen. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.

The deal for new subscribers is just $49 for the first year, marked down from $98. The real value is in selecting Peacock Premium, which would normally run you $110 per year on its own. With the current discount on a Walmart+ subscription you are essentially getting half off on your streaming subscription for that year. Just about every major streaming service has raised its prices in the last year, including HBO Max, Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV and YouTube TV, so saving some money on one of them just might be worth the effort. Cord cutting is not nearly as affordable as it used to be, so finding a deal like this is pretty helpful. Walmart+ itself offers myriad additional benefits like early access to Black Friday deals, free shipping on orders over $35, discounts on gas, free online veterinary care and more.

This year likely more so than ever thanks to the launch of the Switch 2 back in the spring. But fi you were hoping to save money on the console with Black Friday deals, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Black Friday deals are few and far between. However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

If you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code. There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.

          "title": "Black Friday VPN deals: Proton VPN two-year plans are up to 75 percent off",
          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

It was the fastest of all the cards we tested when transferring games and loading games. We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it.

Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 40 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $150. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots. An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's favorite budget robot vacuum, and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging. This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of its last earning statement. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.

Apple's most affordable smartwatch is even cheaper right now, down to just $200. We consider this to be the best budget Apple Watch, and arguably the best smartwatch for folks who have never owned one before. The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you'll find in those more expensive devices as well. The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 3, which you can snag for $100 off. The sale model comes with 64GB of storage, a 49mm screen and GPS and cellular service. Notably, it's also only available with the one size, adjustable band and in two colors: a Black titanium case with Black Ocean band and a natural titanium Case with Anchor Blue Ocean band. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 came out in early September and is one of the first smartwatches to support satellite communications. This feature means you can call, send messages or share your location with emergency services through the watch — even if you don't have a connection. The new Ultra 3 also has a larger screen thanks to thinner bezels and a battery that can last for up to 42 hours.

          "title": "Dyson Black Friday deals: Get more than $500 off robot and cordless vacuums",
          "standfirst": "Dyson is holding an early Black Friday sale on vacuums and related products. Sure, Black Friday isn't for another month, but who are we to turn down a fantastic deal? To that end, the Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum is a whopping $600 off and down to $400 right now. That's $100 less than its previous all-time low and the cheapest we've seen it. Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) one of the strongest in the category. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we've tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you'll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson's mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you're looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don't mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option. Cordless vacuums are also a part of the sale. Take the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for just $270 at both Dyson and Amazon, which is a discount of $330. That's more than half off. Dyson devices are all over our list of the best cordless vacuums, and for good reason. The company makes effective products. The V9 Motorbar has been designed to clean all floor types, in addition to upholstery. It's also been engineered to squeeze into tight spots, which is great for hitting those oft-neglected parts of the home. The suction power is on point and the battery lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a charge. That's just enough time to vacuum a standard-sized home if you don't stop for too many breaks. The V9 is getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. If you want a newer model, the V11 Extra is on sale for $400, which is a discount of $260. This one boosts the suction power and increases the battery life to 60 minutes.

          "standfirst": "The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop has long hovered at $799 at Amazon — a full $200 below its Apple Store price. But it just dropped down to $749, which is the lowest price we've seen since this model was introduced in March. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, across all four colorways, but the 512GB model is also down to $949 — another all-time low versus the Apple Store price of $1,199. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future. (Read: sometime in early 2026). If you need more screen space, you'll find a similar discount on the 15-inch MacBook Air on Amazon, too. Most color options are $250 off and down to $949 for the base model (you guessed it — another all-time low).

This year is no different, and some of the best discounts bring Fire TV streaming dongles down to near record-low prices. Case in point: the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is 41 percent off and down to only $35. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is one of Engadget's favorite streaming devices. The stick supports a solid mix of advanced technologies for its price: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+. As long as the rest of your entertainment setup can handle it, you'll get a high-quality picture and sound. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E, enabling better, faster connectivity with compatible routers. The 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Amazon Fire TV Stick, so expect zippy navigation. It also supports Amazon's Ambient Experience. This mode displays art (like on Samsung's The Frame) while the device is in standby. It's also a solid choice for gaming: It supports Xbox cloud streaming and works well as a retro game emulator, too. The UI is where Amazon appears to be subsidizing the device's low cost. Expect to see loads of Prime Video content promos, along with other ads. But for $35 (compared to its MSRP of $60), you may find it easier to justify that tradeoff. Also on sale is Amazon's Fire TV Stick HD, our pick for the best budget streaming stick. This model doesn't support 4K; instead, it limits you to 1080p at 60 fps. At $18 for Black Friday, it's certainly cheap. But if you have a 4K TV (or plan to soon), you may want to consider the slightly more expensive model.

          "title": "How to add someone to an Apple Family account",
          "standfirst": "Apple’s Family Sharing feature is designed to make digital life simpler for households that use multiple Apple devices. It links individual Apple IDs under one family group so everyone can share subscriptions, purchases and storage without sacrificing personal privacy. A single organizer manages the group and decides who’s invited, what’s shared and how payments are handled. Once someone joins, they can access shared Apple services like Music, TV+, iCloud+, Fitness+ or Arcade, along with any compatible third-party apps that support Family Sharing. Setting it up only takes a few minutes, but understanding how it works makes it far easier to manage long-term. Whether you’re adding a new partner, a roommate or creating an Apple ID for a child, the process is similar across iPhone, iPad and Mac, and each person keeps their own private account within the shared ecosystem. Getting started with Family Sharing Before adding someone new, make sure you’re the organizer of the family group. The organizer controls invitations and payment preferences, while each member uses their own Apple ID to sign in. You can manage everything from the Settings app on iPhone or System Settings on Mac. It’s worth checking for software updates first, since Family Sharing menus can vary slightly between iOS versions. When you’re ready, open Settings, tap your name at the top then select Family. From there, you’ll see a summary of your group, any shared subscriptions and the option to add new members. Apple will ask whether you’d like to invite an existing user or create an account for a child who doesn’t yet have an Apple ID. Invitations can be sent through Messages, Mail or AirDrop, and if the person is nearby, you can let them enter their details directly on your device. On a Mac, the process looks a little different but leads to the same result. Open System Settings, select your name then choose Family. You can then add a member, send an invite or set up a child account with appropriate parental controls. Once the invitation is accepted, the person automatically appears in your group list. How to manage what’s shared with Family Sharing When someone joins, they instantly gain access to the subscriptions and features that the organizer has made available. That can include Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness+, along with the shared iCloud+ storage plan if you have one. Photos, calendars and location information can also be shared through the Family section of the Settings app, letting everyone see joint reminders, events or device locations through Find My. If purchase sharing is enabled, everyone in the group can use the organizer’s payment method for App Store and iTunes purchases. Each transaction is still tied to the buyer’s own Apple ID, but it’s billed to the organizer’s payment method. It’s entirely optional, and you can disable it if you’d prefer each person to pay separately. Shared purchases can still be re-downloaded by other members from their purchase history without paying again, so long as the app or media supports Family Sharing. Parents also gain access to tools like Screen Time and Ask to Buy, which give them oversight of a child’s activity. These options appear automatically when you create a child account and can be fine-tuned later from the organizer’s device. For example, Ask to Buy can send a notification each time a child tries to install a new app or make an in-app purchase, letting the organizer approve or decline it in real time. Inviting children and setting boundaries Creating an account for a child works slightly differently from inviting an adult. Apple requires a parent or guardian to set up the account directly from their own device, adding the child’s name, birthday and Apple ID credentials during setup. The age you enter determines what privacy and parental-control features are switched on by default, such as limits on explicit music or app downloads. Once the child’s account is created, it behaves like any other Apple ID but remains tied to the family group until the child reaches the minimum age to leave or until the organizer removes them. Screen Time reports, purchase requests and content restrictions can all be adjusted as the child gets older. It’s a flexible way to give kids their own Apple ID and access to family-purchased content without sharing login details. Common issues and how to fix them Most people can add members without any problems, but sometimes the invitation process can stall. If the person you’re inviting doesn’t see the request, resend it from the Family settings and ask them to check their Messages or Mail. Invitations occasionally end up in spam folders or are filtered by older devices. If they’ve previously joined a different Family Sharing group, they’ll need to leave that one before they can accept your invite. It’s also possible to hit the group limit. Family Sharing supports one organizer and up to five additional members, for a total of six people in one group. If you try to invite more, you’ll be prompted to remove someone before adding another. And if the Family menu doesn’t show the option to add members at all, double-check that you’re signed in with the organizer’s Apple ID, as members without organizer privileges won’t see those options. If someone accepts but can’t see shared subscriptions, open the Subscriptions page under your Apple ID in Settings and ensure the toggle for “Share with Family” is switched on. For iCloud+ storage, confirm that the plan you’re sharing is large enough to include everyone’s data. Why Family Sharing is worth setting up Once everything is configured, Family Sharing can quietly simplify the way your household uses Apple’s ecosystem. Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions or repeating purchases, the organizer can consolidate everything in one place. Each member keeps their personal messages, photos and preferences, but benefits from shared apps, music and cloud storage. It’s also the easiest way to manage children’s digital habits while still giving them independence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-add-someone-to-an-apple-family-account-130033896.html?src=rss",

It’s also the easiest way to manage children’s digital habits while still giving them independence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-add-someone-to-an-apple-family-account-130033896.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The busiest section of the holiday season is just two weeks away and we’re shoring up our reviews library with some of the products that might be on your list. We’ve got another well-rounded round-up this week, spanning multiple product categories and even taking another look at an older device. Read on for everything you might’ve missed. Apple Watch SE 3 You don’t have to sacrifice as much as you used to if you want to save money on a current Apple Watch. Managing editor Cherlynn Low makes the case for the Apple Watch SE 3, laying out the specific items she missed from the Apple Watch Series 11. “In the end, it wasn’t the features like blood oxygen readings or hypertension notifications that I wanted back,” she explained. “It boiled down to physical components like a brighter display or bigger battery and more durable case that I wanted around for peace of mind.” Apple Vision Pro M5 Apple’s M5 refresh for the Vision Pro is an improvement, but the product still very much feels like it’s in the beta phase. The main problem? Price. “Once again, the Vision Pro feels like a proof of concept — a symbol of what Apple can do when it’s not constrained by traditional screens,” senior reporter Devindra Hardawar said. “But the company’s dream of spatial computing won’t go anywhere until it can deliver cheaper devices.” DJI Neo 2 The biggest problem with the DJI Neo drone was its deafening howl, and on the way to (somewhat) fixing that issue, the company added a host of new features for the Neo 2. The result is a highly capable drone that’s now the best budget option. “It retains everything I liked about the Neo, especially the ease of use and safety features,” contributing reporter Steve Dent wrote. “On top of that, it adds a host of useful functions like obstacle protection and, thank goodness, lower noise levels.” Acer Predator Triton 14 AI Gaming laptops are rarely actually portable. According to senior reporter Sam Rutherford, Acer has managed to fix that with the Predator Triton 14 AI. “In a lot of ways, this isn't just a travel-friendly gaming machine, it's a true do-everything ultraportable,” he explained. OnePlus 15 There’s a lot to like about the OnePlus 15, including the processor, display and battery. What you have to contend with is a basic design and subpar cameras. “If you’re okay with a worse camera overall, the OP15 has a lot going for it, and provided OnePlus can successfully navigate an uncertain tariff regime, it will end up not just one of the best phones of 2025 but much of 2026 too,” senior reporter Igor Bonifacic said. Other reviews you might have missed Those devices aren’t all we’ve been testing over the last two weeks. I spent some time with Bowers & Wilkins’ luxurious Px8 S2 headphones. Reviews contributor James Trew put the Rodecaster Video S through its paces and deputy editor Nathan Ingraham met Alexa+ via the Echo Dot Max. Senior editor Daniel Cooper is keeping tabs on Framework’s modular, upgradable PCs and he reviewed the 2025 update for the Laptop 16. Speaking of laptops, senior reporter Amy Skorheim took on the rare feat of reviewing a laptop charger, proclaiming the Anker Laptop Power Bank as an outstanding option for your gear bag. Sony recently gave the PlayStation Portal a big upgrade, so Devindra had a third review stint with the two-year-old gaming handheld.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-apple-watch-se-3-dji-neo-2-playstation-portal-and-more-130000029.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As ever, it's been a busy week of new games arriving and details of upcoming releases emerging. Before we get to some of those though, the nominees for the second annual Indie Game Awards were announced this week. There's a nice mix of big hitters and smaller, but equally worthy titles among the Game of the Year contenders. Those are:Absolum - Dotemu, Guard Crush Games and Supamonksand Roger - TearyHand StudioBlue Prince - DogubombCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector - Jump Over the AgeClair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Sandfall InteractiveConsume Me - Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P and Ken \"coda\" SnyderHades II - Supergiant GamesHollow Knight: Silksong - Team CherryKeep Driving - YCJY GamesPipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo - Pocket TrapConsume Me and and Roger are two I've been meaning to check out for a while. I'm also yet to hop into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is arguably the frontrunner here — it's looking like the favorite for top honors at The Game Awards next month as well. There are a whole bunch of worthy contenders in other categories, from hits like Discounty and the charmingly bittersweet Time Flies, to solo-developed projects like Spilled! and Vile: Exhumed. The supremely addictive Ball x Pit picked up a nod, but it's going against the tremendous Öoo (and Absolum, Hades II and Silksong) in the gameplay design category. It's neat to see Playdate game Taria & Como earn recognition too. The Indie Game Awards ceremony takes place on December 18 at 6:30PM ET. You can watch it on YouTube and Twitch. New releasesThe new release I'm most looking forward to trying when I have a chance is Windswept, a precision platformer that's inspired by similar games from the '90s like Donkey Kong Country. Marbles the duck and Checkers the turtle each have unique movement abilities, and you'll need to swap between the pair to best navigate environments. You'll be trying to help them get back home after a storm whisked them away.There are lots of secrets to discover across the 40-plus levels, animal buddies to ride and much more. I grew up with games like this one from WeatherFell and publisher Top Hat Studios, which looks completely up my alley. Windswept is out now on Steam, GOG, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S for $20.The Devolver Digital-published Possessor(s) is something a little different from Hyper Light Drifter studio Heart Machine. This is a horror-inflected Metroidvania and the developers drew inspiration from platform fighters for the combat. Here, high school student Luca forms an alliance with a demon in need of a host following \"an interdimensional catastrophe.\" They team up to stay alive and discover what led to the disaster.As with Heart Machine's other games, it looks very pretty, but reviews for Possessor(s) — which is out on PS5 and PC — have been fairly mixed so far. Things haven't exactly been going great for Heart Machine overall. The studio last month laid off staff and ended development of Hyper Light Breaker, which remains in early access. As with its earlier game Before Your Eyes, Nice Dream says its latest project, Goodnight Universe, is best played with a camera. There's the option to interact with the game using your eye movement and facial expressions. That makes a lot of sense for Goodnight Universe, which casts you in the role of a six-month-old baby with psychic powers. Little Isaac just wants familial love, but a shadowy tech corporation is looking to take custody of him.Skybound Games is the publisher of Goodnight Universe, which is available on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam for $20. A Switch version is coming on December 18, and an update that will bring camera support to the Switch 2 edition is on the way.Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution is a turn-based strategy game that affords you the chance to shift the outcome of the French Revolution. An opportunity to revolutionize the revolution, as it were. You can defend, depose or even reform the monarchy. As the title suggests, you'll have mechs at your disposal in battle — to that end, this reminds me a bit of the clockpunk soulslike Steelrising, which was also set during the French Revolution. Bonaparte - A Mechanized Revolution, from Studio Imugi and co-publisher 2P Games, left early access on Steam this week. It costs $20.Upcoming I'm very happy to continue this little run of including a dog game in this roundup every week with something new on the beautifully titled Barkour. As part of Steam Animal Fest (which runs until Monday and includes a sale on games like Tunic and Hello Kitty Island Adventure), Varsav Game Studios unleashed a new trailer and an updated Steam demo. Here, you play as Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R., a special agent with gadgets galore and plenty of bite to go with the bark. On missions, you can play the stealthy way, fight your enemies head on or carry out barkour parkour runs. Varsav Game Studios is hoping to release Barkour in 2026.Next up, we have release dates for a pair of cafe sims, starting with Tailside. As a furry cafe owner, you'll be looking to perfect the art of coffee making so you can serve delicious concoctions to your patrons. You can even create foam art on lattes for an extra-special touch.In this game from solo developer Coffee Beans Dev, you can customize your cafe to your liking. There are no timers to worry about, so you can play at your own pace. Tailside is coming to Steam on January 21. A demo is available now.As revealed during the State of Play Japan showcase this week, the latest entry in the Coffee Talk series is bound for Steam, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch on March 5. Chorus Worldwide Games and Toge Productions' Coffee Talk Tokyo places you in the role of a barista who hears out their clientele.The drinks you make (which you can enhance with sprinkle stencils for latte art) help shape your conversations with customers and have a bearing on the branching storylines. Coffee Talk and Coffee Talk Episode 2 composer Andrew “AJ” Jeremy returned to craft another lo-fi soundtrack for the latest installment.A release window for InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories was confirmed during the State of Play Tokyo stream as well. It's coming to Steam and consoles, including PS5, in April. There's a Steam demo available now. From Nagai Industries, this simulator puts you in the role of a college student and employee of a small-town Japanese convenience store (a konbini) in the early 1990s. You'll decide which products to sell, and order and restock goods. More importantly, you'll have to deliver exceptional customer service. That involves having conversations with customers, which will sometimes end up having an impact on their lives. It seems quite lovely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/old-school-platforming-metroidvania-horror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000751.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "EcoFlow is hosting an early Black Friday sale on portable power stations. This drops prices by up to 42 percent on many of its well-regarded products. For instance, the Delta Pro 3 is on sale for $2,299. This is a discount of 37 percent, as the typical cost is $3,699. That's a significant drop in price. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,599. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle. The Delta Pro 3 is just one of the products on sale right now. The Delta Pro Ultra, which is intended as a whole-home backup, is down to $3,999. This represents a savings of more than $2,000. Another Yahoo top pick, the Delta 2 Max, is $1,000 off and down to $899.

While it's possible to do it all yourself, budgeting apps can automate some processes and make it easier to see where your money is going and patterns, both good and bad, that might be occurring. For Black Friday, you can get 50 percent off our favorite budgeting app, Quicken Simplifi. The Quicken Simplifi app is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year. Quicken Classic, the company's \"original desktop software\" for \"experienced investors\" is also half off at $6 monthly, down from $12 monthly. The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. One of the many things that sets Quicken Simplifi apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.

          "content": "When Aristotle claimed that humans differ from other animals because they have the ability to be rational, he understood rational to mean that we could form our views and beliefs based on evidence, and that we could reconsider that evidence. “You know—ask ourselves if we should really believe that based on the evidence we’ve got,” says Jan M. Engelmann, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Engelmann says that from the beginning of the Western intellectual tradition, people thought that only humans are rational. So, he designed a study to see if rationality shows up in chimpanzees. It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are. Food puzzles “There was quite a bit of research showing that chimpanzees can form their beliefs in response to evidence,” Engelmann says. The experiments usually involved chimpanzees deciding which of the two boxes contained a snack. When the researchers shook both boxes and there was a rattling sound coming from one of them, the chimps almost always chose the box where the rattling came from.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Edmontosaurus annectens, a large herbivore duck-billed dinosaur that lived toward the end of the Cretaceous period, was discovered back in 1908 in east-central Wyoming by C.H. Sternberg, a fossil collector. The skeleton, later housed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and nicknamed the “AMNH mummy,” was covered by scaly skin imprinted in the surrounding sediment that gave us the first approximate idea of what the animal looked like. More than a century later, a team of paleontologists led by Paul C. Sereno, a professor of organismal biology at the University of Chicago, got back to the same exact place where Sternberg dug up the first Edmontosaurus specimen. The researchers found two more Edmontosaurus mummies with all fleshy external anatomy imprinted in a sub-millimeter layer of clay. For the first time, we uncovered an accurate image of what Edmontosaurus really looked like, down to the tiniest details, like the size of its scales and the arrangement of spikes on its tail. And we were in for at least a few surprises. Evolving images Our view of Edmontosaurus changed over time, even before Sereno’s study. The initial drawing of Edmontosaurus was made in 1909 by Charles R. Knight, a famous paleoartist, who based his visualization on the first specimen found by Sternberg. “He was accurate in some ways, but he made a mistake in that he drew the crest extending throughout the entire length of the body,” Sereno says. The mummy Knight based his drawing on had no tail, so understandably, the artist used his imagination to fill in the gaps and made the Edmontosaurus look a little bit like a dragon.Read full article Comments",
