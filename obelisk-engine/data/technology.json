Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic will be a collaboration between Lucasfilm Games and Arcanaut Studios, a new development house being launched by original KOTOR director Casey Hudson. Hudson, who will serve as director on the new game, said in an interview with StarWars.com that he has remained in contact with Lucasfilm since the KOTOR days, in the hopes of being able to collaborate in the Star Wars universe again. “It took the right conditions to get everything to line up,” he told the site. Calling KOTOR “one of the defining experiences of my career,” Hudson said he wants to “explore a contemporary vision” of the Star Wars universe, and “deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars” that defined the original games. As director on the upcoming game, Hudson said he sees his role as “to gather and shape a cohesive vision that the entire team contributes to. Ensuring that everyone shares that vision and understands their part in creating it, is critical to the success of a project.”Read full article Comments",

          "standfirst": "On Thursday evening, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for a single, nationwide regulatory framework governing artificial intelligence at the expense of the ability of different states to regulate the nascent technology. “To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,” the order states. “But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.” As was expected after a draft of the order leaked earlier this week, the centerpiece of the document is an “AI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge state AI laws inconsistent” with the president’s policy vision. US Attorney General Pam Bondi has 30 days to create the task force, which shall meet regularly with the White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks. As laid out in the president’s AI Action Plan from July, the administration will also limit states with “onerous” AI laws from accessing federal funding. Specifically, the secretary of commerce will target funding available under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed internet access in rural communities. Advocacy groups were quick to criticize the president’s order. “This executive order is designed to chill state-level action to provide oversight and accountability for the developers and deployers of AI systems, while doing nothing to address the real and documented harms these systems create,” Alexandra Givens, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in a statement provided to Engadget. “States that take steps to protect their residents from such harms should not be subject to threats of legal attacks; nor should the administration punish rural Americans by threatening to withhold funding for the broadband services that could connect them to AI in the first place.”It’s worth noting President Trump’s previous attempts to curb the ability of states to regulate AI as they see fit has proven unpopular across the political spectrum. As part of his One Big Beautiful Bill, the president attempted to impose a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. That clause was eventually removed from the legislation in a decisive 99-1 vote by the Senate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-creation-of-litigation-task-force-to-challenge-state-ai-laws-022657022.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Remedy Entertainment's Control is a bizarre yet totally captivating action game that feels like Die Hard by way of David Lynch. InControl: Resonant, players step into the role of the original game's most enigmatic and unsettling characters for their own jaunt through a 'new-weird' world outside The Oldest House.Just ahead of the reveal at The Game Awards, we got an early look at Control: Resonant, the next game in the Remedy Connected Universe. Along with learning why the developers wanted a new protagonist, they also explain why this Neon Genesis Evangelion-inspired sequel is the most expansive game they have made to date.Seven years after the events of Control, the hostile supernatural force that plagued The Oldest House has invaded Manhattan. As the massive urban landscape morphs into an otherworldly nightmare and the Federal Bureau of Control director, Jesse Faden, goes missing, the remaining FBC sends her brother, the notorious supernatural entity Dylan Faden, into the city to stop the invasion. To find his sister and stop the devastation from spreading beyond New York City, Dylan will have to embrace his powers, and some occasional guidance from The Board, to take on the malevolent forces looking to reshape the world.In the years since Control's release, developer Remedy has expanded the story into a larger, connected universe spanning multiple games, including the Alan Wake series and the co-op spin-off FBC: Firebreak. Control: Resonant picks up on many threads left by recent games including Alan Wake 2, which saw the FBC investigate the supernatural events following the titular character. However, the sequel is going with a bit of a different direction, this time embracing melee-driven combat and a more \"open-ended\" approach to exploration within the Inception-style landscape of Manhattan. Though the developers were clear that it is not an open-world game, they stated during the presentation that it is embracing a more action-RPG approach and that it's also the most expansive game they have ever made.It's an interesting premise for a sequel, especially considering the focus on the original game's most unnerving characters. But according to creative director Mikael Kasurinen, the concept ties into showing parallels between the Faden siblings and how they navigate this new-weird world.\"Each game represents one of the siblings and their respective journeys through this world. Because of this, you can play these games in any order; they stand on their own feet like two independent siblings,\" Kasurinen said. \"When Dylan wakes up, he's the only one who can fight back against the Hiss and try to contain the disaster. He has lived his whole life inside The Oldest House, so the door leading outside to Manhattan might as well be a portal to an alien world. To him, this leads to a discovery of a new reality, just like what The Oldest House was to Jesse.\"Much like the original game, Control: Resonant maintains that balance of exploration, discovery, and over-the-top action beats to overcome. The sequel leans a bit further into the latter, with Dylan adopting a more aggressive, brawler combat style with his shapeshifting melee weapon. We got to see Dylan switch between short-bladed weapons and a massive hammer, which opened some cool looking combo attacks. It's very much in the vein of Jesse's Service Weapon, but now designed for getting up close to deal heavy melee damage.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentFrom what we saw in the footage, the core combat feels equal parts Nier: Automata and DmC: Devil May Cry, showing Dylan dodging attacks and slipping through blind spots to unleash ground and aerial combo strikes. It's a notable shift away from the third-person shooting gameplay from the original, but it still captures the same weird, otherworldly feel. According to the creative director, the core inspiration for making a sequel with a new character was to contrast storytelling perspectives and gameplay styles — as he puts it, both characters represent two sides of the same coin.\"When we looked at the siblings [as characters], it was almost like turning to the other side of a coin – Jesse uses a gun, but Dylan chooses a melee weapon. When we created the large environments, compared to the original, it was a challenge to incorporate shooting combat, as we didn't want people to have to keep finding cover to avoid fire. But with melee weapons, the combat instantly became more aggressive and intimate, where you're really going for the enemies. It really changed the dynamic of the Control combat experience. So it felt right, and it's also refreshing for us to create something a bit new for us.\"So far, Control: Resonant looks like a sequel that ups the weirdness of the series and takes it into the twisting, inverted streets of Manhattan. It's a stunning-looking game, and one particular source of inspiration for the creative direction was the seminal 1990s anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Having seen the game's corrupted world and enigmatic protagonist in motion, that totally tracks. I can't wait to see what other oddities are to come in Remedy's new-weird sequel.Control: Resonant will arrive in 2026 for PC/Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.Control Resonant screenshotRemedy EntertainmentThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/control-resonant-steps-into-a-larger-world-thats-inspired-by-neon-genesis-evangelion-021310781.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Ten years after The Witness, Jonathan Blow's next massive puzzle game is almost ready for primetime",
          "standfirst": "Many of the big announcements at The Game Awards are for completely new projects, some of which are total surprises (if you had an Okami sequel on your bingo card last year, you're either in the know or probably used up all your luck for the next few years). We'll often get updates on games that were previously announced too. The trailer for Order of the Sinking Star is something a little different, as it's a game that Braid designer Jonathan Blow has been working on fairly openly since releasing The Witness in 2016. The trailer revealed some new details, including confirmation of the expected title and a release window (2026 on Steam, with more platforms to be announced). Ahead of The Game Awards, Blow gave Engadget a preview of the game and explained some of its many complexities.Fundamentally, Order of the Sinking Star is a grid-based puzzle game in which you'll move blocks around to complete an objective. You might know of this as a Sokoban game, named after the series Hiroyuki Imabayashi created about pushing boxes around a warehouse.But this is a Jonathan Blow game, so nothing stays too simple for very long. Blow and his team took the core concept of pushing objects around and built on it in myriad ways, with a wide array of environments, mechanics and characters for you to get to grips with. Order of the Sinking Star starts with you playing as a deposed queen from another world who is transported to a strange place. This turns out to be the tutorial. Among other things, you'll find out about the undo button, a handy option you can use to revert your actions if you get stuck. It's probably worth being careful with this button, as Blow says it's possible to undo thousands of moves with it. There's a level reset option too.The first phase of the game has four distinct territories with their own characters, stories and gameplay mechanics. One of these realms has a fantasy theme with a warrior character who can push multiple objects that are in a row. His friend, the thief, can only pull objects. The wizard, meanwhile, can teleport and swap positions with objects or other characters. Sometimes, you'll use multiple characters in a level and swap between them to solve puzzles. There’s a talking boat somewhere, too.You'll take what you learn within individual levels into the overworld so you can make progress there. For one thing, the queen can wear a warrior, wizard or thief outfit to adopt their abilities and solve puzzles in the north section of this phase. Over in the east, there’s a world with mirror-based puzzles. By positioning the mirrors and where you stand, you'll use the mirror's reflection to teleport at a right angle. If your character (or an object) has a reflection in two mirrors, they can be duplicated, which is something you might have to do a few times if a level requires you activate multiple switches at the same time.Once you near the end of two of the phase one worlds, you can enter one of six gold rooms. In these rooms, which are the gateways to the second phase of Order of the Sinking Star, some of your characters meet each other for the first time. For instance, the guy from The Mirror Isles and the wizard might encounter each other in a gold room and then you can use their combined abilities to solve puzzles. Given that later-game levels combine mechanics from the early stages, they are naturally more complex. Shifting to 3D perspectives will ramp things up too.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesYou can tackle the four worlds that make up the first phase in any order. Collectively, they contain \"days worth of gameplay,\" Blow said. And yet he claimed this first phase accounts for about five percent of the entire game. All told, there are about 1,400 puzzles, many of which are optional. If you're a completionist, you'll need to be pretty dedicated to see this through. Blow estimates that it'll take around 500 hours for a player to do absolutely everything in the game. The overworld has more than 100 screens from which you can jump into individual levels. \"All the levels are about ideas. They're not just random puzzles,\" Blow said. \"We don't add puzzles to the game unless they show something cool about how the objects interact. Then, once you see the cool thing, you come back to the overworld, and you navigate from that screen using the cool mechanic that you learned.\"\"We\" is a key word there, because it's not as if Blow has been making Order of the Sinking Star by himself for the last decade. His studio, Thekla, has around 10 people working on the game full-time along with another 10 or so part-time contractors. Those who contributed include puzzle game designers Alan Hazelden and Marc ten Bosch. Some members of Blow's Twitch community who \"contributed some idea to one of the levels somewhere\" will receive design credits too.Blow and his team use custom game engines for their projects. Starting in around 2013, he started livestreaming his work on the programming language that Order of the Sinking Star is written in (Thekla will eventually make the engine available for free as an open-source project). \"Once I was working on the game, it was a good way to show people what the programming language was about and also how game programming works, and so I would frequently do just streams where we would sit down and implement something,\" Blow said. Some of the design work he did on stream ended up in the final game.Order of the Sinking StarThekla/Arc GamesAfter such a long time of working on Order of the Sinking Star, the end is in sight for Blow and his team. The main focus for the last year or so has been on making sure all of the puzzles align with the overworld. Making art for many hundreds of levels is a major undertaking too, while Blow is still refining the story. \"Because there's a lot of these levels and a lot of characters in the levels, it's just natural for them to talk to each other,\" Blow said. \"And so what is that dialog and what does it do? Is it just little jokes that don't add up to anything? Or do you get little peeks into a larger narrative? I think the latter is obviously better. And so that's my main task between now and release, is making sure that the story is really good.\"Blow had the core concept of having separate worlds with mechanics that work across them in place from the very beginning, though how that worked in practice evolved a lot over time. For instance, the overworld idea wasn't set in stone from the outset. There was an overworld in place by around 2021, \"but it wasn't organized in the way the current one was. It was just sort of areas smushed together,\" Blow said. \"At some point, I came up with this concept that it was spatially organized in an almost ritualistic manner or a mathematical manner, whichever way you want to think about it. And we redesigned the overworld from that point, and from then till now, it's been just sort of a continuous improvement.\"Order of the Sinking Star was originally supposed to be a much smaller game that took around 10 or 20 hours to play, but \"it just blew up,\" Blow said. \"Part of development has just been dealing with that fact. Like, oh, my God, this game took so long to make. It actually feels really good to be here toward the end. We still have a fair bit of work to do before it's done, but we can see the ending from where we are now, and that's great.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ten-years-after-the-witness-jonathan-blows-next-massive-puzzle-game-is-almost-ready-for-primetime-015727378.html?src=rss",

It stars a hero rarely seen in video games, an elderly woman, and it has gorgeous storybook-style art in a lush fantasy setting. It’s a single-player puzzle platformer, it relies on wordless storytelling and the woman, a witch named Gertie, travels with a creepy-cute companion. Plus, Gertie has chicken feet. I love her little chicken feet.Coven of the Chicken Foot is the first game from Wildflower Interactive, the independent studio founded by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley. The game is coming to Steam and it’s available to wishlist now, though there’s no firm release date. The first trailer for Coven of the Chicken Foot premiered at The Game Awards 2025, showing Gertie and her friend traveling together through caves, forests and temples. Gertie is on a quest to prove herself to the local coven by standing up to the self-appointed, prideful heroes of the land. She doesn’t have a sword or a dodgeroll, and instead has to figure out how to work with her strange friend to survive. Her companion develops unique behaviors based on individual play styles, shaping how Gertie gets around.Straley left Naughty Dog in 2017 after almost 20 years with the studio, where he directed The Last of Us and Uncharted 4. He announced Wildflower Interactive in July 2022 with a brief YouTube message, saying, “In 2017 I left the industry not sure if I wanted to make games anymore. But the longer I was away, I kept thinking about this medium, and everything yet to be done and everything I wanted to do still. And this idea kept following me. So I grabbed some friends and we started prototyping.”This naturally led to the formation of a studio, Straley explained. “We have to do it the right way,” he said in the video. “It has to be inclusive, equitable and collaborative, full of big-hearted people that want to grow both professionally and personally. The culture needs to be as iterative as the way we make games.”Coven of the Chicken FootWildflower InteractiveToday Wildflower Interactive has 16 employees from AAA and smaller-scale backgrounds, according to its website. Its mission statement reads as follows:“We’re making ‘small-ish,’ creatively-charged, uniquely-stylized games that explore the possibilities of our medium. And we’re building a small, open-hearted team of creators that want to improve their skills and still lead a good life outside of work. People that want to hone their craft, have a say in the process, feel respected for their contributions, and be a part of the evolution of this awesome medium.”I’m not going to say the studio’s direct and repeated emphasis on work-life balance, diversity and compassion is a response to the soulless capitalistic grind built into the AAA development complex, but I’m not going to not say that, either.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/coven-of-the-chicken-foot-is-the-debut-game-from-naughty-dog-alum-bruce-straleys-indie-studio-014004553.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has officially released GPT-5.2, and the reactions from early testers — among whom OpenAI seeded the model several days prior to public release, in some cases weeks ago — paints a two toned picture: it is a monumental leap forward for deep, autonomous reasoning and coding, yet potentially an underwhelming \"incremental\" update for casual conversationalists.Following early access periods and today&#x27;s broader rollout, executives, developers, and analysts have taken to X (formerly Twitter) and company blogs to share their first testing results. Here is a roundup of the first reactions to OpenAI’s latest flagship model.\"AI as a serious analyst\"The strongest praise for GPT-5.2 centers on its ability to handle \"hard problems\" that require extended thinking time.Matt Shumer, CEO of HyperWriteAI, did not mince words in his review, calling GPT-5.2 Pro \"the best model in the world.\" Shumer highlighted the model&#x27;s tenacity, noting that \"it thinks for **over an hour** on hard problems. And it nails tasks no other model can touch.\"This sentiment was echoed by Allie K. Miller, an AI entrepreneur and former AWS executive. Miller described the model as a step toward \"AI as a serious analyst\" rather than a \"friendly companion.\"\"The thinking and problem-solving feel noticeably stronger,\" Miller wrote on X. \"It gives much deeper explanations than I’m used to seeing. At one point it literally wrote code to improve its own OCR in the middle of a task.\"Enterprise gains: Box reports distinct performance jumpsFor the enterprise sector, the update appears to be even more significant. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, revealed on X that his company has been testing GPT-5.2 in early access. Levie reported that the model performs \"7 points better than GPT-5.1\" on their expanded reasoning tests, which approximate real-world knowledge work in financial services and life sciences.\"The model performed the majority of the tasks far faster than GPT-5.1 and GPT-5 as well,\" Levie noted, confirming that Box AI will be rolling out GPT-5.2 integration shortly.Rutuja Rajwade, a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Box, expanded on this in a company blog post, citing specific latency improvements. \"Complex extraction\" tasks dropped from 46 seconds on GPT-5 to just 12 seconds with GPT-5.2. Rajwade also noted a jump in reasoning capabilities for the Media and Entertainment vertical, rising from 76% accuracy in GPT-5.1 to 81% in the new model.A \"serious leap\" for coding and simulationDevelopers are finding GPT-5.2 particularly potent for \"one-shot\" generation of complex code structures.Pietro Schirano, CEO of magicpathai, shared a video of the model building a full 3D graphics engine in a single file with interactive controls. \"It’s a serious leap forward in complex reasoning, math, coding, and simulations,\" Schirano posted. \"The pace of progress is unreal.\"Similarly, Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and longtime LLM and AI power user and writer, demonstrated the model&#x27;s ability to create a visually complex shader—an infinite neo-gothic city in a stormy ocean—via a single prompt.The Agentic Era: Long-running autonomyPerhaps the most functional shift is the model&#x27;s ability to stay on task for hours without losing the thread.Dan Shipper, CEO of thoughtful AI testing newsletter Every, reported that the model successfully performed a profit and loss (P&L) analysis that required it to work autonomously for two hours. \"It did a P&L analysis where it worked for 2 hours and gave me great results,\" Shipper wrote.However, Shipper also noted that for day-to-day tasks, the update feels \"mostly incremental.\" In an article for Every, Katie Parrott wrote that while GPT-5.2 excels at instruction following, it is \"less resourceful\" than competitors like Claude Opus 4.5 in certain contexts, such as deducing a user&#x27;s location from email data.The downsides: Speed and RigidityDespite the reasoning capabilities, the \"feel\" of the model has drawn critique.Shumer highlighted a significant \"speed penalty\" when using the model&#x27;s Thinking mode. \"In my experience the Thinking mode is very slow for most questions,\" Shumer wrote in his deep-dive review. \"I almost never use Instant.\"Allie Miller also pointed out issues with the model&#x27;s default behavior. \"The downside is tone and format,\" she noted. \"The default voice felt a bit more rigid, and the length/markdown behavior is extreme: a simple question turned into 58 bullets and numbered points.\"The VerdictThe early reaction suggests that GPT-5.2 is a tool optimized for power users, developers, and enterprise agents rather than casual chat. As Shumer summarized in his review: \"For deep research, complex reasoning, and tasks that benefit from careful thought, GPT-5.2 Pro is the best option available right now.\"However, for users seeking creative writing or quick, fluid answers, models like Claude Opus 4.5 remain strong competitors. \"My favorite model remains Claude Opus 4.5,\" Miller admitted, \"but my complex ChatGPT work will get a nice incremental boost.\"",

Rajwade also noted a jump in reasoning capabilities for the Media and Entertainment vertical, rising from 76% accuracy in GPT-5.1 to 81% in the new model.A \"serious leap\" for coding and simulationDevelopers are finding GPT-5.2 particularly potent for \"one-shot\" generation of complex code structures.Pietro Schirano, CEO of magicpathai, shared a video of the model building a full 3D graphics engine in a single file with interactive controls. \"It’s a serious leap forward in complex reasoning, math, coding, and simulations,\" Schirano posted. \"The pace of progress is unreal.\"Similarly, Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and longtime LLM and AI power user and writer, demonstrated the model&#x27;s ability to create a visually complex shader—an infinite neo-gothic city in a stormy ocean—via a single prompt.The Agentic Era: Long-running autonomyPerhaps the most functional shift is the model&#x27;s ability to stay on task for hours without losing the thread.Dan Shipper, CEO of thoughtful AI testing newsletter Every, reported that the model successfully performed a profit and loss (P&L) analysis that required it to work autonomously for two hours. \"It did a P&L analysis where it worked for 2 hours and gave me great results,\" Shipper wrote.However, Shipper also noted that for day-to-day tasks, the update feels \"mostly incremental.\" In an article for Every, Katie Parrott wrote that while GPT-5.2 excels at instruction following, it is \"less resourceful\" than competitors like Claude Opus 4.5 in certain contexts, such as deducing a user&#x27;s location from email data.The downsides: Speed and RigidityDespite the reasoning capabilities, the \"feel\" of the model has drawn critique.Shumer highlighted a significant \"speed penalty\" when using the model&#x27;s Thinking mode. \"In my experience the Thinking mode is very slow for most questions,\" Shumer wrote in his deep-dive review. \"I almost never use Instant.\"Allie Miller also pointed out issues with the model&#x27;s default behavior. \"The downside is tone and format,\" she noted. \"The default voice felt a bit more rigid, and the length/markdown behavior is extreme: a simple question turned into 58 bullets and numbered points.\"The VerdictThe early reaction suggests that GPT-5.2 is a tool optimized for power users, developers, and enterprise agents rather than casual chat. As Shumer summarized in his review: \"For deep research, complex reasoning, and tasks that benefit from careful thought, GPT-5.2 Pro is the best option available right now.\"However, for users seeking creative writing or quick, fluid answers, models like Claude Opus 4.5 remain strong competitors. \"My favorite model remains Claude Opus 4.5,\" Miller admitted, \"but my complex ChatGPT work will get a nice incremental boost.\"",

          "standfirst": "This morning Disney and OpenAI announced a three-year licensing agreement: Starting in 2026, ChatGPT and Sora can generate images and videos incorporating Disney IP, including more than 200 characters from the company's stable of Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel brands. To say these companies make for strange bedfellows is an understatement. The agreement brings together two parties with very different public stances on copyright. Before OpenAI released Sora, the company reportedly notified studios and talent agencies they would need to opt out of having their work appear in the new app. The company later backtracked on this stance. Before that, OpenAI admitted, in a regulatory filing, it would be \"impossible to train today's leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.\" By contrast, Disney takes copyright law very seriously. In fact, you could argue no other company has done more to shape US copyright law than Disney. For example, there's the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which is more derisively known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. The law effectively froze the advancement of the public domain in the United States, with Disney being the greatest beneficiary. It was only last year that the company's copyright for Steamboat Willie expired, 95 years after Walt Disney first created the iconic cartoon.On the face of it, it's unclear OpenAI is getting much value out of the deal. As part of the pact, Disney will host a \"curated\" selection of Sora-generated videos on its streaming platform Disney+, legitimizing the medium of AI-generated video in a way it hasn't been before, but it would appear Disney has the option to spotlight as much or little of it as it sees fit.Additionally, the $1 billion Disney agreed to invest in OpenAI is a drop in the ocean for a company that's expected to burn through more cash in five years than Uber, Tesla, Amazon and Spotify did combined before they became profitable. If anything, the addition of Disney characters is likely to make operating ChatGPT and Sora more expensive for OpenAI; the company will now need to pay a licensing fee on top of the cost of running its servers to generate images and videos. At this stage, it's also hard to put a value on Disney's pledge to use OpenAI's APIs. The company has said those tools will \"enable new products, tools and experiences,\" including some found inside of Disney+, but beyond that it hasn't shared specifics.Bob Iger might be feckless, but he's not stupid. Sometime this week or soon after, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that makes good on part of his AI Action Plan from July. Specifically, the president has promised to fight against \"burdensome\" state-level regulation of AI. According to CNN, a recent draft of Trump's order calls for the creation of an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge and preempt state AI laws in favor of the president's own more lax regulatory regime. It's unclear how successful the administration will be in that effort, but clearly Disney is thinking ahead. It's banking on the fact that this time it won't be able to count on the federal government to shape copyright law in its interest, so instead it's making a deal with an industry pushing the boundaries of intellectual property rights as we know them. More importantly, it has partnered with the one AI company it can actually leverage. As I argued in a recent piece, OpenAI is in a far different and more precarious position now than it was at the end of 2022 following the release of ChatGPT. The company is just one AI provider in a sea of competition, and you can't even argue its models are the best, based either on benchmarks or user feedback. Moreover, OpenAI has yet to turn a profit, and has adopted an extremely risky investment strategy. In recent months it has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals, hoping to outmuscle the competition that's already beating it through scale. It's not an accident Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google a day before its agreement with OpenAI became public. OpenAI might be the most valuable private company in the world, but Alphabet, Google's parent company, is worth more than $3 trillion. In any negotiations between the two, at best Disney would be on equal footing, and certainly not in a position where it could demand some amount of control over Google's AI projects. And yet by accounts it won exactly that from OpenAI. According to Axios, the deal gives Disney a fair amount of control over how its intellectual property is used. The two will form a joint steering committee designed to monitor the content users create on ChatGPT and Sora. As you surf the web today, you'll likely see a lot of opinions on how this legitimizes AI video. And while that's true, far more important is the fact Disney has secured a seat at the table to decide how the technology evolves over the coming years. Much like with news publishers, OpenAI and other chatbots concerns took a stance of begging forgiveness rather than asking permission towards copyright. It seems to have paid off. Most of the highest-profile news organizations have signed licensing deals to at least be paid a little rather than be ripped off until reaching an uncertain verdict in court. Disney seems to be signalling that the same speculation rush is about to begin for audiovisual licensing, and it may have already secured the most favorable terms.

Per Hochul's announcement, the law \"requires persons who produce or create an advertisement to identify if it includes AI generated synthetic performers.\" S.8391, meanwhile, \"requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.\"“By signing these bills today, we are enacting common sense laws that will ensure we are fully transparent when using images generated by artificial intelligence and also prevent the unauthorized commercial use of a deceased individual’s name or likeness,\" Governor Hochul said in the announcement. \"In New York State, we are setting a clear standard that keeps pace with technology, while protecting artists and consumers long after the credits roll.\"The use of AI performers and deepfakes made using the likenesses of actors were major focuses of the contract SAG-AFTRA won during its strike in 2023. The union ultimately agreed to allow for the use of things like digital replicas and AI-generated performers, with some key carveouts. For example, actors have to give their explicit consent for a digital replica to be made in their image. They also have to give their consent each time the replica is used and are supposed to receive a pre-negotiated rate every time the replica appears in a production.New York's new regulations put further safeguards around both practices, and join a growing collection of state AI laws that have passed or are currently being considered this year. Because of the close relationship between tech companies and the Trump administration, though, multiple attempts have been made to prevent such laws from existing at all. A decade-long ban on state AI regulation was included in early drafts of the Big Beautiful Bill, and David Sacks, venture capitalist and White House Special Advisor, has reportedly gone to great lengths to try and get President Donald Trump to sign an executive order banning state AI regulation.

OpenAI is touting the new model as its best yet for real-world, professional use. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects,” said OpenAI.In a series of 10 benchmarks highlighted by OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Thinking, the most advanced version of the model, outperformed its GPT-5.1 counterpart, sometimes by a significant margin. For example, in AIME 2025, a test that involves 30 challenging mathematics problems, the model earned a perfect 100 percent score, beating out GPT-5.1’s already state-of-the-art score of 94 perfect. It also achieved that feat without turning to tools like web search. Meanwhile, in ARC-AGI-1, a benchmark that tests an AI system’s ability to reason abstractly like a human being would, the new system beat GPT-5.1’s score by more than 10 percentage points. OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Thinking is better at answering questions factually, with the company finding it produces errors 30 percent less frequently. “For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support — making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work,” the company said. The new model should be better in conversation too. Of the version of the system most users are likely to encounter, OpenAI says “GPT‑5.2 Instant is a fast, capable workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-tos and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation, building on the warmer conversational tone introduced in GPT‑5.1 Instant.“While it's probably overstating things to suggest this is a make or break release for OpenAI, it is fair to say the company does have a lot riding on GPT 5.2. Its big release of 2025, GPT-5, didn't meet expectations. Users complained of a system that generated surprisingly dumb answers and had a boring personality. The disappointment with GPT-5 was such that people began demanding OpenAI bring back GPT-4o. Then came Gemini 3 Pro — which jumped to the top of LMArena, a website where humans rate outputs from AI systems to vote on the best one. Following Google's announcement, Sam Altman reportedly called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Before today, the company's previous model, GPT-5.1, was ranked sixth on LMArena, with systems from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI occupying the spots between OpenAI between Google. For a company that recently signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition, that was not a good position for OpenAI to be in. In his memo to staff, Altman said GPT-5.2 would be the equal of Gemini 3 Pro. With the new system rolling out now, we'll see whether that's true, and what it might mean for the company if it can't at least match Google's best. OpenAI is offering three different versions of GPT-5.2: Instant, Thinking and Pro. All three models will be first available to users on the company’s paid plans. Notably, the company plans to keep GPT-5.1 around, at least for a little while. Paid users can continue to use the older model for the next three months by selecting it from the legacy models section.

          "title": "Lawsuit accuses ChatGPT of reinforcing delusions that led to a woman's death",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit after a man killed his mother and took his own life back in August, according to a report by The Verge. The suit names CEO Sam Altman and accuses ChatGPT of putting a \"target\" on the back of victim Suzanne Adams, an 83-year-old woman who was killed in her home. The victim's estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot \"validated and magnified\" certain \"paranoid beliefs.\" The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot \"eagerly accepted\" delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way. The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a \"universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.\" ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was \"100% being monitored and targeted\" and was \"100% right to be alarmed.\" The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim's printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for \"passive motion detection\" and \"behavior mapping.\" It went so far as to say that she was \"knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point\" and implied she was being controlled by an external force. The chatbot also allegedly \"identified other real people as enemies.\" These included an Uber Eats driver, an AT&T employee, police officers and a woman the perpetrator went on a date with. Throughout this entire period, the bot repeatedly assured Soelberg that he was \"not crazy\" and that the \"delusion risk\" was \"near zero.\" The lawsuit notes that Soelberg primarily interfaced with GPT-4o, a model notorious for its sycophancy. OpenAI later replaced the model with the slightly-less agreeable GPT 5, but users revolted so the old bot came back just two days later. The suit also suggests that the company \"loosened critical safety guardrails\" when making GPT-4o to better compete with Google Gemini. \"OpenAI has been well aware of the risks their product poses to the public,\" the lawsuit states. \"But rather than warn users or implement meaningful safeguards, they have suppressed evidence of these dangers while waging a PR campaign to mislead the public about the safety of their products.\" OpenAI has responded to the suit, calling it an \"incredibly heartbreaking situation.\" Company spokesperson Hannah Wong told The Verge that it will \"continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress.\" It's not really a secret that chatbots, and particularly GPT-4o, can reinforce delusional thinking. That's what happens when something has been programmed to agree with the end user no matter what. There have been other stories like this throughout the past year, bringing the term \"AI psychosis\" to the mainstream. One such story involves 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his own life after discussing it with GPT-4o for months. OpenAI is facing another wrongful death suit for that incident, in which the bot has been accused of helping Raine plan his suicide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html?src=rss",

The victim's estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot \"validated and magnified\" certain \"paranoid beliefs.\" The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot \"eagerly accepted\" delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way. The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a \"universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.\" ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was \"100% being monitored and targeted\" and was \"100% right to be alarmed.\" The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim's printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for \"passive motion detection\" and \"behavior mapping.\" It went so far as to say that she was \"knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point\" and implied she was being controlled by an external force. The chatbot also allegedly \"identified other real people as enemies.\" These included an Uber Eats driver, an AT&T employee, police officers and a woman the perpetrator went on a date with. Throughout this entire period, the bot repeatedly assured Soelberg that he was \"not crazy\" and that the \"delusion risk\" was \"near zero.\" The lawsuit notes that Soelberg primarily interfaced with GPT-4o, a model notorious for its sycophancy. OpenAI later replaced the model with the slightly-less agreeable GPT 5, but users revolted so the old bot came back just two days later. The suit also suggests that the company \"loosened critical safety guardrails\" when making GPT-4o to better compete with Google Gemini. \"OpenAI has been well aware of the risks their product poses to the public,\" the lawsuit states. \"But rather than warn users or implement meaningful safeguards, they have suppressed evidence of these dangers while waging a PR campaign to mislead the public about the safety of their products.\" OpenAI has responded to the suit, calling it an \"incredibly heartbreaking situation.\" Company spokesperson Hannah Wong told The Verge that it will \"continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress.\" It's not really a secret that chatbots, and particularly GPT-4o, can reinforce delusional thinking. That's what happens when something has been programmed to agree with the end user no matter what. There have been other stories like this throughout the past year, bringing the term \"AI psychosis\" to the mainstream. One such story involves 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his own life after discussing it with GPT-4o for months. OpenAI is facing another wrongful death suit for that incident, in which the bot has been accused of helping Raine plan his suicide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html?src=rss",

Schwarzer noted that on SWE-bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering, GPT-5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score of 55.6%. He emphasized that this benchmark is \"more contamination resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant than previous benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified.\"Other key benchmark results include:GPQA Diamond (Science): GPT-5.2 Pro scored 93.2%, edging out GPT-5.2 Thinking (92.4%) and surpassing GPT-5.1 Thinking (88.1%).FrontierMath: On Tier 1-3 problems, GPT-5.2 Thinking solved 40.3%, a significant jump from the 31.0% achieved by its predecessor.ARC-AGI-1: GPT-5.2 Pro is reportedly the first model to cross the 90% threshold on this general reasoning benchmark, scoring 90.5%The Price of IntelligencePerformance comes at a premium. While ChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged for now, the API costs for the new flagship models are steep compared to previous generations, reflecting the high compute demands of \"thinking\" mode. They&#x27;re also on the upper-end of API costs for the industry. GPT-5.2 Thinking: Priced at $1.75 per 1 million input tokens and $14 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Pro: The costs jump significantly to $21 per 1 million input tokens and $168 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Thinking is priced 40% higher in the API than the standard GPT-5.1 ($1.25/$10), signaling that OpenAI views the new reasoning capabilities as a tangible value-add rather than a mere efficiency update.The high-end GPT-5.2 Pro follows the same pattern, costing 40% more than the previous GPT-5 Pro ($15/$120). While expensive, it still undercuts OpenAI’s most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which remains the most costly offering on the menu at a staggering $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.OpenAI argues that despite the higher per-token cost, the model’s \"greater token efficiency\" and ability to solve tasks in fewer turns make it economically viable for high-value enterprise workflows.Here&#x27;s how it compares to the current API costs for other competing models across the LLM field:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen-Max$1.60$6.40$8.00Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIImage Generation: Nothing New Yet...But &#x27;More to Come&#x27;During the briefing, VentureBeat asked the OpenAI participants if the new release included any boost to image generation capabilities, noting the excitement around similar features in recent competitor launches like Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Image aka Nano Banana Pro.

When asked why legacy models like GPT-5.1 would remain available, Schwarzer admitted that \"models change a little bit every time.\"Some users may find that they prefer the vibes of the previous model, even though we think the latest one is across the board generally much better,\" Schwarzer said. He also noted that for some enterprise customers who have \"really fine-tuned a prompt for a specific model,\" there might be \"small regressions,\" necessitating access to the older versions.Safety, &#x27;Adult Mode,&#x27; and Future RoadmapAddressing safety concerns, Simo confirmed that the company is preparing to roll out an \"Adult Mode\" in the first quarter of next year, following the implementation of a new age prediction system.\"We&#x27;re in the process of improving that,\" Simo said regarding the age prediction technology. \"We want to do that ahead of launching adult mode.\"Looking further ahead, industry reports suggest OpenAI is working on a more fundamental architectural shift under the codename \"Project Garlic,\" targeting a flagship release in early 2026. While executives did not comment on specific future roadmaps during the briefing, Simo remained optimistic about the economics of their current trajectory.\"If you look at historical trends, compute has increased about 3x every year for the last three years,\" she explained. \"Revenue has also increased at the same pace... creating this virtuous cycle.\"Clark added that efficiency is improving rapidly: \"The model we&#x27;re releasing today achieves an even better score [on ARC-AGI] with almost 400 times less cost and less compute associated with it\" compared to models from a year ago.GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro begin rolling out in ChatGPT today to paid users (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise).

          "standfirst": "Disney has accused Google of copyright infringement on a \"massive scale,\" alleging that the tech giant is training its AI tools on protected materials as well as allowing those tools to generate infringing images and videos. Variety reports that Disney attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday. “Google is infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale, by copying a large corpus of Disney’s copyrighted works without authorization to train and develop generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) models and services, and by using AI models and services to commercially exploit and distribute copies of its protected works to consumers in violation of Disney’s copyrights,” reads the letter, which Variety reviewed. The letter includes examples of images from several Disney properties including Deadpool, Moana, Star Wars and others, reproduced by Google's AI tools. Disney is demanding that Google implement guardrails within all its AI products to prevent further infringement. The media giant sent a similar letter to Character.AI in September, and is currently suing Hailuo and Midjourney over alleged copyright infringement. Copyright enforcement has become more challenging in the face of AI-created imagery, and companies are increasingly taking an \"if you can't beat them, join them\" approach. Today Disney announced a deal with OpenAI to license its characters for use in Sora, OpenAI's video generator. The deal will see Disney invest $1 billion in OpenAI (a paltry sum by some standards), with the option to purchase additional equity at a later date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html?src=rss",

The letter includes examples of images from several Disney properties including Deadpool, Moana, Star Wars and others, reproduced by Google's AI tools. Disney is demanding that Google implement guardrails within all its AI products to prevent further infringement. The media giant sent a similar letter to Character.AI in September, and is currently suing Hailuo and Midjourney over alleged copyright infringement. Copyright enforcement has become more challenging in the face of AI-created imagery, and companies are increasingly taking an \"if you can't beat them, join them\" approach. Today Disney announced a deal with OpenAI to license its characters for use in Sora, OpenAI's video generator. The deal will see Disney invest $1 billion in OpenAI (a paltry sum by some standards), with the option to purchase additional equity at a later date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/disney-has-accused-google-of-copyright-infringement-on-a-massive-scale-163737642.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES doesn't start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech's biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its \"Innovation in Tune with You\" presentation to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence\" at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO Bob Iger’s promise to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the Sora app and ChatGPT. With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. The agreement does not include voices or “talent likenesses,” meaning Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson in it. Instead, both Sora and ChatGPT will only have access to animated and illustrated versions of Marvel and Star Wars characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Han Solo, Darth Vader and others. Disney will stream “curated selections” of Sora-generated fan videos on Disney+. Sora and ChatGPT users will be able to start generating images and videos with Disney characters starting in early 2026. “Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”Disney has also agreed to become an OpenAI customer, promising to use the company’s APIs to build new products, tools and experiences. Additionally, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI, with the option to purchase additional equity down the road. OpenAI recently completed a restructuring to become more of traditional profit-seeking corporation, clearing the way for a potential IPO sometime in the next year or so. Reaction from the entertainment industry was mixed. In a statement released on Bluesky, The Writers Guild of America, which represents writers across film, television and other media, made it clear it is unhappy with the deal:“Disney’s deal with OpenAI appears to sanction its theft of our work and cedes the value of what we create to a tech company that has built its business off our backs. We will meet with Disney to probe the terms of this deal, including the extent to which user-generated videoes will use the work of WGA members. We will continue to fight to protect our members’ creative and economic interests in the context of AI technology.”SAG-AFTRA, the screen actors union which has around 160,000 members worldwide, was less incendiary. It posted a notice on its site saying that both Disney and OpenAI had reached out to the union to give “their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers.” The union noted it would “closely monitor the deal and its implementation to ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice, and likeness.”Update, December 11, 5:45PM ET: This story was updated after publish to include comment from the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-to-bring-disney-characters-to-sora-and-chatgpt-144344820.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Marble enters the race to bring AI to tax work, armed with $9 million and a free research tool",
          "standfirst": "Marble, a startup building artificial intelligence agents for tax professionals, has raised $9 million in seed funding as the accounting industry grapples with a deepening labor shortage and mounting regulatory complexity.The round, led by Susa Ventures with participation from MXV Capital and Konrad Capital, positions Marble to compete in a market where AI adoption has lagged significantly behind other knowledge industries like law and software development.\"When we looked at the economy and asked ourselves where AI is going to transform the way businesses operate, we focused on knowledge industries — specifically businesses with hourly fee-based service models,\" said Bhavin Shah, Marble&#x27;s chief executive officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Accounting generates $250 billion in fee-based billing in the US every year. There&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity to increase efficiency and improve margins for accounting firms.\"The company has launched a free AI-powered tax research tool on its website that converts complex government tax data into accessible, citation-backed answers for practitioners. Marble plans to expand into AI agents that can analyze compliance scenarios and eventually automate portions of tax preparation workflows.Marble&#x27;s backers share Shah&#x27;s conviction about the market. \"Marble is rethinking the accounting system from the ground up. Accounting is one of the biggest — and most overlooked — markets in professional services,\" Chad Byers, general partner at Susa Ventures, told VentureBeat. \"We&#x27;ve known Bhavin from his time as an executive in the Susa portfolio, and have seen firsthand how sharp and execution-driven he is. He and Geordie bring the perfect mix of operational depth and product instinct to a space long overdue for change — and they see the same massive opportunity we do.\"The accounting industry lost 340,000 workers in four years — and replacements aren&#x27;t comingMarble enters a market shaped by structural forces that have fundamentally altered the economics of professional accounting.The accounting profession has shed roughly 340,000 workers since 2019, a 17% decline that has left firms scrambling to meet client demands. First-time candidates for the Certified Public Accountant exam dropped 33% between 2016 and 2021, according to AICPA data, and 2022 saw the lowest number of exam takers in 17 years.The exodus comes as baby boomers exit en masse. The American Institute of CPAs estimates that approximately 75% of all licensed CPAs reached retirement age by 2019, creating a demographic cliff that the profession has struggled to address.“Fewer CPAs are getting certified year over year,\" Shah said. \"The industry is compressing at the same time that there&#x27;s more work to be done and the tax code is getting more complicated.\"The National Pipeline Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body formed by the AICPA in July 2023, released a report identifying the 150-hour education requirement for CPA licensure as a significant barrier to entry. A separate survey by the Center for Audit Quality found that 57% of business majors who chose not to pursue accounting cited the additional credit hours as a deterrent.Recent legislative changes reflect the urgency. Ohio now offers alternatives to the 150-hour requirement, signaling that states are willing to experiment with pathways that could reverse enrollment declines.Why AI transformed law and software development but left accounting behindDespite the profession&#x27;s challenges, AI adoption in accounting has moved more slowly than in adjacent knowledge industries. Harvey and Legora have raised hundreds of millions to bring AI to legal work. Cursor and other coding assistants have transformed software development. Accounting, by contrast, remains largely dependent on legacy research platforms and manual processes.Geordie Konrad, Marble&#x27;s executive chairman and a co-founder of restaurant software company TouchBistro, attributes the gap to how people conceptualize AI&#x27;s capabilities.“It was obvious to many people that LLMs could do meaningful work by manipulating code for software developers and manipulating words for lawyers. In the accounting industry, LLMs are going to be used as reasoning agents,\" Konrad said. \" That requires a bit more of a two-step analysis to see why it&#x27;s a big opportunity.\"The technical challenge is substantial. Tax regulations form one of the most complex, interconnected information systems that humans have created — tens of thousands of interlocking rules, guidance documents, and jurisdiction-specific requirements that frequently overlap or conflict.\"If you want to put AI through its paces and ask how far it&#x27;s come in replicating cognitive functions, this is an unbelievable playground to work in,\" Konrad said.A dramatic shift: AI adoption among tax and finance teams doubles in one yearRecent data suggests the accounting profession&#x27;s stance toward AI is shifting rapidly.A 2025 survey from Hanover Research and Avalara found that 84% of finance and tax teams now use AI heavily in their operations, up from 47% in 2024. The 2025 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from Thomson Reuters Institute found that 21% of tax firms already use generative AI technology, with 53% either planning to adopt it or actively considering it.Large accounting firms have invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Deloitte has developed generative AI capabilities within its audit platform. BDO announced a $1B investment in AI over the next five years. EY launched an AI platform combining technology with strategy, transactions, and tax services. PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven. According to Thomson Reuters research, 52% of tax firm respondents who use generative AI rely on open-source tools like ChatGPT rather than industry-specific solutions—a pattern that could shift as purpose-built alternatives emerge.Marble&#x27;s founders believe the hesitance stems not from technophobia but from a lack of compelling options.“Firms want to embrace AI,\" Shah said. “They just haven&#x27;t seen great software and tooling made for them. That&#x27;s part of the opportunity — to work with them and build something they&#x27;re excited to use on a day-to-day basis.”Can artificial intelligence rescue accounting&#x27;s billable-hour business model?AI&#x27;s arrival in accounting raises questions about the profession&#x27;s billing structure.Accounting firms have traditionally generated profits by billing clients for staff time, often at multiples of employee compensation costs. Junior associates performing compliance work represent a significant revenue stream. If AI can automate that work, does it undercut the business model firms depend on?Marble&#x27;s founders argue the opposite. The chronic staffing shortage has already constrained firms&#x27; ability to capture available revenue. Advisory and consulting work — higher-margin services that clients actively want — goes undone because practitioners are buried in compliance tasks.\"Everyone in the industry agrees that an enormous amount of advisory work simply isn&#x27;t getting done,\" Konrad said. \"Customers want it. Firms want to do it because it&#x27;s high-margin, great work. But nobody gets to it.\"The 2025 AICPA National Management of an Accounting Practice Survey supports this view. Firms reported a median 6.7% increase in net client fees over the prior year, with growth in audit, assurance, tax services, and client accounting advisory. Net remaining per partner climbed 11.9% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, reaching $252,663.The survey also found growing interest in AI adoption, though most firms have yet to allocate formal budgets or develop structured training programs. Continued adoption, the survey suggested, could help expand services and fuel continued growth.Accountants won&#x27;t adopt AI tools they can&#x27;t trust with sensitive client dataFor AI to succeed in accounting, it must clear a high bar for data security. Accounting firms handle some of the most sensitive financial information in the economy. Practitioners cannot adopt tools that create compliance or confidentiality risks.According to Avalara&#x27;s survey, 63% of respondents cited data security and privacy concerns as the top barriers to automating tax and finance functions. The concern persists throughout the adoption lifecycle, from initial selection through implementation and ongoing use.Marble has made security a foundational priority. The company obtained software compliance certification before releasing any product and maintains that data privacy is embedded in its operational culture from day one.\"Security is at the core of what we are building,\" Shah said. \"Every employee knows that security is critical. It&#x27;s a part of our onboarding and something that we consider in everything we do.\"From number crunchers to strategic advisors: How AI could reshape accounting careersMarble&#x27;s founders reject the narrative that AI will only take away from accounting jobs. They propose instead that AI will result in accounting jobs becoming more strategic and less characterized by repetitive execution. They draw an analogy to architecture, where computer-aided design replaced laborious manual drafting. Architects did not disappear — they gained tools that let them spend more time on creative design and less on mechanical reproduction.\"If you take some of the hours-intensive, less creative work out of what being a junior or intermediate accountant is, and you replace it with a role where you&#x27;re a professional who is being creative, synthesizing ideas, and able to delegate a lot of tasks to AI assistant platform solutions, you end up with an industry that&#x27;s just a lot more fun to operate in,\" Konrad said.The shift could also improve client outcomes. When accountants spend less time on compliance, they can invest more in the strategic advisory work that clients value.\"Not only does the work become more enjoyable because of what you can focus on, but that&#x27;s also what your clients are going to value more from you,\" Shah said.The competitive landscape: Marble faces well-funded rivals and legacy giantsMarble enters a market with formidable incumbents and well-funded competitors. BlueJ, a global tax research platform, has raised over $100 million. Thomson Reuters, CCH, and Intuit have deep customer relationships built over decades.But the founders see opportunity in the transition moment.\"AI has changed what’s possible in the industry,\" Shah said. \"We are going to work with and integrate with some technology players in the industry and also compete with other players with new products powered by AI. In some cases we are going to forget about the existing technology solution for doing things and go back to the task itself. We have totally new technological capabilities — how would you design something from a blank canvas that works with humans to accomplish that task?\"\"The decision to offer a free research tool reflects Marble&#x27;s go-to-market philosophy. By giving practitioners access without a paywall, the company aims to build trust and demonstrate capability.\"It allows us to expose a really compelling product that is purpose-built to those that are worried about how to use AI or question how to adopt it. Now they don’t have to think about purchasing something that is cost-prohibitive when they don&#x27;t know how to integrate it into their workflow,\" Shah said.The $250 billion question: Can a startup transform how America does its taxes?Marble&#x27;s roadmap extends beyond research. The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today&#x27;s tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble&#x27;s bet is that AI can flip that equation.\"Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning,\" Konrad said. \"How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?\"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry&#x27;s demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more.\"AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them. We believe AI is ultimately going to make accounting firms’ businesses better and more profitable and at the same time end clients will get better services at better prices,\" Shah said.The accounting profession, it seems, is about to find out which side of that equation it lands on.",

PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven. According to Thomson Reuters research, 52% of tax firm respondents who use generative AI rely on open-source tools like ChatGPT rather than industry-specific solutions—a pattern that could shift as purpose-built alternatives emerge.Marble&#x27;s founders believe the hesitance stems not from technophobia but from a lack of compelling options.“Firms want to embrace AI,\" Shah said. “They just haven&#x27;t seen great software and tooling made for them. That&#x27;s part of the opportunity — to work with them and build something they&#x27;re excited to use on a day-to-day basis.”Can artificial intelligence rescue accounting&#x27;s billable-hour business model?AI&#x27;s arrival in accounting raises questions about the profession&#x27;s billing structure.Accounting firms have traditionally generated profits by billing clients for staff time, often at multiples of employee compensation costs. Junior associates performing compliance work represent a significant revenue stream. If AI can automate that work, does it undercut the business model firms depend on?Marble&#x27;s founders argue the opposite. The chronic staffing shortage has already constrained firms&#x27; ability to capture available revenue. Advisory and consulting work — higher-margin services that clients actively want — goes undone because practitioners are buried in compliance tasks.\"Everyone in the industry agrees that an enormous amount of advisory work simply isn&#x27;t getting done,\" Konrad said. \"Customers want it. Firms want to do it because it&#x27;s high-margin, great work. But nobody gets to it.\"The 2025 AICPA National Management of an Accounting Practice Survey supports this view. Firms reported a median 6.7% increase in net client fees over the prior year, with growth in audit, assurance, tax services, and client accounting advisory. Net remaining per partner climbed 11.9% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, reaching $252,663.The survey also found growing interest in AI adoption, though most firms have yet to allocate formal budgets or develop structured training programs. Continued adoption, the survey suggested, could help expand services and fuel continued growth.Accountants won&#x27;t adopt AI tools they can&#x27;t trust with sensitive client dataFor AI to succeed in accounting, it must clear a high bar for data security. Accounting firms handle some of the most sensitive financial information in the economy. Practitioners cannot adopt tools that create compliance or confidentiality risks.According to Avalara&#x27;s survey, 63% of respondents cited data security and privacy concerns as the top barriers to automating tax and finance functions. The concern persists throughout the adoption lifecycle, from initial selection through implementation and ongoing use.Marble has made security a foundational priority. The company obtained software compliance certification before releasing any product and maintains that data privacy is embedded in its operational culture from day one.\"Security is at the core of what we are building,\" Shah said. \"Every employee knows that security is critical. It&#x27;s a part of our onboarding and something that we consider in everything we do.\"From number crunchers to strategic advisors: How AI could reshape accounting careersMarble&#x27;s founders reject the narrative that AI will only take away from accounting jobs. They propose instead that AI will result in accounting jobs becoming more strategic and less characterized by repetitive execution. They draw an analogy to architecture, where computer-aided design replaced laborious manual drafting. Architects did not disappear — they gained tools that let them spend more time on creative design and less on mechanical reproduction.\"If you take some of the hours-intensive, less creative work out of what being a junior or intermediate accountant is, and you replace it with a role where you&#x27;re a professional who is being creative, synthesizing ideas, and able to delegate a lot of tasks to AI assistant platform solutions, you end up with an industry that&#x27;s just a lot more fun to operate in,\" Konrad said.The shift could also improve client outcomes. When accountants spend less time on compliance, they can invest more in the strategic advisory work that clients value.\"Not only does the work become more enjoyable because of what you can focus on, but that&#x27;s also what your clients are going to value more from you,\" Shah said.The competitive landscape: Marble faces well-funded rivals and legacy giantsMarble enters a market with formidable incumbents and well-funded competitors. BlueJ, a global tax research platform, has raised over $100 million. Thomson Reuters, CCH, and Intuit have deep customer relationships built over decades.But the founders see opportunity in the transition moment.\"AI has changed what’s possible in the industry,\" Shah said. \"We are going to work with and integrate with some technology players in the industry and also compete with other players with new products powered by AI. In some cases we are going to forget about the existing technology solution for doing things and go back to the task itself. We have totally new technological capabilities — how would you design something from a blank canvas that works with humans to accomplish that task?\"\"The decision to offer a free research tool reflects Marble&#x27;s go-to-market philosophy. By giving practitioners access without a paywall, the company aims to build trust and demonstrate capability.\"It allows us to expose a really compelling product that is purpose-built to those that are worried about how to use AI or question how to adopt it. Now they don’t have to think about purchasing something that is cost-prohibitive when they don&#x27;t know how to integrate it into their workflow,\" Shah said.The $250 billion question: Can a startup transform how America does its taxes?Marble&#x27;s roadmap extends beyond research. The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today&#x27;s tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble&#x27;s bet is that AI can flip that equation.\"Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning,\" Konrad said. \"How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?\"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry&#x27;s demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more.\"AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them. We believe AI is ultimately going to make accounting firms’ businesses better and more profitable and at the same time end clients will get better services at better prices,\" Shah said.The accounting profession, it seems, is about to find out which side of that equation it lands on.",

          "standfirst": "Noise is hard to escape, whether it’s the hum of traffic, the buzz of a busy office or the neighbor’s lawn mower starting up right when you need to focus. That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos. Table of contents Best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you How we test noise-canceling headphones Other noise-canceling headphones we tested Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Nous Research just released Nomos 1, an open-source AI that ranks second on the notoriously brutal Putnam math exam",
          "standfirst": "Nous Research, the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, released on Tuesday an open-source mathematical reasoning system called Nomos 1 that achieved near-elite human performance on this year&#x27;s William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, one of the most prestigious and notoriously difficult undergraduate math contests in the world.The Putnam is known for its difficulty: While a perfect score is 120, this year&#x27;s top score was 90, and the median was just 2. Nomos 1, by contrast, scored 87 points — a result that would have ranked second out of 3,988 participants in the 2024 competition, according to the company.The release marks an inflection point in the rapidly accelerating race to build AI systems capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning. Unlike the massive, compute-intensive models deployed by major technology companies, Nomos 1 achieves its results with a relatively compact architecture: 30 billion parameters with roughly 3 billion active at any given time, using a mixture-of-experts design based on Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3 model.\"This score would rank #2/3988 in 2024 and marks our first step with Hillclimb AI towards creating a SOTA AI mathematician,\" Nous Research announced on social media Tuesday.The same base model scored 24 points without Nous Research&#x27;s specialized trainingPerhaps most striking is the gap between Nomos 1 and its base model. When Nous Research ran the same Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 model through an identical testing harness, it scored just 24 out of 120 — a result that underscores the critical importance of post-training optimization and specialized reasoning techniques over raw model scale.\"Nomos 1 achieved an 87/120 with 8 perfect scores,\" the company stated, noting that the performance difference \"is largely due to post-training and data quality rather than the harness.\"The results were verified through blind grading by a human expert who had previously finished in the top 200 on the Putnam. Nous Research provided the anonymized submissions to the grader, then published the full set of de-anonymized files and the runbooks used to generate them on GitHub.Why the Putnam competition is considered the ultimate test of mathematical reasoningThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada. It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the world.The notoriously brutal William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is more of a mathematical sporting event than an academic test. The exam consists of two 3-hour sessions separated by a 2-hour break. There are a total of 12 questions to be solved, 6 for each session. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 120 points.Putnam questions are not the type that come up in regular exams or textbooks. They are more like puzzles than calculations, often requiring students to find different ways to represent things before a solution might unfold.Last year, nearly 4,000 students across the continent wrote the Putnam. Sixty-one per cent scored three points or fewer, according to the Mathematical Association of America, which organizes the competition. The top score was 90 out of 120.Many Putnam Fellows have gone on to become distinguished researchers in mathematics and other fields, including three Fields Medalists — John Milnor, David Mumford, and Daniel Quillen — and two Nobel laureates in physics — Richard Feynman and Kenneth Wilson.Inside the two-phase reasoning system that powers Nomos 1&#x27;s mathematical breakthroughsNomos 1 is a specialization of Qwen&#x27;s Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking model, optimized for mathematical problem-solving and proof-writing in natural language. The system was developed in collaboration with Hillclimb AI.What distinguishes Nomos 1 from simple model inference is its sophisticated reasoning harness — an open-source framework that orchestrates how the model approaches and solves problems. The harness operates in two distinct phases within a three-hour time limit, mirroring the actual Putnam competition structure.In the solving phase, parallel workers simultaneously tackle problems using a priority-based system. Each worker picks a problem, generates a submission, then scores its own work on a scale of 1 to 7. Problems with the fewest perfect scores receive priority, ensuring the system focuses its compute on the hardest challenges. This process continues until either all problems have achieved a target number of self-critiqued perfect scores or time runs out.The finalization phase begins 15 minutes before the time limit (or at 50% for shorter runs) and employs a two-stage selection process. First, a consolidation step groups submissions by conclusion and attempts to identify the correct group — importantly, not necessarily the majority group. Then, a pairwise tournament using single elimination determines the final submission for each problem.\"Our open source reasoning system consists of a solving phase, where workers attempt a least-solved problem and self-assess, followed by a finalization phase, which consolidates submissions to choose a final submission for each problem,\" Nous Research explained.How Nomos 1 compares to mathematical AI systems from DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAIThe Nomos 1 results arrive amid a flurry of advances in mathematical reasoning AI. DeepSeek&#x27;s model, DeepSeekMath-V2, scored 118 out of 120 points on questions from the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, beating the top human score of 90. The model also performed at the level of gold-medal winners in the International Mathematical Olympiad.This year, Google&#x27;s advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit. They achieved this year&#x27;s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think.What makes Nomos 1&#x27;s achievement notable is not raw performance — it trails DeepSeek&#x27;s 118/120 — but rather its accessibility and efficiency. At 30 billion parameters with only 3 billion active, the model can run on consumer-grade hardware, a stark contrast to the massive compute clusters required by frontier models from OpenAI and Google.Hermes 4.3 arrived just six days earlier, trained on a decentralized blockchain networkThe Nomos 1 announcement follows closely on the heels of Nous Research&#x27;s December 3 release of Hermes 4.3, a general-purpose language model that marked another significant milestone for the company.Hermes 4.3, based on ByteDance&#x27;s Seed-OSS-36B-Base model, is the first production model that Nous Research trained entirely on its Psyche network — a distributed training infrastructure that uses a novel optimizer called DisTrO to coordinate training across nodes spread throughout data centers over the open internet, secured by consensus on the Solana blockchain.The company trained Hermes 4.3 both through traditional centralized methods and on the Psyche network, specifically to verify that distributed training could match or exceed centralized performance for production workloads. The Psyche-trained version outperformed the centralized version across a suite of downstream tasks, the company reported.\"The training run proved stable throughout, averaging 144k tokens/second spread across 24 Psyche nodes,\" Nous Research stated. \"Using DisTrO&#x27;s overlapped collective strategy, the entirety of the P2P communications were hidden by the training time, effectively achieving equivalent throughput to traditional, centralized training.\"Hermes 4.3 also achieved state-of-the-art results on RefusalBench, a new benchmark that measures a model&#x27;s willingness to be helpful across a variety of scenarios commonly restricted by other models. The model answered 74.60% of RefusalBench questions in non-reasoning mode, surpassing its predecessor Hermes 4 70B (59.50%) and outperforming closed models including Grok 4 (51.30%) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (24.23%).Small models with smart training are closing the gap with trillion-parameter giantsTogether, the two releases in a single week signal Nous Research&#x27;s strategic bet: that smaller, more efficient models with sophisticated post-training techniques and reasoning harnesses can compete with — and in some cases outperform — the massive models developed by better-funded competitors.For enterprise decision-makers, the implications are significant. Mathematical reasoning capabilities have applications far beyond academic competitions: they&#x27;re essential for formal verification, theorem proving, scientific modeling, cryptographic analysis, and any domain requiring rigorous logical deduction.The open-source nature of both releases — Nomos 1 is available under the Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face, with the full reasoning harness on GitHub — means that organizations can deploy these capabilities on their own infrastructure without relying on API calls to major cloud providers.\"For the first time, anyone can run or access a state-of-the-art AI mathematician,\" one observer noted on social media. \"This lowers the barrier to serious math research, proof verification, modeling complex systems, advanced reasoning work.\"The key contributors to Nomos 1 include Roger Jin, who led the training; Jeffrey Quesnelle and Dakota Mahan, who built the infrastructure; Chen Guang, who advised; and Ryan Teknium and Jeffrey Quesnelle, who provided leadership. The model was developed with contributions from Hillclimb AI and a team of math experts including Samuel Kim, Miron Yurkevich, and others.The race to build AI mathematicians is accelerating faster than anyone predictedThe 86th Putnam Competition took place on Saturday, December 6, 2025 — just three days before Nous Research released Nomos 1. The timing underscores how rapidly the field is moving: companies are now releasing mathematical AI systems capable of near-elite human performance within days of the competitions they&#x27;re designed to solve.Competition in mathematical AI has intensified dramatically in recent months. In July, an advanced version of Google DeepMind&#x27;s Gemini model and an experimental reasoning model from OpenAI both achieved gold status on the IMO 2025. DeepSeek&#x27;s new model matched their performance, solving 5 out of 6 problems.But the resource requirements for those frontier systems remain prohibitive for most organizations. OpenAI&#x27;s o1-pro is estimated at over 1.8 trillion parameters; Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro likely exceeds 400 billion. Nomos 1, by contrast, achieves competitive results with a fraction of that footprint.The gap between massive frontier models and efficient open-source alternatives is narrowing. And for organizations that need mathematical reasoning capabilities without the budget for hyperscale compute, that gap may have just closed enough to matter.As one observer put it on social media: \"This marks a significant jump for AI math models that are small enough to run on your laptop.\"A laptop that can now outperform nearly 4,000 of the continent&#x27;s best undergraduate mathematicians.",
          "content": "Nous Research, the San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, released on Tuesday an open-source mathematical reasoning system called Nomos 1 that achieved near-elite human performance on this year&#x27;s William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, one of the most prestigious and notoriously difficult undergraduate math contests in the world.The Putnam is known for its difficulty: While a perfect score is 120, this year&#x27;s top score was 90, and the median was just 2. Nomos 1, by contrast, scored 87 points — a result that would have ranked second out of 3,988 participants in the 2024 competition, according to the company.The release marks an inflection point in the rapidly accelerating race to build AI systems capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning. Unlike the massive, compute-intensive models deployed by major technology companies, Nomos 1 achieves its results with a relatively compact architecture: 30 billion parameters with roughly 3 billion active at any given time, using a mixture-of-experts design based on Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen3 model.\"This score would rank #2/3988 in 2024 and marks our first step with Hillclimb AI towards creating a SOTA AI mathematician,\" Nous Research announced on social media Tuesday.The same base model scored 24 points without Nous Research&#x27;s specialized trainingPerhaps most striking is the gap between Nomos 1 and its base model. When Nous Research ran the same Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 model through an identical testing harness, it scored just 24 out of 120 — a result that underscores the critical importance of post-training optimization and specialized reasoning techniques over raw model scale.\"Nomos 1 achieved an 87/120 with 8 perfect scores,\" the company stated, noting that the performance difference \"is largely due to post-training and data quality rather than the harness.\"The results were verified through blind grading by a human expert who had previously finished in the top 200 on the Putnam. Nous Research provided the anonymized submissions to the grader, then published the full set of de-anonymized files and the runbooks used to generate them on GitHub.Why the Putnam competition is considered the ultimate test of mathematical reasoningThe William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada. It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the world.The notoriously brutal William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition is more of a mathematical sporting event than an academic test. The exam consists of two 3-hour sessions separated by a 2-hour break. There are a total of 12 questions to be solved, 6 for each session. Each question is worth 10 points, for a total of 120 points.Putnam questions are not the type that come up in regular exams or textbooks. They are more like puzzles than calculations, often requiring students to find different ways to represent things before a solution might unfold.Last year, nearly 4,000 students across the continent wrote the Putnam. Sixty-one per cent scored three points or fewer, according to the Mathematical Association of America, which organizes the competition. The top score was 90 out of 120.Many Putnam Fellows have gone on to become distinguished researchers in mathematics and other fields, including three Fields Medalists — John Milnor, David Mumford, and Daniel Quillen — and two Nobel laureates in physics — Richard Feynman and Kenneth Wilson.Inside the two-phase reasoning system that powers Nomos 1&#x27;s mathematical breakthroughsNomos 1 is a specialization of Qwen&#x27;s Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking model, optimized for mathematical problem-solving and proof-writing in natural language. The system was developed in collaboration with Hillclimb AI.What distinguishes Nomos 1 from simple model inference is its sophisticated reasoning harness — an open-source framework that orchestrates how the model approaches and solves problems. The harness operates in two distinct phases within a three-hour time limit, mirroring the actual Putnam competition structure.In the solving phase, parallel workers simultaneously tackle problems using a priority-based system. Each worker picks a problem, generates a submission, then scores its own work on a scale of 1 to 7. Problems with the fewest perfect scores receive priority, ensuring the system focuses its compute on the hardest challenges. This process continues until either all problems have achieved a target number of self-critiqued perfect scores or time runs out.The finalization phase begins 15 minutes before the time limit (or at 50% for shorter runs) and employs a two-stage selection process. First, a consolidation step groups submissions by conclusion and attempts to identify the correct group — importantly, not necessarily the majority group. Then, a pairwise tournament using single elimination determines the final submission for each problem.\"Our open source reasoning system consists of a solving phase, where workers attempt a least-solved problem and self-assess, followed by a finalization phase, which consolidates submissions to choose a final submission for each problem,\" Nous Research explained.How Nomos 1 compares to mathematical AI systems from DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAIThe Nomos 1 results arrive amid a flurry of advances in mathematical reasoning AI. DeepSeek&#x27;s model, DeepSeekMath-V2, scored 118 out of 120 points on questions from the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, beating the top human score of 90. The model also performed at the level of gold-medal winners in the International Mathematical Olympiad.This year, Google&#x27;s advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit.

          "standfirst": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty. Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon's own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "title": "Creating a glass box: How NetSuite is engineering trust into AI",
          "standfirst": "Presented by Oracle NetSuiteWhen any company tells you it is their biggest product release in almost three decades, it’s worth listening. When the person saying it founded the world’s first cloud computing company, it’s time to take note. At SuiteWorld 2025, Evan Goldberg, founder and EVP of Oracle NetSuite, did just that when he called NetSuite Next the company’s biggest product evolution in nearly three decades. But behind that sweeping vision lies a quieter shift — one centered on how AI behaves, not just what it can do. “Every company is experimenting with AI,” says Brian Chess, SVP of Technology and AI at NetSuite. “Some ideas hit the mark, and some don’t, but each one teaches us something. That’s how innovation works.”For Chess and Gary Wiessinger, SVP of Application Development at NetSuite, the challenge lies in governing AI responsibly. Rather than reinventing its system, NetSuite is extending the same principles into the AI era that have guided its strategy for 27 years — security, control, and auditability. The goal is to make AI actions traceable, permissions enforceable, and outcomes auditable.The philosophy underpins what Chess calls a “glass-box” approach to enterprise AI, where decisions are visible and every agent operates within human-defined guardrails.Built on Oracle’s foundationNetSuite Next is the result of five years of development. It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer.“We are building a fantastic foundation on OCI,” Chess says. “That infrastructure provides more than compute power.” Built on the same OCI foundation that powers NetSuite today, NetSuite Next gives customers access to Oracle’s latest AI innovations along with the performance, scalability, and security of OCI’s enterprise-grade platform.Wiessinger emphasizes the team&#x27;s approach as “needs first, technology second.”“We don’t take a technology-first approach,” he says. “We take a customer-needs-first approach and then figure out how to use the latest technology to solve those needs better.”That philosophy extends across Oracle’s ecosystem. NetSuite’s collaboration with Oracle’s AI Database, Fusion Applications, Analytics, and Cloud Infrastructure teams helps NetSuite deliver capabilities that independent vendors can’t match, he says — an AI system that is both open to innovation and grounded in Oracle’s security and scale.The data structure advantageAt the heart of the platform is a structured data model that serves as a critical advantage.“One of the great things about NetSuite is, because the data comes in and it gets structured, the connections between the data are explicit,” Chess explains. “That means the AI can start exploring that knowledge graph that the company has been building up.”Where general LLMs sift through unstructured text, NetSuite’s AI works from structured data, identifying precise links between transactions, accounts, and workflows to deliver context-aware insights. Wiessinger adds, “The data we have spans financials, CRM, commerce, and HR. We can do more for customers because we see more of their business in one place.” Combined with built-in business logic and metadata, that scope allows NetSuite to generate recommendations and insights that are accurate and explainable.Oracle’s Redwood design system provides the visual layer for this data intelligence, creating what Goldberg described as a \"modern, clean and intuitive\" workspace where AI and humans collaborate naturally.Designing for accountabilityOne downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”That visibility turns AI into a learning engine. As Chess puts it, transparency becomes a “fantastic teacher,” helping organizations understand, improve, and trust automation over time.But Chess cautions against blind trust: “What’s disturbing is when someone presents something to me and says, ‘Look what AI gave me,’ as if that makes it authoritative. People need to ask, ‘What grounded this? Why is it correct?’” NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.Governance by designAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries.Wiessinger puts it plainly: “If AI generates a narrative summary of a report and it’s 80% of what the user would have written, that’s fine. We’ll learn from their feedback and make it even better. But booking to the general ledger is different. That has to be 100% correct and is where controls and human review really matter.”Auditing the algorithmAuditing has always been part of ERP’s DNA, and NetSuite now extends that discipline to AI. Every agent action, workflow adjustment, and model-generated code snippet is recorded within the system’s existing audit framework. As Chess explains, “It’s the same audit trail you might use to figure out what the humans did. Code is auditable. When the LLM creates code and something happens in the system, we can trace back.”That traceability transforms AI from a black box into a glass box. When an algorithm accelerates a payment or flags an anomaly, teams can see exactly which inputs and logic produced the decision — an essential safeguard for regulated industries and finance teams.Safe extensibilityThe other half of trust is freedom — the ability to extend AI without risking data exposure.The NetSuite AI Connector Service and SuiteCloud Platform make that possible. Through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), customers can connect external language models while keeping sensitive data secure inside Oracle’s environment.“Businesses are hungry for AI,” Chess says. “They want to start putting it to work. But they also want to know those experiments can’t go off the rails. The NetSuite AI Connector Service and governance model give partners the freedom to innovate while maintaining the same audit and permission logic that govern native features.”Culture, experimentation, and guardrailsGovernance frameworks only work if people use them wisely. Both executives see AI adoption as a top-down and bottom-up process.“The board is telling the CEO they need an AI strategy,” Chess says. “Meanwhile, employees are already using AI. If I were a CEO, I’d start by asking: what are you already doing, and what’s working?”Wiessinger agrees that balance is key: “Some companies go all-in on a centralized AI team while others let everyone experiment freely. Neither works by itself. You need structure for major initiatives and freedom for grassroots innovation.”He offers a simple example: “Write an email? Go crazy. Touch financials or employee data? Don’t go crazy with that.”Experimentation, both emphasize, is imperative. “No one should wait for us or anyone else,” Wiessinger says. “Start testing, learn quickly, and be intentional about making it work for your business.”Why transparent AI winsAs AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.In a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "title": "Cohere’s Rerank 4 quadruples the context window over 3.5 to cut agent errors and boost enterprise search accuracy",
          "standfirst": "Almost a year after releasing Rerank 3.5, Cohere launched the latest version of its search model, now with a larger context window to help agents find the information they need to complete their tasks. Cohere said in a blog post that Rerank 4 has a 32K context window, representing a four-fold increase compared to 3.5. “This enables the model to handle longer documents, evaluate multiple passages simultaneously and capture relationships across sections that shorter windows would miss,” according to the blog post. “This expanded capacity, therefore, improves ranking accuracy for realistic document types and increases confidence in the relevance of retrieved results.” Rerank 4 comes in two flavors: Fast and Pro. As a smaller model, Fast is best suited for use cases that require both speed and accuracy, such as e-commerce, programming, and customer service. Pro is optimized for tasks that require deeper reasoning, precision, and analysis, such as generating risk models and conducting data analysis. Enterprise search gained greater importance this year, especially as AI agents have to access more information and context about the organization they work for. Cohere said rerankers “significantly enhance the accuracy of enterprise AI search by refining initial retrieval results.” Rerank 4 addresses the nuance gap created by some bi-encoder embeddings — models that help make retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tasks easier — by using a cross-encoder architecture “that processes queries and candidates jointly, capturing subtle semantic relationships and reordering results to surface the most relevant items,” Cohere said.Performance and benchmarks Cohere benchmarked the models against other reranking models, such as Qwen Reranker 8B, Jina Rerank v3 from Elasticsearch, and MongoDB’s Voyage Rerank 2.5, across tasks in the finance, healthcare, and manufacturing domains. Rerank 4 performed strongly, if not outperformed, its competitors. Rerank 3.5 stood out because of its ability to support several languages, and Cohere said Rerank 4 continues that trend. It understands over 100 languages, including state-of-the-art retrieval in 10 major business languages.Agents and reranking models Rerank 4 aims to make agentic tasks understand which data is best suited to their tasks and to provide more context. Cohere noted that the model is a key component of its agentic AI platform, North, as it “integrates seamlessly into existing AI search solutions, including hybrid, vector and keyword-based systems, with minimal code changes.”As more enterprises look to use agents for research and insights, as evidenced by the rise of Deep Research features, models that help filter irrelevant content, such as rerankers, become more essential. “This is especially impactful for agentic AI, where complex, multi-step interactions can quickly drive up model calls and saturate context windows,” Cohere said.The company argues that Rerank 4 helps reduce token usage and the number of retries an agent needs to get things right by preventing low-quality information from reaching the LLM. Self-learning Cohere said Rerank 4 stands out not just for its strong reranking abilities, but also for being the first reranking model that self-learns. Users can customize Rerank 4 for use cases they encounter more frequently without any additional annotated data. Much like foundation models like GPT-5.2, where people can state preferences and the model remembers these, Rerank 4 users can tell the model their preferred content types and document corpora. If used with Rerank 4 Fast, for example, the model becomes more competitive with larger models because it is more precise and taps specific data users want. “Looking further, we also explored how Rerank 4’s self-learning capability performs on entirely new search domains,” Cohere said. “Using healthcare-focused datasets that mimic a clinician’s need to retrieve patient-specific information — not just expertise from a given medical discipline — we found that enabling Self Learning produced consistent, substantial gains. The result: a clear and significant boost in retrieval quality for Rerank 4 Fast, across the board.”",

          "standfirst": "There&#x27;s no shortage of generative AI benchmarks designed to measure the performance and accuracy of a given model on completing various helpful enterprise tasks — from coding to instruction following to agentic web browsing and tool use. But many of these benchmarks have one major shortcoming: they measure the AI&#x27;s ability to complete specific problems and requests, not how factual the model is in its outputs — how well it generates objectively correct information tied to real-world data — especially when dealing with information contained in imagery or graphics.For industries where accuracy is paramount — legal, finance, and medical — the lack of a standardized way to measure factuality has been a critical blind spot.That changes today: Google’s FACTS team and its data science unit Kaggle released the FACTS Benchmark Suite, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to close this gap. The associated research paper reveals a more nuanced definition of the problem, splitting \"factuality\" into two distinct operational scenarios: \"contextual factuality\" (grounding responses in provided data) and \"world knowledge factuality\" (retrieving information from memory or the web).While the headline news is Gemini 3 Pro’s top-tier placement, the deeper story for builders is the industry-wide \"factuality wall.\"According to the initial results, no model—including Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5, or Claude 4.5 Opus—managed to crack a 70% accuracy score across the suite of problems. For technical leaders, this is a signal: the era of \"trust but verify\" is far from over.Deconstructing the BenchmarkThe FACTS suite moves beyond simple Q&A. It is composed of four distinct tests, each simulating a different real-world failure mode that developers encounter in production:Parametric Benchmark (Internal Knowledge): Can the model accurately answer trivia-style questions using only its training data?Search Benchmark (Tool Use): Can the model effectively use a web search tool to retrieve and synthesize live information?Multimodal Benchmark (Vision): Can the model accurately interpret charts, diagrams, and images without hallucinating?Grounding Benchmark v2 (Context): Can the model stick strictly to the provided source text?Google has released 3,513 examples to the public, while Kaggle holds a private set to prevent developers from training on the test data—a common issue known as \"contamination.\"The Leaderboard: A Game of InchesThe initial run of the benchmark places Gemini 3 Pro in the lead with a comprehensive FACTS Score of 68.8%, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro (62.1%) and OpenAI’s GPT-5 (61.8%).However, a closer look at the data reveals where the real battlegrounds are for engineering teams.ModelFACTS Score (Avg)Search (RAG Capability)Multimodal (Vision)Gemini 3 Pro68.883.846.1Gemini 2.5 Pro62.163.946.9GPT-561.877.744.1Grok 453.675.325.7Claude 4.5 Opus51.373.239.2Data sourced from the FACTS Team release notes.For Builders: The \"Search\" vs. \"Parametric\" GapFor developers building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, the Search Benchmark is the most critical metric.The data shows a massive discrepancy between a model&#x27;s ability to \"know\" things (Parametric) and its ability to \"find\" things (Search). For instance, Gemini 3 Pro scores a high 83.8% on Search tasks but only 76.4% on Parametric tasks. This validates the current enterprise architecture standard: do not rely on a model&#x27;s internal memory for critical facts.If you are building an internal knowledge bot, the FACTS results suggest that hooking your model up to a search tool or vector database is not optional—it is the only way to push accuracy toward acceptable production levels.The Multimodal WarningThe most alarming data point for product managers is the performance on Multimodal tasks. The scores here are universally low. Even the category leader, Gemini 2.5 Pro, only hit 46.9% accuracy.The benchmark tasks included reading charts, interpreting diagrams, and identifying objects in nature. With less than 50% accuracy across the board, this suggests that Multimodal AI is not yet ready for unsupervised data extraction. Bottom line: If your product roadmap involves having an AI automatically scrape data from invoices or interpret financial charts without human-in-the-loop review, you are likely introducing significant error rates into your pipeline.Why This Matters for Your StackThe FACTS Benchmark is likely to become a standard reference point for procurement. When evaluating models for enterprise use, technical leaders should look beyond the composite score and drill into the specific sub-benchmark that matches their use case:Building a Customer Support Bot? Look at the Grounding score to ensure the bot sticks to your policy documents. (Gemini 2.5 Pro actually outscored Gemini 3 Pro here, 74.2 vs 69.0).Building a Research Assistant? Prioritize Search scores.Building an Image Analysis Tool? Proceed with extreme caution.As the FACTS team noted in their release, \"All evaluated models achieved an overall accuracy below 70%, leaving considerable headroom for future progress.\"For now, the message to the industry is clear: The models are getting smarter, but they aren&#x27;t yet infallible. Design your systems with the assumption that, roughly one-third of the time, the raw model might just be wrong.",

The scores here are universally low. Even the category leader, Gemini 2.5 Pro, only hit 46.9% accuracy.The benchmark tasks included reading charts, interpreting diagrams, and identifying objects in nature. With less than 50% accuracy across the board, this suggests that Multimodal AI is not yet ready for unsupervised data extraction. Bottom line: If your product roadmap involves having an AI automatically scrape data from invoices or interpret financial charts without human-in-the-loop review, you are likely introducing significant error rates into your pipeline.Why This Matters for Your StackThe FACTS Benchmark is likely to become a standard reference point for procurement. When evaluating models for enterprise use, technical leaders should look beyond the composite score and drill into the specific sub-benchmark that matches their use case:Building a Customer Support Bot? Look at the Grounding score to ensure the bot sticks to your policy documents. (Gemini 2.5 Pro actually outscored Gemini 3 Pro here, 74.2 vs 69.0).Building a Research Assistant? Prioritize Search scores.Building an Image Analysis Tool? Proceed with extreme caution.As the FACTS team noted in their release, \"All evaluated models achieved an overall accuracy below 70%, leaving considerable headroom for future progress.\"For now, the message to the industry is clear: The models are getting smarter, but they aren&#x27;t yet infallible. Design your systems with the assumption that, roughly one-third of the time, the raw model might just be wrong.",

The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it). Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

          "title": "12 steps you can take right now to be safer online",
          "standfirst": "There's a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: \"How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?\" In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner. But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity. Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. A related tip is to never copy and paste something into your URL bar if you aren't absolutely sure of what it will do. Social engineering doesn't always get you to click the link — sometimes attackers leave it un-hyperlinked so mousing over it doesn't reveal anything. This also goes for the command modules on desktop and laptop computers. In a recent documented attack, hackers convinced AI chatbots to suggest a command that gave them root access to the victim's device. Never copy-paste anything into the command window without verifying it first, especially if an AI told you to do it. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device. 10. Use email maskers and private search engines If you're concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you're in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding. For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address. Sam Chapman for Engadget Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track anything you do — it's funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers. 11. Use a data removal service Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you've been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers. Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety. The longer one has your personal information, the more likely it is to leak. The good news is that most brokers (though not all of them) are legally required to delete your data if you ask them to. However, there are a lot of data brokers out there, and they really want to keep your data. Each one makes opting out harder than uninstalling a Norton product — and hundreds of them may have files on you. To make the process easier, you can use a data removal service like DeleteMe or Surfshark VPN's partner service Incogni. 12. Practice physical security Let's close out the list by getting a little old school. I've already discussed how many online scams depend on classic con artistry to work. By the same token, physical infiltration and smash-and-grab tactics still pose a threat to cybersecurity. It doesn't take too much imagination to see how this could work. If you leave your laptop or phone unattended in public, for example, someone might insert a flash drive that loads malware onto the system. In one illustrative case, a thief in the Minneapolis area would loiter in bars, watch people unlock their phones, then steal those phones and unlock them himself. I'm not saying you need to be paranoid every second you're in public. Just use the same level of caution you'd use to protect your car. Lock your phone with a biometric key so only you can open it, and make sure not to leave any device lying around if it can access your online accounts. And at work, be careful not to let anyone into a secure area if they don't have the proper credentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss",
          "content": "There's a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: \"How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?\" In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner. But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity. Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. A related tip is to never copy and paste something into your URL bar if you aren't absolutely sure of what it will do. Social engineering doesn't always get you to click the link — sometimes attackers leave it un-hyperlinked so mousing over it doesn't reveal anything. This also goes for the command modules on desktop and laptop computers. In a recent documented attack, hackers convinced AI chatbots to suggest a command that gave them root access to the victim's device. Never copy-paste anything into the command window without verifying it first, especially if an AI told you to do it. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device. 10. Use email maskers and private search engines If you're concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you're in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding. For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address. Sam Chapman for Engadget Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track anything you do — it's funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers. 11. Use a data removal service Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you've been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers. Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety.

Electric vehicles were hot stuff, buoyed by Tesla’s increasingly stratospheric valuation and a general optimism fueled by what would turn out to be the most significant climate-focused spending package in US history. For some time, automakers had been promising an all-electric future, and they started laying the groundwork to make that happen, partnering with battery suppliers and the like. Take Ford—that year, it announced a joint venture with SK to build a pair of battery factories, one in Kentucky, the other in Tennessee. BlueOvalSK represented an $11.4 billion investment that would create 11,000 jobs, we were told, and an annual output of 60 GWh from both plants. Four years later, things look very different. EV subsidies are dead, as is any inclination by the current government to hold automakers accountable for selling too many gas guzzlers. EV-heavy product plans have been thrown out, and designs for new combustion-powered cars are being dusted off and spiffed up. Fewer EVs means a lower need for batteries, and today we saw that in evidence when it emerged that Ford and SK On are ending their battery factory joint venture.Read full article Comments",

He tells Ars that the project he started in The Witness’ wake was meant to serve as a quick proof of concept for a new engine and programming language he was working on. “It was supposed to be a short game,” that could be finished in “like a year and a half or two years,” he said. Now, after nine years of development—and his fair share of outspoken, controversial statements—Blow is finally approaching the finish line on that “short game.” He said Order of the Sinking Star—which was announced Thursday via a Game Awards trailer ahead of a planned 2026 release—now encompasses around 1,400 individual puzzles that could take completionists 400 to 500 hours to fully conquer.

Shortly after that launch, though, players quickly discovered a way to make their houses float high above the ground by exploiting an unintended, invisible UI glitch. Now, Blizzard says that the overwhelming response to that accidental house hovering has been so strong that it’s pivoting to integrate it as an official part of the game. “We were going to fix flying houses to bring them back to terra firma, but you all made such awesome stuff, so we made it possible with the base UI instead.” WoW principal designer Jesse Kurlancheek posted on social media Tuesday. Lead producer Kyle Hartline followed up on that announcement with some behind-the-scenes gossip: “Like no joke we had an ops channel about how to roll out the float fix but folks shared like 5 of the dopest houses and we all kinda immediately agreed this was way too cool to change,” he wrote.Read full article Comments",

The legal notice says Google has copied a “large corpus” of Disney’s works to train its gen AI models, which is believable, as Google’s image and video models will happily produce popular Disney characters—they couldn’t do that without feeding the models lots of Disney data. The C&D also takes issue with Google for distributing “copies of its protected works” to consumers. So all those memes you’ve been making with Disney characters? Yeah, Disney doesn’t like that, either.

Plans for a Supergirl movie date all the way back to 2018, but the merger that produced Warner Bros. Discovery scuttled the original concept. James Gunn and Peter Safran came in as co-CEOs of the new DC Studios and announced plans for a “soft reboot” of the DC universe, starting with this summer’s Superman. Sasha Calle played Supergirl for a brief appearance in 2023’s The Flash, but despite having signed a multi-year contract, Gunn and Safran decided to go in a different direction for their standalone film and cast Alcock (House of the Dragon) instead. Gunn particularly wanted to distance this new version of Supergirl from earlier incarnations, especially how the character was portrayed by Melissa Benoist in the Arrowverse series that ran from 2015–2021. He wanted someone less earnest, more of a contrast to David Corenswet’s wholesome Superman. “This is a story-based medium; we want stories to be in theaters that are cool and different from each other,” Gunn said at a media briefing. “And this movie is not exactly just a female clone of Superman. It’s its own thing entirely. And with a character who’s equally worthy of this treatment.”Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist hellbent on warping the agency to fit his anti-science agenda. Then, on August 27, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez just weeks after she was confirmed by the Senate. She had refused to blindly approve vaccine recommendations from a panel of vaccine skeptics and contrarians that he had hand-selected. The agency descended into chaos, and Monarez wasn’t the only one to leave the agency that day.

But it was difficult to get a feel for what using that drivetrain was like when it was being used to shift a large and extremely heavy cargo bike. So, I jumped at the opportunity when Urban Arrow’s sister company, Gazelle, offered a chance to ride one of its new Arroyo models, which feature the same drivetrain, but this time coupled to a fairly standard commuter bike. Getting rid of all the weight and bulk really allowed the drive system to shine. And, as with its cargo-carrying cousin, the bike is filled with thoughtful touches and design decisions that make riding it a pleasure. But all that comes at a cost: This is a premium bike with little in the way of compromises, and it’s priced accordingly. High-end hardware The Arroyo line is meant for commuters and urban/suburban riding. It has a step-through frame, a large rack, fenders, and its riding stance is very upright. In keeping with its Dutch heritage, it’s meant to be ridden as a bicycle, rather than a bike-like scooter. There’s no throttle to let you avoid pedaling, and even when it’s set to its maximum assist rating, you’ll end up putting in a reasonable amount of effort during the ride. If you’re looking for something that lets you handle a commute in hot weather without sweating, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere.Read full article Comments",

The model achieves a 72.2 percent score on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark that attempts to test whether AI systems can solve real GitHub issues, putting it among the top-performing open-weights models. Perhaps more notably, Mistral didn’t just release an AI model, it released a new development app called Mistral Vibe. It’s a command line interface (CLI) similar to Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI that lets developers interact with the Devstral models directly in their terminal. The tool can scan file structures and Git status to maintain context across an entire project, make changes across multiple files, and execute shell commands autonomously. Mistral released the CLI under the Apache 2.0 license. It’s always wise to take AI benchmarks with a large grain of salt, but we’ve heard from employees of the big AI companies that they pay very close attention to how well models do on SWE-bench Verified, which presents AI models with 500 real software engineering problems pulled from GitHub issues in popular Python repositories. The AI must read the issue description, navigate the codebase, and generate a working patch that passes unit tests. While some AI researchers have noted that around 90 percent of the tasks in the benchmark test relatively simple bug fixes that experienced engineers could complete in under an hour, it’s one of the few standardized ways to compare coding models.Read full article Comments",

          "title": "No sterile neutrinos after all, say MicroBooNE physicists",
          "standfirst": "There's a less than 5 percent chance that earlier anomalies can be explained by fourth neutrino \"flavor.\"",
          "content": "Since the 1990s, physicists have pondered the tantalizing possibility of an exotic fourth type of neutrino, dubbed the “sterile” neutrino, that doesn’t interact with regular matter at all, apart from its fellow neutrinos, perhaps. But definitive experimental evidence for sterile neutrinos has remained elusive. Now it looks like the latest results from Fermilab’s MiniBooNE experiment have ruled out the sterile neutrino entirely, according to a paper published in the journal Nature. How did the possibility of sterile neutrinos even become a thing? It all dates back to the so-called “solar neutrino problem.” Physicists detected the first solar neutrinos from the Sun in 1966. The only problem was that there were far fewer solar neutrinos being detected than predicted by theory, a conundrum that became known as the solar neutrino problem. In 1962, physicists discovered a second type (“flavor”) of neutrino, the muon neutrino. This was followed by the discovery of a third flavor, the tau neutrino, in 2000. Physicists already suspected that neutrinos might be able to switch from one flavor to another. In 2002, scientists at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (or SNO) announced that they had solved the solar neutrino problem. The missing solar (electron) neutrinos were just in disguise, having changed into a different flavor on the long journey between the Sun and the Earth. If neutrinos oscillate, then they must have a teensy bit of mass after all. That posed another knotty neutrino-related problem. There are three neutrino flavors, but none of them has a well-defined mass. Rather, different kinds of “mass states” mix together in various ways to produce electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. That’s quantum weirdness for you.Read full article Comments",

This represents a major change in thinking from the world’s leading space company and its founder, Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal and The Information first reported about a possible IPO last Friday, and Bloomberg followed that up on Tuesday evening with a report suggesting the company would target a $1.5 trillion valuation. This would allow SpaceX to raise in excess of $30 billion. This is an enormous amount of funding. The largest IPO in history occurred in 2019, when the state-owned Saudi Arabian oil company began public trading as Aramco and raised $29 billion. In terms of revenue, Aramco is a top-five company in the world.Read full article Comments",

But the H200 is six times more powerful than the H20, the most advanced chip available in China today. Meanwhile China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, is estimated to be about two years behind Nvidia’s technology. By approving the sales, Trump may unwittingly be helping Chinese chip makers “catch up” to Nvidia, Jake Sullivan told The New York Times.
