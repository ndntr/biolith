This is something of a winter tradition for the Amazon-owned platform and the promotion ends on January 21. An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything. However, it's easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright. In other words, it's a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren't enjoying the platform.

          "standfirst": "You can easily spruce up your nightstand or desk by decluttering a bit, replacing some of those annoying charging cables with a good wireless charging setup. One of our favorites that can handle three devices at once is the UGREEN MagFlow Qi2 3-in-1 Charger Station 25W. Normally $140, it's on sale right now for $95; that's 32 percent off and only about $5 more than its record-low price. This is our top pick for a 3-in-1 charging pad thanks to its versatility. The UGREEN can work equally well as a permanent fixture in your home or act as a portable charging station. It boasts a foldable design and has smart little design details to keep it feeling like a premium product. The Qi2 25W charging works across a range of iPhone models and accessories, such as AirPods. There's also a dedicated part of the pad's design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you'll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable. We felt this UGREEN model was a great value at $140, so being able to snag one for a third of the usual price is an even better deal.

To save yourself some money in the process, you can pick up a year-long subscription to Monarch Money, one of Engadget's favorite budgeting apps, for just $50 if you use code NEWYEAR2026 at checkout and you're a new subscriber. That's a 50 percent discount on the service's normal $100 price. Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you're tracking that month. How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you've labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together. The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app's learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch's web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you're trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.

The retailer is selling the one meter Apple Magsafe charger for $30, saving you $10 off the regular price, while also selling the two meter model for $40 ($10 off). If you have an iPhone 16, iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, this cable can charge your device at 25W as long as it's connected to a 30W power adapter on the other end. While you'll need a more recent iPhone to get the fastest MagSafe charging speeds, the charger can wirelessly top up the battery of any iPhone from the last eight years (iPhone 8 and later). With older iPhones, the charging speed tops out at 15W. The cable works with AirPods wireless charging cases too — it's certified for Qi2.2 and Qi charging. The MagSafe charger is one of our favorite iPhone accessories, and would pair quite nicely with your new iPhone if you're picking up one of the latest models.

          "standfirst": "The peak time for deals on streaming services — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported Disney+ Hulu bundle for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month). We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.

          "title": "Why reinforcement learning plateaus without representation depth (and other key takeaways from NeurIPS 2025)",
          "standfirst": "Every year, NeurIPS produces hundreds of impressive papers, and a handful that subtly reset how practitioners think about scaling, evaluation and system design. In 2025, the most consequential works weren&#x27;t about a single breakthrough model. Instead, they challenged fundamental assumptions that academicians and corporations have quietly relied on: Bigger models mean better reasoning, RL creates new capabilities, attention is “solved” and generative models inevitably memorize.This year’s top papers collectively point to a deeper shift: AI progress is now constrained less by raw model capacity and more by architecture, training dynamics and evaluation strategy.Below is a technical deep dive into five of the most influential NeurIPS 2025 papers — and what they mean for anyone building real-world AI systems.1. LLMs are converging—and we finally have a way to measure itPaper: Artificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of Language ModelsFor years, LLM evaluation has focused on correctness. But in open-ended or ambiguous tasks like brainstorming, ideation or creative synthesis, there often is no single correct answer. The risk instead is homogeneity: Models producing the same “safe,” high-probability responses.This paper introduces Infinity-Chat, a benchmark designed explicitly to measure diversity and pluralism in open-ended generation. Rather than scoring answers as right or wrong, it measures:Intra-model collapse: How often the same model repeats itselfInter-model homogeneity: How similar different models’ outputs areThe result is uncomfortable but important: Across architectures and providers, models increasingly converge on similar outputs — even when multiple valid answers exist.Why this matters in practiceFor corporations, this reframes “alignment” as a trade-off. Preference tuning and safety constraints can quietly reduce diversity, leading to assistants that feel too safe, predictable or biased toward dominant viewpoints.Takeaway: If your product relies on creative or exploratory outputs, diversity metrics need to be first-class citizens. 2. Attention isn’t finished — a simple gate changes everythingPaper: Gated Attention for Large Language ModelsTransformer attention has been treated as settled engineering. This paper proves it isn’t.The authors introduce a small architectural change: Apply a query-dependent sigmoid gate after scaled dot-product attention, per attention head. That’s it. No exotic kernels, no massive overhead.Across dozens of large-scale training runs — including dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models trained on trillions of tokens — this gated variant:Improved stabilityReduced “attention sinks”Enhanced long-context performanceConsistently outperformed vanilla attentionWhy it worksThe gate introduces:Non-linearity in attention outputsImplicit sparsity, suppressing pathological activationsThis challenges the assumption that attention failures are purely data or optimization problems.Takeaway: Some of the biggest LLM reliability issues may be architectural — not algorithmic — and solvable with surprisingly small changes.3. RL can scale — if you scale in depth, not just dataPaper: 1,000-Layer Networks for Self-Supervised Reinforcement LearningConventional wisdom says RL doesn’t scale well without dense rewards or demonstrations. This paper reveals that that assumption is incomplete.By scaling network depth aggressively from typical 2 to 5 layers to nearly 1,000 layers, the authors demonstrate dramatic gains in self-supervised, goal-conditioned RL, with performance improvements ranging from 2X to 50X.The key isn’t brute force. It’s pairing depth with contrastive objectives, stable optimization regimes and goal-conditioned representationsWhy this matters beyond roboticsFor agentic systems and autonomous workflows, this suggests that representation depth — not just data or reward shaping — may be a critical lever for generalization and exploration.Takeaway: RL’s scaling limits may be architectural, not fundamental.4. Why diffusion models generalize instead of memorizingPaper: Why Diffusion Models Don&#x27;t Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in TrainingDiffusion models are massively overparameterized, yet they often generalize remarkably well. This paper explains why.The authors identify two distinct training timescales:One where generative quality rapidly improvesAnother — much slower — where memorization emergesCrucially, the memorization timescale grows linearly with dataset size, creating a widening window where models improve without overfitting.Practical implicationsThis reframes early stopping and dataset scaling strategies. Memorization isn’t inevitable — it’s predictable and delayed.Takeaway: For diffusion training, dataset size doesn’t just improve quality — it actively delays overfitting.5. RL improves reasoning performance, not reasoning capacity Paper: Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning in LLMs?Perhaps the most strategically important result of NeurIPS 2025 is also the most sobering.This paper rigorously tests whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) actually creates new reasoning abilities in LLMs — or simply reshapes existing ones.Their conclusion: RLVR primarily improves sampling efficiency, not reasoning capacity. At large sample sizes, the base model often already contains the correct reasoning trajectories.What this means for LLM training pipelinesRL is better understood as:A distribution-shaping mechanismNot a generator of fundamentally new capabilitiesTakeaway: To truly expand reasoning capacity, RL likely needs to be paired with mechanisms like teacher distillation or architectural changes — not used in isolation.The bigger picture: AI progress is becoming systems-limited Taken together, these papers point to a common theme:The bottleneck in modern AI is no longer raw model size — it’s system design.Diversity collapse requires new evaluation metricsAttention failures require architectural fixesRL scaling depends on depth and representationMemorization depends on training dynamics, not parameter countReasoning gains depend on how distributions are shaped, not just optimizedFor builders, the message is clear: Competitive advantage is shifting from “who has the biggest model” to “who understands the system.”Maitreyi Chatterjee is a software engineer.Devansh Agarwal currently works as an ML engineer at FAANG.",

At large sample sizes, the base model often already contains the correct reasoning trajectories.What this means for LLM training pipelinesRL is better understood as:A distribution-shaping mechanismNot a generator of fundamentally new capabilitiesTakeaway: To truly expand reasoning capacity, RL likely needs to be paired with mechanisms like teacher distillation or architectural changes — not used in isolation.The bigger picture: AI progress is becoming systems-limited Taken together, these papers point to a common theme:The bottleneck in modern AI is no longer raw model size — it’s system design.Diversity collapse requires new evaluation metricsAttention failures require architectural fixesRL scaling depends on depth and representationMemorization depends on training dynamics, not parameter countReasoning gains depend on how distributions are shaped, not just optimizedFor builders, the message is clear: Competitive advantage is shifting from “who has the biggest model” to “who understands the system.”Maitreyi Chatterjee is a software engineer.Devansh Agarwal currently works as an ML engineer at FAANG.",

          "standfirst": "E Ink tablet maker reMarkable is running a bundle deal right now that can save you between $80 and $90 when buying a reMarkable 2 along with a Marker stylus and a folio case. The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio. The offer runs through January 17. The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up. The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for best e-ink tablet. In our review, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable. The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn't think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless. The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges. The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet. The pricier tablet also has bundle deals right now with savings up to $80 depending on configuration.

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from $160, while League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. We're almost halfway through the season at this point, so it makes sense for a service like League Pass to start offering some discounts. The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once. Last year, League Pass added multiview, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game. Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games. If you're an avid NBA fan that follows multiple teams then the League Pass almost certainly carries dozens of games you can watch even with the restrictions in the US.

          "standfirst": "AirPods work most smoothly with Apple hardware, but they also connect reliably to Android phones, Windows laptops and other Bluetooth devices. The pairing process depends on the platform in use although the basics remain the same. Once the AirPods are placed in pairing mode, most devices detect them quickly and handle the remaining steps in the background. The guide below explains how to pair AirPods with Apple products, how the process differs on newer iPhones that support H2 features and how to connect them to non-Apple devices.How to pair AirPods with Apple devicesApple builds AirPods to pair almost instantly with devices in its own ecosystem. Opening the charging case near an unlocked iPhone or iPad usually brings up an on-screen prompt. Tapping Connect links the earbuds to the device and to every other Apple product signed into the same iCloud account. After that, switching between devices is automatic. Audio output follows the active device as long as each product is using updated software and is signed in with the same Apple ID.If the pairing prompt does not appear, there are a few simple checks that help things move along. Opening the Control Center and selecting the audio output menu confirms whether the AirPods already appear as an available device. If they are listed there, choosing them establishes the connection. If they do not appear, opening the Settings app and checking Bluetooth usually reveals whether the AirPods are in range or already recognized. Opening the case while viewing the Bluetooth menu often triggers the pairing card once more.The process is similar across Apple Watch and Mac. When the AirPods are already linked to an iPhone, they tend to show up automatically on a paired Apple Watch. On Mac, opening System Settings and viewing the Bluetooth section reveals the same device list seen on an iPhone. Selecting the AirPods from that list completes the connection and also syncs the pairing status back to every other Apple device using the same account.Enhanced pairing with newer iPhonesSome newer iPhones support features enabled by the H2 chip used in newer AirPods models. With compatible AirPods, models such as iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 lineup tend to deliver a faster and more responsive setup experience. When an AirPods case is opened near one of these phones, the device quickly detects the earbuds and displays the pairing card with little delay. This also tends to speed up transitions between devices and improves reliability when switching audio sources.If the fast pairing prompt does not appear on a newer iPhone, reopening the case while the phone is unlocked is usually enough to reinitiate the process. It also helps to confirm that Bluetooth is turned on. Placing the AirPods back in the case for a few seconds and trying again will often reset the pairing state if the earbuds were connected elsewhere.AirPods Pro 3EngadgetHow to put AirPods into pairing modeEvery AirPods model supports a manual pairing mode. This is essential when linking the earbuds to devices outside the Apple ecosystem, or when the automatic prompt fails to appear on an iPhone or Mac. On older AirPods models, pairing mode is activated by opening the lid and pressing and holding the setup button on the back of the case until the LED light flashes white. Newer models, including AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, use a touch-based method instead. With the lid open, tapping the area near the LED light places the earbuds into pairing mode. Leaving the lid open keeps the AirPods discoverable for nearby devices. Closing the case ends the process and requires it to be repeated if the device fails to detect them.Pairing mode does not remove any previous connections. It simply makes the AirPods available to new devices, which is helpful when switching between ecosystems. However, connecting to a new device usually takes priority. If the AirPods are already linked to something else that is nearby, turning off Bluetooth on the previously connected device prevents interference and helps the new device detect them more easily.How to pair AirPods with Android devicesAlthough AirPods are designed for Apple hardware, they function like any other Bluetooth earbuds on Android. Opening the case and placing the AirPods in pairing mode allows Android phones to detect them through the standard Bluetooth menu. The earbuds appear in the list of available devices and selecting them initiates the connection. Once paired, AirPods work for calls and media playback. Some features, such as automatic ear detection and battery status indicators, may require a third-party app on Android and are not supported at a system level. Features such as spatial audio and device switching remain exclusive to Apple’s ecosystem but day-to-day performance is consistent on Android.If the AirPods fail to appear, refreshing the Bluetooth device list on the Android phone usually helps. Making sure the earbuds are still in pairing mode is essential since the white LED indicator stops flashing after a short period. Reopening the case and holding the button again, or tapping on the front for newer models, restores discoverability.How to pair AirPods with Windows laptopsWindows 11 handles AirPods as a regular audio device. Opening the Bluetooth and Devices menu in System Settings displays a list of nearby accessories. With the AirPods in pairing mode, the laptop should detect them and display them as an audio device. Selecting them completes the process and adds the earbuds to the device’s known accessories. Windows generally reconnects to AirPods automatically on future sessions as long as Bluetooth remains enabled.If the earbuds do not appear in the list, toggling Bluetooth off and back on helps the system refresh the device scan. Checking whether the AirPods are already linked to a different device is another useful step. Windows sometimes struggles to take over a connection when the earbuds remain in range of a previously paired phone so disabling Bluetooth on the other device often resolves the issue.Troubleshooting common pairing issuesMost pairing problems come down to the AirPods not being in discoverable mode or being connected to another device nearby. Resetting the earbuds solves many problems. On AirPods models with a setup button, placing the AirPods in the case, leaving the lid open and holding the button until the LED turns amber then white restores the factory pairing state. On newer models without a physical button, place the AirPods in the case, close the lid for about 30 seconds, then open it and quickly tap the front of the case three times. The status light should then flash amber and then white, to indicate that the reset is complete. This clears previous connections and makes the AirPods behave as if they are new out of the box. Low battery levels can also interrupt pairing. Ensuring both the earbuds and the case have enough charge prevents unexpected disconnections during setup. Interference from other wireless accessories affects pairing on crowded networks. Moving to a quieter spot or turning off surrounding Bluetooth devices helps the AirPods stand out when scanning.AirPods are built to pair quickly with Apple devices but they also integrate smoothly with other platforms. Keeping the earbuds in pairing mode and confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on the device in use ensures a smooth setup every time. Once connected, the AirPods tend to remember the device and reconnect whenever they are nearby which keeps day-to-day use simple regardless of the platform.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-pair-airpods-with-any-device-140000234.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "I came out of my CyberGhost review with a positive opinion, feeling it had earned its spot in my best VPN roundup. However, even an expert review is subjective, and there's a chance CyberGhost will not work for you. If that’s the case, here's how to cancel your subscription.How to stop your CyberGhost subscription renewingCancelling your CyberGhost subscription won't end it right away, unless you delete your account or get the refund (I'll explain how to do both of those later). Instead, the way to cancel CyberGhost is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of each billing period. Once you've done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends.The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section.Open your browser and go to cyberghostvpn.com.At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled My Account. Enter your username and password if you aren't logged in already.Look at the top-right corner of the new screen and click the CyberGhost logo next to your email address. From the drop-down menu, select Subscriptions.Find the subscription you want to cancel and select Cancel Subscription.When prompted, click Continue to Cancel.Click the logo at top-right, then click Subscriptions to manage auto-renewal.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThis will turn off automatic billing for your account. The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term. If you're within the refund period — 14 days for a monthly subscription and 45 days for all others — you can now request your money back.How to cancel CyberGhost if you subscribed through an app storeWhen you subscribe to an app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the store handles the billing; the app provider doesn't process the money itself. If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you'll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here's how to do it.If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you'll need to cancel through your Apple ID. Here are the steps.Open the Settings app on your home screen.At the top of the Settings menu, you'll see your name. Tap it.In your Apple Account menu, tap Subscriptions.Scroll until you find your CyberGhost subscription, then tap on it.Tap the words Cancel Subscription, then follow the prompts.Here's what to do if you subscribed through the Google Play store. Similar to the Apple process, you'll go through the list of subscriptions on your profile.Open the Google Play Store app.Tap the circle in the top-right corner with the first letter of your name.Find the Payments & Subscriptions menu and tap on it.

          "content": "I came out of my CyberGhost review with a positive opinion, feeling it had earned its spot in my best VPN roundup. However, even an expert review is subjective, and there's a chance CyberGhost will not work for you. If that’s the case, here's how to cancel your subscription.How to stop your CyberGhost subscription renewingCancelling your CyberGhost subscription won't end it right away, unless you delete your account or get the refund (I'll explain how to do both of those later). Instead, the way to cancel CyberGhost is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of each billing period. Once you've done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends.The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section.Open your browser and go to cyberghostvpn.com.At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled My Account. Enter your username and password if you aren't logged in already.Look at the top-right corner of the new screen and click the CyberGhost logo next to your email address. From the drop-down menu, select Subscriptions.Find the subscription you want to cancel and select Cancel Subscription.When prompted, click Continue to Cancel.Click the logo at top-right, then click Subscriptions to manage auto-renewal.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThis will turn off automatic billing for your account. The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term. If you're within the refund period — 14 days for a monthly subscription and 45 days for all others — you can now request your money back.How to cancel CyberGhost if you subscribed through an app storeWhen you subscribe to an app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the store handles the billing; the app provider doesn't process the money itself. If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you'll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here's how to do it.If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you'll need to cancel through your Apple ID. Here are the steps.Open the Settings app on your home screen.At the top of the Settings menu, you'll see your name. Tap it.In your Apple Account menu, tap Subscriptions.Scroll until you find your CyberGhost subscription, then tap on it.Tap the words Cancel Subscription, then follow the prompts.Here's what to do if you subscribed through the Google Play store. Similar to the Apple process, you'll go through the list of subscriptions on your profile.Open the Google Play Store app.Tap the circle in the top-right corner with the first letter of your name.Find the Payments & Subscriptions menu and tap on it. On the next menu that appears, tap Subscriptions.Scroll down until you find your CyberGhost subscription.

Several neat-looking games arrived this week, we got release dates for several others that I'm really looking forward to and a brand-new Steam festival was announced. The Love, Romance, and Heartbreak Debutante Ball is said to be the first Valentine's Day-themed Steam festival. It'll run from February 13 to 20 and feature more than 100 games, including discounts and demos. A showcase will take place on February 13 at 1PM ET on the Sunny Demeanor Games YouTube channel too.Organizers say the festival includes a wide variety of games about love, including RPGs, puzzle games and (naturally) visual novels. You might play as a cat or someone trying to fish an engagement ring out of a claw machine, as a secret agent or a couple that's run off to another planet. I'm intrigued! There will be some NSFW games involved, for what it's worth.New releasesQuarantine Zone: The Last Check seems like a 3D version of Papers Please but with zombies. At a checkpoint amid a zombie outbreak, your mission is to screen survivors for signs of infection. If you're unsure of their status, you can send an individual to quarantine for further observation or a lab for additional screening. Otherwise, you can let them in or send them to \"liquidation.\" Get things wrong and it could spell disaster, but at least you have a sidearm (and a weaponized drone) to help you deal with sticky situations.It looks like there's a lot going on in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, which is from Brigada Games and publisher Devolver Digital. There are base and resource management aspects as well. It's out now on Steam (usually $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until January 26) and PC Game Pass.Air Hares seems to draw inspiration from classic top-down shoot-'em-ups. But instead of simply blowing up countless ships, your mission is to restore farmland. You'll fire seeds and water to turn barren land into fertile carrot fields. There are still enemies to contend with — you (and perhaps a co-op partner) can dodge and ram them as you try to protect the land. Expect boss battles, too.I really like the aesthetic here. It has a '90s-style cartoon look (I suddenly really want a modern Bucky O'Hare game). Also, the song from the trailer is going to live in my head for weeks.Husband-and-wife team Tim and Megan Bungeroth created Air Hares over six years with the help of several contributors. According to a press release, the game is \"inspired by the creators’ personal journey with infertility and the idea of creating life rather than destroying it.\" Air Hares is out now on Steam. It typically costs $9, but there's a 20 percent discount until January 28.Luckshot Games' Big Hops looks like my kind of 3D platformer: joyous and playful. As a young frog who has been kidnapped, you'll try to find airship parts for a raccoon who has promised to help get you home.There are tons of movement mechanics here, and Hop's tongue plays a major role in those. You can use it to swing across gaps, hookshot your way to higher platforms and solve puzzles. Big Hops is out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch and PS5 for $20. The Switch and Steam versions have a 10 percent launch discount until January 19.Cassette Boy is a pixel-art game that might appear to be a 2D exploration puzzler, but there's more going on here. You can rotate the world to discover new secrets and hide enemies and hazards from view so you can move past them. If you can't see something on your screen, it doesn't exist. There's a bit of a Fez influence here, it would appear.Wonderland Kazakiri and publisher Pocketpair are behind this one, which I'm looking forward to checking out when I have a chance. Cassette Boy is available on Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S for $13.Upcoming I really enjoyed the demo for Aerial_Knight’s DropShot (as well as Aerial_Knight’s previous games). I'm for sure going to be playing the full game when it hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store on February 17.This is a single-player first-person shooter in which you're skydiving with finger guns. You compete with four enemies to grab the only available parachute as you're falling through the air. Rounds are fast-paced too, generally lasting under a minute.Point-and-click adventure Earth Must Die has been on my radar for a while and we'll all get a chance to try it soon. It's designed to be a playable cartoon (with a runtime of about eight hours) and it has an art style to match. The cast is pretty stellar, with Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II), Joel Fry (Our Flag Means Death) and a whole load of British comedy figures on board. There's a demo available on Steam now and the full game — from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots — will land on January 27.Let's wrap things up for this week something very silly-looking from Monster Shop Games. Pie in the Sky is a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-inspired action arcade game in which you play as a magpie that terrorizes bystanders. You can knock people off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, ram kids off of scooters, actually go skateboarding and, uh, cause havoc from above. In classic THPS-style, there are hidden areas too. This looks like a fun distraction from [gestures at everything].

          "standfirst": "The German AI startup Black Forest Labs (BFL), founded by former Stability AI engineers, is continuing to build out its suite of open source AI image generators with the release of FLUX.2 [klein], a new pair of small models — one open and one non-commercial — that emphasizes speed and lower compute requirements, with the models generating images in less than a second on a Nvidia GB200. The [klein] series, released yesterday, includes two primary parameter counts: 4 billion (4B) and 9 billion (9B).The model weights are available on Hugging Face and code on Github.While the larger models in the FLUX.2 family ([max] and [pro]), released in November of 2025, chase the limits of photorealism and \"grounding search\" capabilities, [klein] is designed specifically for consumer hardware and latency-critical workflows.In great news for enterprises, the 4B version is available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning they — or any organization or developer — can use the [klein] models for their commercial purposes without paying BFL or any intermediaries a dime. However, a number of AI image and media creation platforms including Fal.ai have begun offering it for extremely low cost as well through their application programming interfaces (APIs) and as a direct-to-user tool. Already, it&#x27;s won strong praise from early users for its speed. What it lacks for in overall image quality, it seems to make up for in its fast generation capability, open license, affordability and small footprint — benefitting enterprises who want to run image models on their own hardware or at extremely low cost. So how did BFL do it and how can it benefit you? Read on to learn more.The \"Pareto Frontier\" of LatencyThe technical philosophy behind [klein] is what BFL documentation describes as defining the \"Pareto frontier\" for quality versus latency. In simple terms, they have attempted to squeeze the maximum possible visual fidelity into a model small enough to run on a home gaming PC without a noticeable lag.The performance metrics released by the company paint a picture of a model built for interactivity rather than just batch generation. According to Black Forest Labs&#x27; official figures, the [klein] models are capable of generating or editing images in under 0.5 seconds on modern hardware. Even on standard consumer GPUs like an RTX 3090 or 4070, the 4B model is designed to fit comfortably within approximately 13GB of VRAM.This speed is achieved through \"distillation,\" a process where a larger, more complex model \"teaches\" a smaller, more efficient one to approximate its outputs in fewer steps. The distilled [klein] variants require only four steps to generate an image. This effectively turns the generation process from a coffee-break task into a near-instantaneous one, enabling what BFL describes on X (formerly Twitter) as \"developing ideas from 0 → 1\" in real-time.Under the Hood: Unified ArchitectureHistorically, image generation and image editing have often required different pipelines or complex adapters (like ControlNets). FLUX.2 [klein] attempts to unify these. The architecture natively supports text-to-image, single-reference editing, and multi-reference composition without needing to swap models.According to the documentation released on GitHub, the models support:Multi-Reference Editing: Users can upload up to four reference images (or ten in the playground) to guide the style or structure of the output.Hex-Code Color Control: A frequent pain point for designers is getting \"that exact shade of red.\" The new models accept specific hex codes in prompts (e.g., #800020) to force precise color rendering.Structured Prompting: The model parses JSON-like structured inputs for rigorously defined compositions, a feature clearly aimed at programmatic generation and enterprise pipelines.The Licensing Split: Open Weights vs. Open SourceFor startups and developers building on top of BFL’s tech, understanding the licensing landscape of this release is critical. BFL has adopted a split strategy that separates \"hobbyist/research\" use from \"commercial infrastructure.\"FLUX.2 [klein] 4B: Released under Apache 2.0. This is a permissive free software license that allows for commercial use, modification, and redistribution. If you are building a paid app, a SaaS platform, or a game that integrates AI generation, you can use the 4B model royalty-free.FLUX.2 [klein] 9B & [dev]: Released under the FLUX Non-Commercial License. These weights are open for researchers and hobbyists to download and experiment with, but they cannot be used for commercial applications without a separate agreement.This distinction positions the 4B model as a direct competitor to other open-weights models like Stable Diffusion 3 Medium or SDXL, but with a more modern architecture and a permissive license that removes legal ambiguity for startups.Ecosystem Integration: ComfyUI and BeyondBFL is clearly aware that a model is only as good as the tools that run it. Coinciding with the model drop, the team released official workflow templates for ComfyUI, the node-based interface that has become the standard integrated development environment (IDE) for AI artists.The workflows—specifically image_flux2_klein_text_to_image.json and the editing variants—allow users to drag and drop the new capabilities into existing pipelines immediately.Community reaction on social media has centered on this workflow integration and the speed. In a post on X, the official Black Forest Labs account highlighted the model&#x27;s ability to \"rapidly explore a specific aesthetic,\" showcasing a video where the style of an image shifted instantly as the user scrubbed through options.Why It Matters For Enterprise AI Decision-MakersThe release of FLUX.2 [klein] signals a maturation in the generative AI market, moving past the initial phase of novelty into a period defined by utility, integration, and speed.For Lead AI Engineers who are constantly juggling the need to balance speed with quality, this shift is pivotal. These professionals, who manage the full lifecycle of models from data preparation to deployment, often face the daily challenge of integrating rapidly evolving tools into existing workflows. The availability of a distilled 4B model under an Apache 2.0 license offers a practical solution for those focused on rapid deployment and fine-tuning to achieve specific business goals, allowing them to bypass the latency bottlenecks that typically plague high-fidelity image generation.For Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and automation, the implications are equally significant. These experts are responsible for building scalable AI pipelines and maintaining model integrity across different environments, often while working under strict budget constraints.The lightweight nature of the [klein] family directly addresses the challenge of implementing efficient systems with limited resources. By utilizing a model that fits within consumer-grade VRAM, orchestration specialists can architect cost-effective, local inference pipelines that avoid the heavy operational costs associated with massive proprietary models.Even for the Director of IT Security, the move toward capable, locally runnable open-weight models offers a distinct advantage. Tasked with protecting the organization from cyber threats and managing security operations with limited resources, reliance on external APIs for sensitive creative workflows can be a vulnerability. A high-quality model that runs locally allows security leaders to sanction AI tools that keep proprietary data within the corporate firewall, balancing the operational demands of the business with the robust security measures they are required to uphold.",

In a post on X, the official Black Forest Labs account highlighted the model&#x27;s ability to \"rapidly explore a specific aesthetic,\" showcasing a video where the style of an image shifted instantly as the user scrubbed through options.Why It Matters For Enterprise AI Decision-MakersThe release of FLUX.2 [klein] signals a maturation in the generative AI market, moving past the initial phase of novelty into a period defined by utility, integration, and speed.For Lead AI Engineers who are constantly juggling the need to balance speed with quality, this shift is pivotal. These professionals, who manage the full lifecycle of models from data preparation to deployment, often face the daily challenge of integrating rapidly evolving tools into existing workflows. The availability of a distilled 4B model under an Apache 2.0 license offers a practical solution for those focused on rapid deployment and fine-tuning to achieve specific business goals, allowing them to bypass the latency bottlenecks that typically plague high-fidelity image generation.For Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and automation, the implications are equally significant. These experts are responsible for building scalable AI pipelines and maintaining model integrity across different environments, often while working under strict budget constraints.The lightweight nature of the [klein] family directly addresses the challenge of implementing efficient systems with limited resources. By utilizing a model that fits within consumer-grade VRAM, orchestration specialists can architect cost-effective, local inference pipelines that avoid the heavy operational costs associated with massive proprietary models.Even for the Director of IT Security, the move toward capable, locally runnable open-weight models offers a distinct advantage. Tasked with protecting the organization from cyber threats and managing security operations with limited resources, reliance on external APIs for sensitive creative workflows can be a vulnerability. A high-quality model that runs locally allows security leaders to sanction AI tools that keep proprietary data within the corporate firewall, balancing the operational demands of the business with the robust security measures they are required to uphold.",

          "title": "How Google’s 'internal RL' could unlock long-horizon AI agents",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at Google have developed a technique that makes it easier for AI models to learn complex reasoning tasks that usually cause LLMs to hallucinate or fall apart. Instead of training LLMs through next-token prediction, their technique, called internal reinforcement learning (internal RL), steers the model’s internal activations toward developing a high-level step-by-step solution for the input problem. Ultimately, this could provide a scalable path for creating autonomous agents that can handle complex reasoning and real-world robotics without needing constant, manual guidance.The limits of next-token predictionReinforcement learning plays a key role in post-training LLMs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, the problem lies in the architecture of these models. LLMs are autoregressive, meaning they generate sequences one token at a time. When these models explore new strategies during training, they do so by making small, random changes to the next single token or action. This exposes a deeper limitation: next-token prediction forces models to search for solutions at the wrong level of abstraction, making long-horizon reasoning inefficient even when the model “knows” what to do.This token-by-token approach works well for basic language modeling but breaks down in long-horizon tasks where rewards are sparse. If the model relies solely on random token-level sampling, the probability of stumbling upon the correct multi-step solution is infinitesimally small, \"on the order of one in a million,\" according to the researchers.The issue isn&#x27;t just that the models get confused; it’s that they get confused at the wrong level. In comments provided to VentureBeat, Yanick Schimpf, a co-author of the paper, notes that in a 20-step task, an agent can get lost in the minute details of a single step, or it can lose track of the overall goal.\"We argue that when facing a problem with some abstract structure... [goal-oriented exploration] is what you want,\" Schimpf said. By solving the problem at the abstract level first, the agent commits to a path, ensuring it doesn&#x27;t \"get lost in one of the reasoning steps\" and fail to complete the broader workflow.To address this, the field has long looked toward hierarchical reinforcement learning. HRL attempts to solve complex problems by decomposing them into a hierarchy of temporally abstract actions (high-level subroutines that represent different stages of the solution) rather than managing a task as a string of tokens. However, discovering these appropriate subroutines remains a longstanding challenge. Current HRL methods often fail to discover proper policies, frequently \"converging to degenerate options\" that do not represent meaningful behaviors. Even sophisticated modern methods like GRPO (a popular RL algorithm used for sparse-reward tasks) fail in complex environments because they cannot effectively bridge the gap between low-level execution and high-level planning. Steering the LLM&#x27;s internal thoughtsTo overcome these limitations, the Google team proposed internal RL. Advanced autoregressive models already \"know\" how to perform complex, multi-step tasks internally, even if they aren&#x27;t explicitly trained to do so. Because these complex behaviors are hidden inside the model&#x27;s residual stream (i.e., the numerical values that carry information through the network&#x27;s layers), the researchers introduced an \"internal neural network controller,\" or metacontroller. Instead of monitoring and changing the output token, the metacontroller controls the model’s behavior by applying changes to the model&#x27;s internal activations in the middle layers.This nudge steers the model into a specific useful state. The base model then automatically generates the sequence of individual steps needed to achieve that goal because it has already seen those patterns during its initial pretraining. The metacontroller operates through unsupervised learning and does not require human-labeled training examples. Instead, the researchers use a self-supervised framework where the model analyzes a full sequence of behavior and works backward to infer the hidden, high-level intent that best explains the actions.During the internal RL phase, the updates are applied to the metacontroller, which shifts training from next-token prediction to learning high-level actions that can lead to the solution.To understand the practical value of this, consider an enterprise agent tasked with code generation. Today, there is a difficult trade-off: You need \"low temperature\" (predictability) to get the syntax right, but \"high temperature\" (creativity) to solve the logic puzzle.\"Internal RL might facilitate this by allowing the model to explore the space of abstract actions, i.e. structuring logic and method calls, while delegating the token-level realization of those actions to the robust, lower-temperature distribution of the base model,\" Schimpf said. The agent explores the solution without breaking the syntax.The researchers investigated two methods for applying this controller. In the first, the base autoregressive model is pretrained on a behavioral dataset and then frozen, while the metacontroller is trained to steer the frozen model&#x27;s residual stream. In the second, the metacontroller and the base model are jointly optimized, with parameters of both networks updated simultaneously. Internal RL in actionTo evaluate the effectiveness of internal RL, the researchers ran experiments across hierarchical environments designed to stump traditional learners. These included a discrete grid world and a continuous control task where a quadrupedal \"ant\" robot must coordinate joint movements. Both environments used sparse rewards with very long action sequences.While baselines like GRPO and CompILE failed to learn the tasks within a million episodes due to the difficulty of credit assignment over long horizons, internal RL achieved high success rates with a small number of training episodes. By choosing high-level goals rather than tiny steps, the metacontroller drastically reduced the search space. This allowed the model to identify which high-level decisions led to success, making credit assignment efficient enough to solve the sparse reward problem.Notably, the researchers found that the \"frozen\" approach was superior. When the base model and metacontroller were co-trained from scratch, the system failed to develop meaningful abstractions. However, applied to a frozen model, the metacontroller successfully discovered key checkpoints without any human labels, perfectly aligning its internal switching mechanism with the ground-truth moments when an agent finished one subgoal and started the next.As the industry currently fixates on reasoning models that output verbose \"chains of thought\" to solve problems, Google’s research points toward a different, perhaps more efficient future.\"Our study joins a growing body of work suggesting that &#x27;internal reasoning&#x27; is not only feasible but potentially more efficient than token-based approaches,\" Schimpf said. \"Moreover, these silent &#x27;thoughts&#x27; can be decoupled from specific input modalities — a property that could be particularly relevant for the future of multi-modal AI.\"If internal reasoning can be guided without being externalized, the future of AI agents may hinge less on prompting strategies and more on how well we can access and steer what models already represent internally. For enterprises betting on autonomous systems that must plan, adapt, and act over long horizons, that shift could matter more than any new reasoning benchmark.",

Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

          "title": "CyberGhost VPN review: Despite its flaws, the value is hard to beat",
          "standfirst": "CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it's much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. The CyberGhost VPN client for Windows 11. Sam Chapman for Engadget Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. CyberGhost's VPN client for macOS Sequoia. Sam Chapman for Engadget The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. This happened to me once or twice when my internet connection had no problems. Sam Chapman for Engadget Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. CyberGhost connected on an Android phone. Sam Chapman for Engadget That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The main page of CyberGhost's iPhone app. Sam Chapman for Engadget The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. A speed test using the fastest location chosen by the CyberGhost app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost never leaked my real IP address. Sam Chapman for Engadget CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. These prices are subject to change. Sam Chapman for Engadget One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. These may just be words, but they have legal force, at least in civil court. Sam Chapman for Engadget The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. CyberGhost unblocks Netflix Japan, revealing exclusive titles. Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. CyberGhost's selection of VPN servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. A few of CyberGhost's specialty servers on a MacBook. Sam Chapman for Engadget Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. There's no customization on CyberGhost's blocker -- just turn it on or off. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. You can program CyberGhost to take different actions on each of your usual networks. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. It didn't take me too long to get in touch with what was apparently a live expert. Sam Chapman for Engadget I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss",
          "content": "CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it's much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. The CyberGhost VPN client for Windows 11. Sam Chapman for Engadget Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. CyberGhost's VPN client for macOS Sequoia. Sam Chapman for Engadget The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. This happened to me once or twice when my internet connection had no problems. Sam Chapman for Engadget Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. CyberGhost connected on an Android phone. Sam Chapman for Engadget That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The main page of CyberGhost's iPhone app. Sam Chapman for Engadget The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. A speed test using the fastest location chosen by the CyberGhost app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost never leaked my real IP address. Sam Chapman for Engadget CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. These prices are subject to change. Sam Chapman for Engadget One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. These may just be words, but they have legal force, at least in civil court. Sam Chapman for Engadget The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. CyberGhost unblocks Netflix Japan, revealing exclusive titles. Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. CyberGhost's selection of VPN servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. A few of CyberGhost's specialty servers on a MacBook. Sam Chapman for Engadget Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. There's no customization on CyberGhost's blocker -- just turn it on or off. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. You can program CyberGhost to take different actions on each of your usual networks. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. It didn't take me too long to get in touch with what was apparently a live expert. Sam Chapman for Engadget I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss",

          "title": "OpenAI is bringing ads to ChatGPT",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT \"in the coming weeks.\" In a blog post published Friday, the company said adult users in the US of its free and Go tiers (more on the latter in a moment) would start seeing sponsored products and services appear below their conversations with its chatbot. \"Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer,\" OpenAI said, adding any sponsored spots would not influence the answers ChatGPT generates. \"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you.\" OpenAI says people won't see ads appear when they're talking to ChatGPT about sensitive subjects like their health, mental state of mind or current politics. The company also won't show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won't share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. \"We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,\" OpenAI adds. Users can dismiss ads, at which point they'll be asked to explain why they didn't engage with it. Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content. OpenAI\"Given what AI can do, we're excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,\" OpenAI said. However, the company was also quick to note its \"long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for.\"To that point, OpenAI said it would also make its ChatGPT Go subscription available to users in the US. The company first launched the tier in India last August, marketing it as a low-cost alternative to its more expensive Plus and Pro offerings. In the US, Go will cost $8 per month — or $12 less than the monthly price of the Plus plan — and offer 10 times higher rate limits for messages, file uploads and image creation than the free tier. The subscription also extends ChatGPT's memory and context window, meaning the chatbot will be better at remembering details from past conversations. That said, you'll see ads at this tier. To go ad-free, you'll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI's more expensive plans. For consumers, that means either the Plus or Pro plans. According to reports, OpenAI had been testing ads inside of ChatGPT since at least the end of last year. As companies continue to pay a high cost for model training and inference, all chatbots are likely to feature ads in some form. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html?src=rss",
          "content": "OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT \"in the coming weeks.\" In a blog post published Friday, the company said adult users in the US of its free and Go tiers (more on the latter in a moment) would start seeing sponsored products and services appear below their conversations with its chatbot. \"Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer,\" OpenAI said, adding any sponsored spots would not influence the answers ChatGPT generates. \"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you.\" OpenAI says people won't see ads appear when they're talking to ChatGPT about sensitive subjects like their health, mental state of mind or current politics. The company also won't show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won't share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. \"We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,\" OpenAI adds. Users can dismiss ads, at which point they'll be asked to explain why they didn't engage with it. Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content. OpenAI\"Given what AI can do, we're excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,\" OpenAI said. However, the company was also quick to note its \"long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for.\"To that point, OpenAI said it would also make its ChatGPT Go subscription available to users in the US. The company first launched the tier in India last August, marketing it as a low-cost alternative to its more expensive Plus and Pro offerings. In the US, Go will cost $8 per month — or $12 less than the monthly price of the Plus plan — and offer 10 times higher rate limits for messages, file uploads and image creation than the free tier. The subscription also extends ChatGPT's memory and context window, meaning the chatbot will be better at remembering details from past conversations. That said, you'll see ads at this tier.

Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance. “For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”Read full article Comments",

She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches. “They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There's just something really special about those coaches.” Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.Read full article Comments",

Riding atop one of NASA's diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world's heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours. The rollout marks a major step for NASA's Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.Read full article Comments",

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE. The Skaelget 2 shipwreck, with a diver for scale. Credit: Viking Ship Museum A medieval megaship Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.Read full article Comments",

According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there. At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that's not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches).

The database comes in the form of a rainbow table, which is a precomputed table of hash values linked to their corresponding plaintext. These generic tables, which work against multiple hashing schemes, allow hackers to take over accounts by quickly mapping a stolen hash to its password counterpart. NTLMv1 rainbow tables are particularly easy to construct because of NTLMv1’s limited keyspace, meaning the relatively small number of possible passwords the hashing function allows for. NTLMv1 rainbow tables have existed for two decades but typically require large amounts of resources to make any use of them. New ammo for security pros On Thursday, Mandiant said it had released an NTLMv1 rainbow table that will allow defenders and researchers (and, of course, malicious hackers, too) to recover passwords in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. The table is hosted in Google Cloud. The database works against Net-NTLMv1 passwords, which are used in network authentication for accessing resources such as SMB network sharing.Read full article Comments",
