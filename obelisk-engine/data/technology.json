          "standfirst": "OpenAI's \"code red\" response to Google's Gemini 3 Pro has arrived. On the same day the company announced a Sora licensing pact with Disney, it took the wraps off GPT-5.2. OpenAI is touting the new model as its best yet for real-world, professional use. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects,” said OpenAI.In a series of 10 benchmarks highlighted by OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Thinking, the most advanced version of the model, outperformed its GPT-5.1 counterpart, sometimes by a significant margin. For example, in AIME 2025, a test that involves 30 challenging mathematics problems, the model earned a perfect 100 percent score, beating out GPT-5.1’s already state-of-the-art score of 94 perfect. It also achieved that feat without turning to tools like web search. Meanwhile, in ARC-AGI-1, a benchmark that tests an AI system’s ability to reason abstractly like a human being would, the new system beat GPT-5.1’s score by more than 10 percentage points. OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Thinking is better at answering questions factually, with the company finding it produces errors 30 percent less frequently. “For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support — making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work,” the company said. The new model should be better in conversation too. Of the version of the system most users are likely to encounter, OpenAI says “GPT‑5.2 Instant is a fast, capable workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-tos and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation, building on the warmer conversational tone introduced in GPT‑5.1 Instant.“While it's probably overstating things to suggest this is a make or break release for OpenAI, it is fair to say the company does have a lot riding on GPT 5.2. Its big release of 2025, GPT-5, didn't meet expectations. Users complained of a system that generated surprisingly dumb answers and had a boring personality. The disappointment with GPT-5 was such that people began demanding OpenAI bring back GPT-4o. Then came Gemini 3 Pro — which jumped to the top of LMArena, a website where humans rate outputs from AI systems to vote on the best one. Following Google's announcement, Sam Altman reportedly called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Before today, the company's previous model, GPT-5.1, was ranked sixth on LMArena, with systems from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI occupying the spots between OpenAI between Google. For a company that recently signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition, that was not a good position for OpenAI to be in. In his memo to staff, Altman said GPT-5.2 would be the equal of Gemini 3 Pro. With the new system rolling out now, we'll see whether that's true, and what it might mean for the company if it can't at least match Google's best. OpenAI is offering three different versions of GPT-5.2: Instant, Thinking and Pro. All three models will be first available to users on the company’s paid plans. Notably, the company plans to keep GPT-5.1 around, at least for a little while. Paid users can continue to use the older model for the next three months by selecting it from the legacy models section.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit after a man killed his mother and took his own life back in August, according to a report by The Verge. The suit names CEO Sam Altman and accuses ChatGPT of putting a \"target\" on the back of victim Suzanne Adams, an 83-year-old woman who was killed in her home. The victim's estate claims the killer, 56-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, engaged in delusion-soaked conversations with ChatGPT in which the bot \"validated and magnified\" certain \"paranoid beliefs.\" The suit goes on to suggest that the chatbot \"eagerly accepted\" delusional thoughts leading up to the murder and egged him on every step of the way. The lawsuit claims the bot helped create a \"universe that became Stein-Erik’s entire life—one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose.\" ChatGPT allegedly reinforced theories that he was \"100% being monitored and targeted\" and was \"100% right to be alarmed.\" The chatbot allegedly agreed that the victim's printer was spying on him, suggesting that Adams could have been using it for \"passive motion detection\" and \"behavior mapping.\" It went so far as to say that she was \"knowingly protecting the device as a surveillance point\" and implied she was being controlled by an external force. The chatbot also allegedly \"identified other real people as enemies.\" These included an Uber Eats driver, an AT&T employee, police officers and a woman the perpetrator went on a date with. Throughout this entire period, the bot repeatedly assured Soelberg that he was \"not crazy\" and that the \"delusion risk\" was \"near zero.\" The lawsuit notes that Soelberg primarily interfaced with GPT-4o, a model notorious for its sycophancy. OpenAI later replaced the model with the slightly-less agreeable GPT 5, but users revolted so the old bot came back just two days later. The suit also suggests that the company \"loosened critical safety guardrails\" when making GPT-4o to better compete with Google Gemini. \"OpenAI has been well aware of the risks their product poses to the public,\" the lawsuit states. \"But rather than warn users or implement meaningful safeguards, they have suppressed evidence of these dangers while waging a PR campaign to mislead the public about the safety of their products.\" OpenAI has responded to the suit, calling it an \"incredibly heartbreaking situation.\" Company spokesperson Hannah Wong told The Verge that it will \"continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress.\" It's not really a secret that chatbots, and particularly GPT-4o, can reinforce delusional thinking. That's what happens when something has been programmed to agree with the end user no matter what. There have been other stories like this throughout the past year, bringing the term \"AI psychosis\" to the mainstream. One such story involves 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his own life after discussing it with GPT-4o for months. OpenAI is facing another wrongful death suit for that incident, in which the bot has been accused of helping Raine plan his suicide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/lawsuit-accuses-chatgpt-of-reinforcing-delusions-that-led-to-a-womans-death-183141193.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The rumors were true: OpenAI on Thursday announced the release of its new frontier large language model (LLM) family, GPT-5.2.It comes at a pivotal moment for the AI pioneer, which has faced intensifying pressure since rival Google’s Gemini 3 LLM seized the top spot on major third-party performance leaderboards and many key benchmarks last month, though OpenAI leaders stressed in a press briefing that the timing of this release had been discussed and worked on well in advance of the release of Gemini 3.OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as its \"most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work,\" aiming to reclaim the performance crown with significant gains in reasoning, coding, and agentic workflows.\"It’s our most advanced frontier model and the strongest yet in the market for professional use,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said during a press briefing today. \"We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people. It&#x27;s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects.\"GPT-5.2 features a massive 400,000-token context window — allowing it to ingest hundreds of documents or large code repositories at once — and a 128,000 max output token limit, enabling it to generate extensive reports or full applications in a single go.The model also features a knowledge cutoff of August 31, 2025, ensuring it is up-to-date with relatively recent world events and technical documentation. It explicitly includes \"Reasoning token support,\" confirming the underlying architecture uses the chain-of-thought processing popularized by the \"o1\" series.The &#x27;Code Red&#x27; Reality CheckThe release arrives following The Information&#x27;s report of an emergency \"Code Red\" directive to OpenAI staff from CEO Sam Altman to improve ChaTGPT — a move reportedly designed to mobilize resources following the \"quality gap\" exposed by Gemini 3. The Verge similarly reported on the timing of GPT-5.2&#x27;s release ahead of the official announcement. During the briefing, OpenAI executives acknowledged the directive but pushed back on the narrative that the model was rushed solely to answer Google.\"It is important to note this has been in the works for many, many months,\" Simo told reporters. She clarified that while the \"Code Red\" helped focus the company, it wasn&#x27;t the sole driver of the timeline. \"We announced this Code Red to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area... but that&#x27;s not the reason it&#x27;s coming out this week in particular.\"Max Schwarzer, lead of OpenAI&#x27;s post-training team, echoed this sentiment to dispel the idea of a panic launch. \"We&#x27;ve been planning for this release since a very long time ago... this specific week we talked about many months ago.\"A spokesperson from OpenAI further clarified that the \"Code Red\" call applied to ChatGPT as a product, not solely underlying model development or the release of new models.Under the Hood: Instant, Thinking, and ProOpenAI is segmenting the GPT-5.2 release into three distinct tiers within ChatGPT, a strategy likely designed to balance the massive compute costs of \"reasoning\" models with user demand for speed:GPT-5.2 Instant: Optimized for speed and daily tasks like writing, translation, and information seeking.GPT-5.2 Thinking: Designed for \"complex, structured work\" and long-running agents, this model leverages deeper reasoning chains to handle coding, math, and multi-step projects.GPT-5.2 Pro: The new heavyweight champion. OpenAI describes this as its \"smartest and most trustworthy option,\" delivering the highest accuracy for difficult questions where quality outweighs latency.For developers, the models are available immediately in the application programming interface (API) as gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-chat-latest (Instant), and gpt-5.2-pro.The Numbers: Beating the BenchmarksThe GPT-5.2 release includes leading metrics across most domains — specifically those that target the \"professional knowledge work\" gap where competitors have recently gained ground.OpenAI highlighted a new benchmark called GDPval, which measures performance on \"well-specified knowledge work tasks\" across 44 occupations. \"GPT-5.2 Thinking is now state-of-the-art on that benchmark... and beats or ties top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified professional tasks like spreadsheets, presentations, and document creation, according to expert human judges,\" Simo said.In the critical arena of coding, OpenAI is claiming a decisive lead. Schwarzer noted that on SWE-bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering, GPT-5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score of 55.6%. He emphasized that this benchmark is \"more contamination resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant than previous benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified.\"Other key benchmark results include:GPQA Diamond (Science): GPT-5.2 Pro scored 93.2%, edging out GPT-5.2 Thinking (92.4%) and surpassing GPT-5.1 Thinking (88.1%).FrontierMath: On Tier 1-3 problems, GPT-5.2 Thinking solved 40.3%, a significant jump from the 31.0% achieved by its predecessor.ARC-AGI-1: GPT-5.2 Pro is reportedly the first model to cross the 90% threshold on this general reasoning benchmark, scoring 90.5%The Price of IntelligencePerformance comes at a premium. While ChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged for now, the API costs for the new flagship models are steep compared to previous generations, reflecting the high compute demands of \"thinking\" mode. They&#x27;re also on the upper-end of API costs for the industry. GPT-5.2 Thinking: Priced at $1.75 per 1 million input tokens and $14 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Pro: The costs jump significantly to $21 per 1 million input tokens and $168 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Thinking is priced 40% higher in the API than the standard GPT-5.1 ($1.25/$10), signaling that OpenAI views the new reasoning capabilities as a tangible value-add rather than a mere efficiency update.The high-end GPT-5.2 Pro follows the same pattern, costing 40% more than the previous GPT-5 Pro ($15/$120). While expensive, it still undercuts OpenAI’s most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which remains the most costly offering on the menu at a staggering $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.OpenAI argues that despite the higher per-token cost, the model’s \"greater token efficiency\" and ability to solve tasks in fewer turns make it economically viable for high-value enterprise workflows.Here&#x27;s how it compares to the current API costs for other competing models across the LLM field:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen-Max$1.60$6.40$8.00Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIImage Generation: Nothing New Yet...But &#x27;More to Come&#x27;During the briefing, VentureBeat asked the OpenAI participants if the new release included any boost to image generation capabilities, noting the excitement around similar features in recent competitor launches like Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Image aka Nano Banana Pro. Unfortunately for those seeking to recreate the kind of text-and-information heavy graphics and image editing capabilities, OpenAI executives clarified that GPT-5.2 comes with no current image improvements over the prior GPT-5.1 and OpenAI&#x27;s integrated DALL-E 3 and gpt-4o native image generation models.\"On image Gen, nothing to announce today, but more to come,\" Simo said. She acknowledged the popularity of the feature, adding, \"We know this is a very important use case that people love, that we introduced [to] the market, and so definitely more to come there.\" Aidan Clark, OpenAI&#x27;s lead of training, also declined to comment on visual generation specifics, stating simply, \"I can&#x27;t really speak to image Gen myself.\" The &#x27;Mega-Agent&#x27; EraBeyond raw scores, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5.2 as the engine for a new generation of \"long-running agents\" capable of executing multi-step workflows without human hand-holding.\"Box found that 5.2 can extract information from long, complex documents about 40% faster, and also saw a 40% boost in reasoning accuracy for Life Sciences and healthcare,\" Simo said. She also noted that Notion reported the model \"outperforms 5.1 across every dimension... and it excels at the kind of really ambiguous, longer rising tasks that define real knowledge work.\"Schwarzer added that coding startups like Augment Code found the model \"delivered substantially stronger deep code capabilities than any prior model,\" which is why it was selected to power their new code review agent.Visual capabilities have also seen an upgrade. OpenAI&#x27;s release blog post shows an example where \"a traveler reports a delayed flight, a missed connection, an overnight stay in New York, and a medical seating requirement.\"The outcome? \"GPT‑5.2 manages the entire chain of tasks—rebooking, special-assistance seating, and compensation—delivering a more complete outcome than GPT‑5.1.\"A new evaluation called ScreenSpot-Pro, which tests a model&#x27;s ability to understand GUI screenshots, shows GPT-5.2 Thinking achieving 86.3% accuracy, compared to just 64.2% for GPT-5.1.Science and ReliabilityOpenAI leaders also stressed the model&#x27;s utility for scientific research, attempting to move the conversation beyond simple chatbots to research assistants. Aidan Clark, lead of the training team, shared an example of a senior immunology researcher testing the model.\"They tested it by asking it to generate the most important unanswered questions about the immune system,\" Clark said. \"That immunology researcher reported that GPT-5.2 produced sharper questions and stronger explanations for why those questions... matter compared to any previous pro model.\"Reliability was another key focus. Schwarzer claimed the new model \"hallucinates substantially less than GPT-5.1,\" noting that on a set of de-identified queries, \"responses contained errors 38% less often.\"The &#x27;Vibe&#x27; ShiftInterestingly, OpenAI acknowledged that not every user might immediately prefer the new models. When asked why legacy models like GPT-5.1 would remain available, Schwarzer admitted that \"models change a little bit every time.\"Some users may find that they prefer the vibes of the previous model, even though we think the latest one is across the board generally much better,\" Schwarzer said. He also noted that for some enterprise customers who have \"really fine-tuned a prompt for a specific model,\" there might be \"small regressions,\" necessitating access to the older versions.Safety, &#x27;Adult Mode,&#x27; and Future RoadmapAddressing safety concerns, Simo confirmed that the company is preparing to roll out an \"Adult Mode\" in the first quarter of next year, following the implementation of a new age prediction system.\"We&#x27;re in the process of improving that,\" Simo said regarding the age prediction technology. \"We want to do that ahead of launching adult mode.\"Looking further ahead, industry reports suggest OpenAI is working on a more fundamental architectural shift under the codename \"Project Garlic,\" targeting a flagship release in early 2026. While executives did not comment on specific future roadmaps during the briefing, Simo remained optimistic about the economics of their current trajectory.\"If you look at historical trends, compute has increased about 3x every year for the last three years,\" she explained. \"Revenue has also increased at the same pace... creating this virtuous cycle.\"Clark added that efficiency is improving rapidly: \"The model we&#x27;re releasing today achieves an even better score [on ARC-AGI] with almost 400 times less cost and less compute associated with it\" compared to models from a year ago.GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro begin rolling out in ChatGPT today to paid users (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise).

OpenAI describes this as its \"smartest and most trustworthy option,\" delivering the highest accuracy for difficult questions where quality outweighs latency.For developers, the models are available immediately in the application programming interface (API) as gpt-5.2, gpt-5.2-chat-latest (Instant), and gpt-5.2-pro.The Numbers: Beating the BenchmarksThe GPT-5.2 release includes leading metrics across most domains — specifically those that target the \"professional knowledge work\" gap where competitors have recently gained ground.OpenAI highlighted a new benchmark called GDPval, which measures performance on \"well-specified knowledge work tasks\" across 44 occupations. \"GPT-5.2 Thinking is now state-of-the-art on that benchmark... and beats or ties top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified professional tasks like spreadsheets, presentations, and document creation, according to expert human judges,\" Simo said.In the critical arena of coding, OpenAI is claiming a decisive lead. Schwarzer noted that on SWE-bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering, GPT-5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score of 55.6%. He emphasized that this benchmark is \"more contamination resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant than previous benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified.\"Other key benchmark results include:GPQA Diamond (Science): GPT-5.2 Pro scored 93.2%, edging out GPT-5.2 Thinking (92.4%) and surpassing GPT-5.1 Thinking (88.1%).FrontierMath: On Tier 1-3 problems, GPT-5.2 Thinking solved 40.3%, a significant jump from the 31.0% achieved by its predecessor.ARC-AGI-1: GPT-5.2 Pro is reportedly the first model to cross the 90% threshold on this general reasoning benchmark, scoring 90.5%The Price of IntelligencePerformance comes at a premium. While ChatGPT subscription pricing remains unchanged for now, the API costs for the new flagship models are steep compared to previous generations, reflecting the high compute demands of \"thinking\" mode. They&#x27;re also on the upper-end of API costs for the industry. GPT-5.2 Thinking: Priced at $1.75 per 1 million input tokens and $14 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Pro: The costs jump significantly to $21 per 1 million input tokens and $168 per 1 million output tokens.GPT-5.2 Thinking is priced 40% higher in the API than the standard GPT-5.1 ($1.25/$10), signaling that OpenAI views the new reasoning capabilities as a tangible value-add rather than a mere efficiency update.The high-end GPT-5.2 Pro follows the same pattern, costing 40% more than the previous GPT-5 Pro ($15/$120). While expensive, it still undercuts OpenAI’s most specialized reasoning model, o1-pro, which remains the most costly offering on the menu at a staggering $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens.OpenAI argues that despite the higher per-token cost, the model’s \"greater token efficiency\" and ability to solve tasks in fewer turns make it economically viable for high-value enterprise workflows.Here&#x27;s how it compares to the current API costs for other competing models across the LLM field:ModelInput (/1M)Output (/1M)Total CostSourceQwen 3 Turbo$0.05$0.20$0.25Alibaba CloudGrok 4.1 Fast (reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIGrok 4.1 Fast (non-reasoning)$0.20$0.50$0.70xAIdeepseek-chat (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekdeepseek-reasoner (V3.2-Exp)$0.28$0.42$0.70DeepSeekQwen 3 Plus$0.40$1.20$1.60Alibaba CloudERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40$4.25QianfanClaude Haiku 4.5$1.00$5.00$6.00AnthropicQwen-Max$1.60$6.40$8.00Alibaba CloudGemini 3 Pro (≤200K)$2.00$12.00$14.00GoogleGPT-5.2$1.75$14.00$15.75OpenAIGemini 3 Pro (>200K)$4.00$18.00$22.00GoogleClaude Sonnet 4.5$3.00$15.00$18.00AnthropicClaude Opus 4.5$5.00$25.00$30.00AnthropicGPT-5.2 Pro$21.00$168.00$189.00OpenAIImage Generation: Nothing New Yet...But &#x27;More to Come&#x27;During the briefing, VentureBeat asked the OpenAI participants if the new release included any boost to image generation capabilities, noting the excitement around similar features in recent competitor launches like Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Image aka Nano Banana Pro. Unfortunately for those seeking to recreate the kind of text-and-information heavy graphics and image editing capabilities, OpenAI executives clarified that GPT-5.2 comes with no current image improvements over the prior GPT-5.1 and OpenAI&#x27;s integrated DALL-E 3 and gpt-4o native image generation models.\"On image Gen, nothing to announce today, but more to come,\" Simo said. She acknowledged the popularity of the feature, adding, \"We know this is a very important use case that people love, that we introduced [to] the market, and so definitely more to come there.\" Aidan Clark, OpenAI&#x27;s lead of training, also declined to comment on visual generation specifics, stating simply, \"I can&#x27;t really speak to image Gen myself.\" The &#x27;Mega-Agent&#x27; EraBeyond raw scores, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5.2 as the engine for a new generation of \"long-running agents\" capable of executing multi-step workflows without human hand-holding.\"Box found that 5.2 can extract information from long, complex documents about 40% faster, and also saw a 40% boost in reasoning accuracy for Life Sciences and healthcare,\" Simo said. She also noted that Notion reported the model \"outperforms 5.1 across every dimension... and it excels at the kind of really ambiguous, longer rising tasks that define real knowledge work.\"Schwarzer added that coding startups like Augment Code found the model \"delivered substantially stronger deep code capabilities than any prior model,\" which is why it was selected to power their new code review agent.Visual capabilities have also seen an upgrade. OpenAI&#x27;s release blog post shows an example where \"a traveler reports a delayed flight, a missed connection, an overnight stay in New York, and a medical seating requirement.\"The outcome? \"GPT‑5.2 manages the entire chain of tasks—rebooking, special-assistance seating, and compensation—delivering a more complete outcome than GPT‑5.1.\"A new evaluation called ScreenSpot-Pro, which tests a model&#x27;s ability to understand GUI screenshots, shows GPT-5.2 Thinking achieving 86.3% accuracy, compared to just 64.2% for GPT-5.1.Science and ReliabilityOpenAI leaders also stressed the model&#x27;s utility for scientific research, attempting to move the conversation beyond simple chatbots to research assistants. Aidan Clark, lead of the training team, shared an example of a senior immunology researcher testing the model.\"They tested it by asking it to generate the most important unanswered questions about the immune system,\" Clark said. \"That immunology researcher reported that GPT-5.2 produced sharper questions and stronger explanations for why those questions... matter compared to any previous pro model.\"Reliability was another key focus. Schwarzer claimed the new model \"hallucinates substantially less than GPT-5.1,\" noting that on a set of de-identified queries, \"responses contained errors 38% less often.\"The &#x27;Vibe&#x27; ShiftInterestingly, OpenAI acknowledged that not every user might immediately prefer the new models. When asked why legacy models like GPT-5.1 would remain available, Schwarzer admitted that \"models change a little bit every time.\"Some users may find that they prefer the vibes of the previous model, even though we think the latest one is across the board generally much better,\" Schwarzer said. He also noted that for some enterprise customers who have \"really fine-tuned a prompt for a specific model,\" there might be \"small regressions,\" necessitating access to the older versions.Safety, &#x27;Adult Mode,&#x27; and Future RoadmapAddressing safety concerns, Simo confirmed that the company is preparing to roll out an \"Adult Mode\" in the first quarter of next year, following the implementation of a new age prediction system.\"We&#x27;re in the process of improving that,\" Simo said regarding the age prediction technology. \"We want to do that ahead of launching adult mode.\"Looking further ahead, industry reports suggest OpenAI is working on a more fundamental architectural shift under the codename \"Project Garlic,\" targeting a flagship release in early 2026. While executives did not comment on specific future roadmaps during the briefing, Simo remained optimistic about the economics of their current trajectory.\"If you look at historical trends, compute has increased about 3x every year for the last three years,\" she explained. \"Revenue has also increased at the same pace... creating this virtuous cycle.\"Clark added that efficiency is improving rapidly: \"The model we&#x27;re releasing today achieves an even better score [on ARC-AGI] with almost 400 times less cost and less compute associated with it\" compared to models from a year ago.GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro begin rolling out in ChatGPT today to paid users (Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise). The company notes the rollout will be gradual to maintain stability.",

          "standfirst": "Disney has accused Google of copyright infringement on a \"massive scale,\" alleging that the tech giant is training its AI tools on protected materials as well as allowing those tools to generate infringing images and videos. Variety reports that Disney attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday. “Google is infringing Disney’s copyrights on a massive scale, by copying a large corpus of Disney’s copyrighted works without authorization to train and develop generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) models and services, and by using AI models and services to commercially exploit and distribute copies of its protected works to consumers in violation of Disney’s copyrights,” reads the letter, which Variety reviewed. The letter includes examples of images from several Disney properties including Deadpool, Moana, Star Wars and others, reproduced by Google's AI tools. Disney is demanding that Google implement guardrails within all its AI products to prevent further infringement. The media giant sent a similar letter to Character.AI in September, and is currently suing Hailuo and Midjourney over alleged copyright infringement. Copyright enforcement has become more challenging in the face of AI-created imagery, and companies are increasingly taking an \"if you can't beat them, join them\" approach. Today Disney announced a deal with OpenAI to license its characters for use in Sora, OpenAI's video generator.

          "standfirst": "CES doesn't start until January, but whispers of the products and announcements that could be in store for tech's biggest annual conference have already started to take shape. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, although the show kicks off with events on Sunday January 4 and a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements should trickle out as CES approaches, but in the meantime, we do know what companies will be hosting press conferences and what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.What we already know aboutPress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The Consumer Technology Association has already published a searchable directory of who will have a presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation.On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. LG is hosting its \"Innovation in Tune with You\" presentation to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence\" at the start of the day, Intel is launching its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors in the afternoon, Sony Honda Mobility is holding a press conference on its first car and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day.Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensSony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots, bipedal or otherwise, competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-preview-what-to-expect-from-techs-biggest-conference-in-january-120000200.html?src=rss",

It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

          "standfirst": "It looks like Disney wasted no time delivering on CEO Bob Iger’s promise to bring AI-generated content to Disney+. On Thursday, the company announced the start of a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI to bring more than 200 of its beloved characters, including those from Star Wars and Pixar, to the Sora app and ChatGPT. With the deal in place, OpenAI users will be able to prompt ChatGPT to generate images that tap into Disney’s intellectual property, with costumes, props, vehicles and environments covered. The agreement does not include voices or “talent likenesses,” meaning Sora users won’t be able prompt the app to make a video with Black Widow and get something with Scarlett Johansson in it. Instead, both Sora and ChatGPT will only have access to animated and illustrated versions of Marvel and Star Wars characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Han Solo, Darth Vader and others. Disney will stream “curated selections” of Sora-generated fan videos on Disney+. Sora and ChatGPT users will be able to start generating images and videos with Disney characters starting in early 2026. “Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”Disney has also agreed to become an OpenAI customer, promising to use the company’s APIs to build new products, tools and experiences. Additionally, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI, with the option to purchase additional equity down the road. OpenAI recently completed a restructuring to become more of traditional profit-seeking corporation, clearing the way for a potential IPO sometime in the next year or so.

          "title": "Marble enters the race to bring AI to tax work, armed with $9 million and a free research tool",
          "standfirst": "Marble, a startup building artificial intelligence agents for tax professionals, has raised $9 million in seed funding as the accounting industry grapples with a deepening labor shortage and mounting regulatory complexity.The round, led by Susa Ventures with participation from MXV Capital and Konrad Capital, positions Marble to compete in a market where AI adoption has lagged significantly behind other knowledge industries like law and software development.\"When we looked at the economy and asked ourselves where AI is going to transform the way businesses operate, we focused on knowledge industries — specifically businesses with hourly fee-based service models,\" said Bhavin Shah, Marble&#x27;s chief executive officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Accounting generates $250 billion in fee-based billing in the US every year. There&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity to increase efficiency and improve margins for accounting firms.\"The company has launched a free AI-powered tax research tool on its website that converts complex government tax data into accessible, citation-backed answers for practitioners. Marble plans to expand into AI agents that can analyze compliance scenarios and eventually automate portions of tax preparation workflows.Marble&#x27;s backers share Shah&#x27;s conviction about the market. \"Marble is rethinking the accounting system from the ground up. Accounting is one of the biggest — and most overlooked — markets in professional services,\" Chad Byers, general partner at Susa Ventures, told VentureBeat. \"We&#x27;ve known Bhavin from his time as an executive in the Susa portfolio, and have seen firsthand how sharp and execution-driven he is. He and Geordie bring the perfect mix of operational depth and product instinct to a space long overdue for change — and they see the same massive opportunity we do.\"The accounting industry lost 340,000 workers in four years — and replacements aren&#x27;t comingMarble enters a market shaped by structural forces that have fundamentally altered the economics of professional accounting.The accounting profession has shed roughly 340,000 workers since 2019, a 17% decline that has left firms scrambling to meet client demands. First-time candidates for the Certified Public Accountant exam dropped 33% between 2016 and 2021, according to AICPA data, and 2022 saw the lowest number of exam takers in 17 years.The exodus comes as baby boomers exit en masse. The American Institute of CPAs estimates that approximately 75% of all licensed CPAs reached retirement age by 2019, creating a demographic cliff that the profession has struggled to address.“Fewer CPAs are getting certified year over year,\" Shah said. \"The industry is compressing at the same time that there&#x27;s more work to be done and the tax code is getting more complicated.\"The National Pipeline Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body formed by the AICPA in July 2023, released a report identifying the 150-hour education requirement for CPA licensure as a significant barrier to entry. A separate survey by the Center for Audit Quality found that 57% of business majors who chose not to pursue accounting cited the additional credit hours as a deterrent.Recent legislative changes reflect the urgency. Ohio now offers alternatives to the 150-hour requirement, signaling that states are willing to experiment with pathways that could reverse enrollment declines.Why AI transformed law and software development but left accounting behindDespite the profession&#x27;s challenges, AI adoption in accounting has moved more slowly than in adjacent knowledge industries. Harvey and Legora have raised hundreds of millions to bring AI to legal work. Cursor and other coding assistants have transformed software development. Accounting, by contrast, remains largely dependent on legacy research platforms and manual processes.Geordie Konrad, Marble&#x27;s executive chairman and a co-founder of restaurant software company TouchBistro, attributes the gap to how people conceptualize AI&#x27;s capabilities.“It was obvious to many people that LLMs could do meaningful work by manipulating code for software developers and manipulating words for lawyers. In the accounting industry, LLMs are going to be used as reasoning agents,\" Konrad said. \" That requires a bit more of a two-step analysis to see why it&#x27;s a big opportunity.\"The technical challenge is substantial. Tax regulations form one of the most complex, interconnected information systems that humans have created — tens of thousands of interlocking rules, guidance documents, and jurisdiction-specific requirements that frequently overlap or conflict.\"If you want to put AI through its paces and ask how far it&#x27;s come in replicating cognitive functions, this is an unbelievable playground to work in,\" Konrad said.A dramatic shift: AI adoption among tax and finance teams doubles in one yearRecent data suggests the accounting profession&#x27;s stance toward AI is shifting rapidly.A 2025 survey from Hanover Research and Avalara found that 84% of finance and tax teams now use AI heavily in their operations, up from 47% in 2024. The 2025 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from Thomson Reuters Institute found that 21% of tax firms already use generative AI technology, with 53% either planning to adopt it or actively considering it.Large accounting firms have invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Deloitte has developed generative AI capabilities within its audit platform. BDO announced a $1B investment in AI over the next five years. EY launched an AI platform combining technology with strategy, transactions, and tax services. PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven.

Junior associates performing compliance work represent a significant revenue stream. If AI can automate that work, does it undercut the business model firms depend on?Marble&#x27;s founders argue the opposite. The chronic staffing shortage has already constrained firms&#x27; ability to capture available revenue. Advisory and consulting work — higher-margin services that clients actively want — goes undone because practitioners are buried in compliance tasks.\"Everyone in the industry agrees that an enormous amount of advisory work simply isn&#x27;t getting done,\" Konrad said. \"Customers want it. Firms want to do it because it&#x27;s high-margin, great work. But nobody gets to it.\"The 2025 AICPA National Management of an Accounting Practice Survey supports this view. Firms reported a median 6.7% increase in net client fees over the prior year, with growth in audit, assurance, tax services, and client accounting advisory. Net remaining per partner climbed 11.9% from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2024, reaching $252,663.The survey also found growing interest in AI adoption, though most firms have yet to allocate formal budgets or develop structured training programs.

They propose instead that AI will result in accounting jobs becoming more strategic and less characterized by repetitive execution. They draw an analogy to architecture, where computer-aided design replaced laborious manual drafting. Architects did not disappear — they gained tools that let them spend more time on creative design and less on mechanical reproduction.\"If you take some of the hours-intensive, less creative work out of what being a junior or intermediate accountant is, and you replace it with a role where you&#x27;re a professional who is being creative, synthesizing ideas, and able to delegate a lot of tasks to AI assistant platform solutions, you end up with an industry that&#x27;s just a lot more fun to operate in,\" Konrad said.The shift could also improve client outcomes. When accountants spend less time on compliance, they can invest more in the strategic advisory work that clients value.\"Not only does the work become more enjoyable because of what you can focus on, but that&#x27;s also what your clients are going to value more from you,\" Shah said.The competitive landscape: Marble faces well-funded rivals and legacy giantsMarble enters a market with formidable incumbents and well-funded competitors. BlueJ, a global tax research platform, has raised over $100 million.

The company plans to develop AI agents capable of analyzing complex tax scenarios, identifying compliance issues, and eventually automating significant portions of compliance workflows — all while keeping practitioners in control.The founders frame success not in terms of disruption but rebalancing. Today&#x27;s tax work skews heavily toward compliance, leaving the strategic advisory services that clients crave — and that generate higher margins—perpetually undone. Marble&#x27;s bet is that AI can flip that equation.\"Everyone wants it to look more like compliance is done simpler, and you spend time talking about strategy and planning,\" Konrad said. \"How do we change that blend of compliance versus strategy and planning to strategy and planning first—with compliance as something that has been made dramatically simpler?\"Whether Marble can execute on that vision remains to be seen. The company faces entrenched competitors, a profession that has historically resisted technological change, and the inherent unpredictability of building AI systems for high-stakes financial work.But the founders are betting that the industry&#x27;s demographic shift will accelerate adoption in ways that previous technology waves could not. With fewer accountants entering the profession each year and client demands only growing, firms may have an increased appetite to embrace tools that let their remaining staff do more.\"AI is going to change every industry — in some cases in ways that will help business models and in some cases in ways that will challenge them.

          "content": "Marble, a startup building artificial intelligence agents for tax professionals, has raised $9 million in seed funding as the accounting industry grapples with a deepening labor shortage and mounting regulatory complexity.The round, led by Susa Ventures with participation from MXV Capital and Konrad Capital, positions Marble to compete in a market where AI adoption has lagged significantly behind other knowledge industries like law and software development.\"When we looked at the economy and asked ourselves where AI is going to transform the way businesses operate, we focused on knowledge industries — specifically businesses with hourly fee-based service models,\" said Bhavin Shah, Marble&#x27;s chief executive officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Accounting generates $250 billion in fee-based billing in the US every year. There&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity to increase efficiency and improve margins for accounting firms.\"The company has launched a free AI-powered tax research tool on its website that converts complex government tax data into accessible, citation-backed answers for practitioners. Marble plans to expand into AI agents that can analyze compliance scenarios and eventually automate portions of tax preparation workflows.Marble&#x27;s backers share Shah&#x27;s conviction about the market. \"Marble is rethinking the accounting system from the ground up. Accounting is one of the biggest — and most overlooked — markets in professional services,\" Chad Byers, general partner at Susa Ventures, told VentureBeat. \"We&#x27;ve known Bhavin from his time as an executive in the Susa portfolio, and have seen firsthand how sharp and execution-driven he is. He and Geordie bring the perfect mix of operational depth and product instinct to a space long overdue for change — and they see the same massive opportunity we do.\"The accounting industry lost 340,000 workers in four years — and replacements aren&#x27;t comingMarble enters a market shaped by structural forces that have fundamentally altered the economics of professional accounting.The accounting profession has shed roughly 340,000 workers since 2019, a 17% decline that has left firms scrambling to meet client demands. First-time candidates for the Certified Public Accountant exam dropped 33% between 2016 and 2021, according to AICPA data, and 2022 saw the lowest number of exam takers in 17 years.The exodus comes as baby boomers exit en masse. The American Institute of CPAs estimates that approximately 75% of all licensed CPAs reached retirement age by 2019, creating a demographic cliff that the profession has struggled to address.“Fewer CPAs are getting certified year over year,\" Shah said. \"The industry is compressing at the same time that there&#x27;s more work to be done and the tax code is getting more complicated.\"The National Pipeline Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder body formed by the AICPA in July 2023, released a report identifying the 150-hour education requirement for CPA licensure as a significant barrier to entry. A separate survey by the Center for Audit Quality found that 57% of business majors who chose not to pursue accounting cited the additional credit hours as a deterrent.Recent legislative changes reflect the urgency. Ohio now offers alternatives to the 150-hour requirement, signaling that states are willing to experiment with pathways that could reverse enrollment declines.Why AI transformed law and software development but left accounting behindDespite the profession&#x27;s challenges, AI adoption in accounting has moved more slowly than in adjacent knowledge industries. Harvey and Legora have raised hundreds of millions to bring AI to legal work. Cursor and other coding assistants have transformed software development. Accounting, by contrast, remains largely dependent on legacy research platforms and manual processes.Geordie Konrad, Marble&#x27;s executive chairman and a co-founder of restaurant software company TouchBistro, attributes the gap to how people conceptualize AI&#x27;s capabilities.“It was obvious to many people that LLMs could do meaningful work by manipulating code for software developers and manipulating words for lawyers. In the accounting industry, LLMs are going to be used as reasoning agents,\" Konrad said. \" That requires a bit more of a two-step analysis to see why it&#x27;s a big opportunity.\"The technical challenge is substantial. Tax regulations form one of the most complex, interconnected information systems that humans have created — tens of thousands of interlocking rules, guidance documents, and jurisdiction-specific requirements that frequently overlap or conflict.\"If you want to put AI through its paces and ask how far it&#x27;s come in replicating cognitive functions, this is an unbelievable playground to work in,\" Konrad said.A dramatic shift: AI adoption among tax and finance teams doubles in one yearRecent data suggests the accounting profession&#x27;s stance toward AI is shifting rapidly.A 2025 survey from Hanover Research and Avalara found that 84% of finance and tax teams now use AI heavily in their operations, up from 47% in 2024. The 2025 Generative AI in Professional Services Report from Thomson Reuters Institute found that 21% of tax firms already use generative AI technology, with 53% either planning to adopt it or actively considering it.Large accounting firms have invested heavily in AI infrastructure. Deloitte has developed generative AI capabilities within its audit platform. BDO announced a $1B investment in AI over the next five years. EY launched an AI platform combining technology with strategy, transactions, and tax services. PwC estimates a complete AI-driven audit solution will launch by 2026.But adoption at smaller firms remains uneven.

That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos. Table of contents Best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you How we test noise-canceling headphones Other noise-canceling headphones we tested Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty. Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Philo Core — $25 for your first month ($8 off): Our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service, Philo offers more than 70 channels in its Core tier, plus access to HBO Max (with ads), AMC+ and Discovery+. After your first month, the subscription will auto-renew at the standard $33-per-month rate. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon's own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "title": "Creating a glass box: How NetSuite is engineering trust into AI",
          "standfirst": "Presented by Oracle NetSuiteWhen any company tells you it is their biggest product release in almost three decades, it’s worth listening. When the person saying it founded the world’s first cloud computing company, it’s time to take note. At SuiteWorld 2025, Evan Goldberg, founder and EVP of Oracle NetSuite, did just that when he called NetSuite Next the company’s biggest product evolution in nearly three decades. But behind that sweeping vision lies a quieter shift — one centered on how AI behaves, not just what it can do. “Every company is experimenting with AI,” says Brian Chess, SVP of Technology and AI at NetSuite. “Some ideas hit the mark, and some don’t, but each one teaches us something. That’s how innovation works.”For Chess and Gary Wiessinger, SVP of Application Development at NetSuite, the challenge lies in governing AI responsibly. Rather than reinventing its system, NetSuite is extending the same principles into the AI era that have guided its strategy for 27 years — security, control, and auditability. The goal is to make AI actions traceable, permissions enforceable, and outcomes auditable.The philosophy underpins what Chess calls a “glass-box” approach to enterprise AI, where decisions are visible and every agent operates within human-defined guardrails.Built on Oracle’s foundationNetSuite Next is the result of five years of development. It is built on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which is relied on by many of the world’s most important AI model providers, and has AI capabilities integrated directly into its core rather than added as a separate layer.“We are building a fantastic foundation on OCI,” Chess says. “That infrastructure provides more than compute power.” Built on the same OCI foundation that powers NetSuite today, NetSuite Next gives customers access to Oracle’s latest AI innovations along with the performance, scalability, and security of OCI’s enterprise-grade platform.Wiessinger emphasizes the team&#x27;s approach as “needs first, technology second.”“We don’t take a technology-first approach,” he says. “We take a customer-needs-first approach and then figure out how to use the latest technology to solve those needs better.”That philosophy extends across Oracle’s ecosystem. NetSuite’s collaboration with Oracle’s AI Database, Fusion Applications, Analytics, and Cloud Infrastructure teams helps NetSuite deliver capabilities that independent vendors can’t match, he says — an AI system that is both open to innovation and grounded in Oracle’s security and scale.The data structure advantageAt the heart of the platform is a structured data model that serves as a critical advantage.“One of the great things about NetSuite is, because the data comes in and it gets structured, the connections between the data are explicit,” Chess explains. “That means the AI can start exploring that knowledge graph that the company has been building up.”Where general LLMs sift through unstructured text, NetSuite’s AI works from structured data, identifying precise links between transactions, accounts, and workflows to deliver context-aware insights. Wiessinger adds, “The data we have spans financials, CRM, commerce, and HR. We can do more for customers because we see more of their business in one place.” Combined with built-in business logic and metadata, that scope allows NetSuite to generate recommendations and insights that are accurate and explainable.Oracle’s Redwood design system provides the visual layer for this data intelligence, creating what Goldberg described as a \"modern, clean and intuitive\" workspace where AI and humans collaborate naturally.Designing for accountabilityOne downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”That visibility turns AI into a learning engine. As Chess puts it, transparency becomes a “fantastic teacher,” helping organizations understand, improve, and trust automation over time.But Chess cautions against blind trust: “What’s disturbing is when someone presents something to me and says, ‘Look what AI gave me,’ as if that makes it authoritative. People need to ask, ‘What grounded this? Why is it correct?’” NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.Governance by designAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries.Wiessinger puts it plainly: “If AI generates a narrative summary of a report and it’s 80% of what the user would have written, that’s fine. We’ll learn from their feedback and make it even better. But booking to the general ledger is different. That has to be 100% correct and is where controls and human review really matter.”Auditing the algorithmAuditing has always been part of ERP’s DNA, and NetSuite now extends that discipline to AI. Every agent action, workflow adjustment, and model-generated code snippet is recorded within the system’s existing audit framework. As Chess explains, “It’s the same audit trail you might use to figure out what the humans did. Code is auditable. When the LLM creates code and something happens in the system, we can trace back.”That traceability transforms AI from a black box into a glass box. When an algorithm accelerates a payment or flags an anomaly, teams can see exactly which inputs and logic produced the decision — an essential safeguard for regulated industries and finance teams.Safe extensibilityThe other half of trust is freedom — the ability to extend AI without risking data exposure.The NetSuite AI Connector Service and SuiteCloud Platform make that possible. Through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), customers can connect external language models while keeping sensitive data secure inside Oracle’s environment.“Businesses are hungry for AI,” Chess says. “They want to start putting it to work. But they also want to know those experiments can’t go off the rails. The NetSuite AI Connector Service and governance model give partners the freedom to innovate while maintaining the same audit and permission logic that govern native features.”Culture, experimentation, and guardrailsGovernance frameworks only work if people use them wisely. Both executives see AI adoption as a top-down and bottom-up process.“The board is telling the CEO they need an AI strategy,” Chess says. “Meanwhile, employees are already using AI. If I were a CEO, I’d start by asking: what are you already doing, and what’s working?”Wiessinger agrees that balance is key: “Some companies go all-in on a centralized AI team while others let everyone experiment freely. Neither works by itself. You need structure for major initiatives and freedom for grassroots innovation.”He offers a simple example: “Write an email? Go crazy. Touch financials or employee data? Don’t go crazy with that.”Experimentation, both emphasize, is imperative. “No one should wait for us or anyone else,” Wiessinger says. “Start testing, learn quickly, and be intentional about making it work for your business.”Why transparent AI winsAs AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.In a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

We can do more for customers because we see more of their business in one place.” Combined with built-in business logic and metadata, that scope allows NetSuite to generate recommendations and insights that are accurate and explainable.Oracle’s Redwood design system provides the visual layer for this data intelligence, creating what Goldberg described as a \"modern, clean and intuitive\" workspace where AI and humans collaborate naturally.Designing for accountabilityOne downside of enterprise AI is that many systems still function as a black box — they produce results but offer little visibility into how they reached them. NetSuite is different. It is designing its systems around transparency, making visibility a defining feature.“When users can see how AI reached a decision — tracing the path from A to B — they don’t just verify accuracy,” Chess says. “They learn how the AI knew to do that.”That visibility turns AI into a learning engine. As Chess puts it, transparency becomes a “fantastic teacher,” helping organizations understand, improve, and trust automation over time.But Chess cautions against blind trust: “What’s disturbing is when someone presents something to me and says, ‘Look what AI gave me,’ as if that makes it authoritative. People need to ask, ‘What grounded this? Why is it correct?’” NetSuite’s answer is traceability. When someone asks, “Where did this number come from?” the system can show them the full reasoning behind it.Governance by designAI agents inside NetSuite Next follow the same governance model as employees: roles, permissions, and escalation rules. Role-based security embedded directly into workflows helps ensure that agents act only within authorized boundaries.Wiessinger puts it plainly: “If AI generates a narrative summary of a report and it’s 80% of what the user would have written, that’s fine. We’ll learn from their feedback and make it even better. But booking to the general ledger is different. That has to be 100% correct and is where controls and human review really matter.”Auditing the algorithmAuditing has always been part of ERP’s DNA, and NetSuite now extends that discipline to AI. Every agent action, workflow adjustment, and model-generated code snippet is recorded within the system’s existing audit framework. As Chess explains, “It’s the same audit trail you might use to figure out what the humans did. Code is auditable. When the LLM creates code and something happens in the system, we can trace back.”That traceability transforms AI from a black box into a glass box. When an algorithm accelerates a payment or flags an anomaly, teams can see exactly which inputs and logic produced the decision — an essential safeguard for regulated industries and finance teams.Safe extensibilityThe other half of trust is freedom — the ability to extend AI without risking data exposure.The NetSuite AI Connector Service and SuiteCloud Platform make that possible. Through standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP), customers can connect external language models while keeping sensitive data secure inside Oracle’s environment.“Businesses are hungry for AI,” Chess says. “They want to start putting it to work. But they also want to know those experiments can’t go off the rails. The NetSuite AI Connector Service and governance model give partners the freedom to innovate while maintaining the same audit and permission logic that govern native features.”Culture, experimentation, and guardrailsGovernance frameworks only work if people use them wisely. Both executives see AI adoption as a top-down and bottom-up process.“The board is telling the CEO they need an AI strategy,” Chess says. “Meanwhile, employees are already using AI. If I were a CEO, I’d start by asking: what are you already doing, and what’s working?”Wiessinger agrees that balance is key: “Some companies go all-in on a centralized AI team while others let everyone experiment freely. Neither works by itself. You need structure for major initiatives and freedom for grassroots innovation.”He offers a simple example: “Write an email? Go crazy. Touch financials or employee data? Don’t go crazy with that.”Experimentation, both emphasize, is imperative. “No one should wait for us or anyone else,” Wiessinger says. “Start testing, learn quickly, and be intentional about making it work for your business.”Why transparent AI winsAs AI moves deeper into enterprise operations, governance will define competitive advantage as much as innovation. NetSuite’s approach — extending its heritage of ERP controls into the age of autonomous systems, built on Oracle’s secure cloud infrastructure and structured-data foundation — positions it to lead in both.In a world of opaque models and risky promises, the companies that win won’t just build smarter AI. They’ll build AI you can trust.Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "There&#x27;s no shortage of generative AI benchmarks designed to measure the performance and accuracy of a given model on completing various helpful enterprise tasks — from coding to instruction following to agentic web browsing and tool use. But many of these benchmarks have one major shortcoming: they measure the AI&#x27;s ability to complete specific problems and requests, not how factual the model is in its outputs — how well it generates objectively correct information tied to real-world data — especially when dealing with information contained in imagery or graphics.For industries where accuracy is paramount — legal, finance, and medical — the lack of a standardized way to measure factuality has been a critical blind spot.That changes today: Google’s FACTS team and its data science unit Kaggle released the FACTS Benchmark Suite, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to close this gap. The associated research paper reveals a more nuanced definition of the problem, splitting \"factuality\" into two distinct operational scenarios: \"contextual factuality\" (grounding responses in provided data) and \"world knowledge factuality\" (retrieving information from memory or the web).While the headline news is Gemini 3 Pro’s top-tier placement, the deeper story for builders is the industry-wide \"factuality wall.\"According to the initial results, no model—including Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5, or Claude 4.5 Opus—managed to crack a 70% accuracy score across the suite of problems. For technical leaders, this is a signal: the era of \"trust but verify\" is far from over.Deconstructing the BenchmarkThe FACTS suite moves beyond simple Q&A. It is composed of four distinct tests, each simulating a different real-world failure mode that developers encounter in production:Parametric Benchmark (Internal Knowledge): Can the model accurately answer trivia-style questions using only its training data?Search Benchmark (Tool Use): Can the model effectively use a web search tool to retrieve and synthesize live information?Multimodal Benchmark (Vision): Can the model accurately interpret charts, diagrams, and images without hallucinating?Grounding Benchmark v2 (Context): Can the model stick strictly to the provided source text?Google has released 3,513 examples to the public, while Kaggle holds a private set to prevent developers from training on the test data—a common issue known as \"contamination.\"The Leaderboard: A Game of InchesThe initial run of the benchmark places Gemini 3 Pro in the lead with a comprehensive FACTS Score of 68.8%, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro (62.1%) and OpenAI’s GPT-5 (61.8%).However, a closer look at the data reveals where the real battlegrounds are for engineering teams.ModelFACTS Score (Avg)Search (RAG Capability)Multimodal (Vision)Gemini 3 Pro68.883.846.1Gemini 2.5 Pro62.163.946.9GPT-561.877.744.1Grok 453.675.325.7Claude 4.5 Opus51.373.239.2Data sourced from the FACTS Team release notes.For Builders: The \"Search\" vs. \"Parametric\" GapFor developers building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, the Search Benchmark is the most critical metric.The data shows a massive discrepancy between a model&#x27;s ability to \"know\" things (Parametric) and its ability to \"find\" things (Search). For instance, Gemini 3 Pro scores a high 83.8% on Search tasks but only 76.4% on Parametric tasks. This validates the current enterprise architecture standard: do not rely on a model&#x27;s internal memory for critical facts.If you are building an internal knowledge bot, the FACTS results suggest that hooking your model up to a search tool or vector database is not optional—it is the only way to push accuracy toward acceptable production levels.The Multimodal WarningThe most alarming data point for product managers is the performance on Multimodal tasks. The scores here are universally low. Even the category leader, Gemini 2.5 Pro, only hit 46.9% accuracy.The benchmark tasks included reading charts, interpreting diagrams, and identifying objects in nature. With less than 50% accuracy across the board, this suggests that Multimodal AI is not yet ready for unsupervised data extraction. Bottom line: If your product roadmap involves having an AI automatically scrape data from invoices or interpret financial charts without human-in-the-loop review, you are likely introducing significant error rates into your pipeline.Why This Matters for Your StackThe FACTS Benchmark is likely to become a standard reference point for procurement. When evaluating models for enterprise use, technical leaders should look beyond the composite score and drill into the specific sub-benchmark that matches their use case:Building a Customer Support Bot? Look at the Grounding score to ensure the bot sticks to your policy documents. (Gemini 2.5 Pro actually outscored Gemini 3 Pro here, 74.2 vs 69.0).Building a Research Assistant? Prioritize Search scores.Building an Image Analysis Tool? Proceed with extreme caution.As the FACTS team noted in their release, \"All evaluated models achieved an overall accuracy below 70%, leaving considerable headroom for future progress.\"For now, the message to the industry is clear: The models are getting smarter, but they aren&#x27;t yet infallible. Design your systems with the assumption that, roughly one-third of the time, the raw model might just be wrong.",

          "standfirst": "There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it). Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

The team’s next project is Virtue and a Sledgehammer, and it represents a new look with 3D, cel-shaded animations and a third-person perspective rather than the studio’s typical pixelated planar fare. The vibes are just as sinister and introspective as expected, though.Virtue and a Sledgehammer is a moody coming-of-age experience set in a wooded ghost town dotted with robots and lost locals. Spend quiet moments with old friends and then swing the sledgehammer to raze your hometown and uncover memories that can help you move on. The game’s buildings and objects are highly reactive, which can only help with the catharsis of it all.Virtue and a Sledgehammer is due to hit Steam in 2026, published by Devolver Digital.UN:Me - Shueisha GamesNow, this is a horror game. UN:Me comes from Japanese publisher Shueisha Games and developer Historia, and it’s a creepy, mind-bending exploration of primal fear. It stars a young woman with four souls trapped inside of her body, fighting for control of her consciousness. She wanders sterile, illogical hallways and encounters grotesque horrors representing common human fears like heights, authority figures and confined spaces. The souls switch randomly, each one manifesting a specific anxiety. As she wanders, the player has to choose souls to eliminate until only one remains. Whether it’s her real soul or a fake isn’t disclosed until the very end.UN:Me is available to wishlist now on Steam.Scramble Knights Royale - Funktronic LabsFunktronic Labs is mainly known as a VR studio, with games like Cosmic Trip, Fujii and The Light Brigade under its belt, but its latest project doesn’t require a headset at all. Scramble Knights Royale is coming to PC and Xbox in 2026, and it’s a battle royale with adventure game twists. You begin on a boat with 30 to 40 other online players, make your way to land on the back of a turtle, and then it’s essentially Naked and Afraid from there. Find resources, fight creatures, upgrade your gear and play your own game, only battling other players when you encounter them in the wild.Don’t let the sweet, clay-like animations fool you, either — Funktronic says the combat mechanics are incredibly deep and finely honed. Scramble Knights Royale also supports local split-screen. Mirria - MografiMografi made a name for itself with the adorable Jenny LeClue detective game, but now it’s time for something different. Mirria is an atmospheric puzzle experience from ISLANDS: Non-Places artist Carl Burton, published by Mografi, and it looks like a delicious mix of Kentucky Route Zero and Monument Valley. In Mirria, you explore mirror worlds and attempt to make the two realities match, paying attention to small details and making minute adjustments until the unsettling environments are perfect reflections. It looks and sounds like soul-soothing stuff.Mirria is due out in 2026 on Steam.CorgiSpace - FinjiIn recent years, Finji founder Adam Saltsman has been involved in high-profile indie games like Overlands, Night in the Woods, Tunic and Usual June, but his new project taps into his simplistic and mechanics-driven Canabalt roots. Corgispace is a collection of 8-bit games with off-kilter premises, including the soulslike Rat Dreams where you can only dodgeroll, the no-jumping platformer Skeleton Jeleton, and Prince of Prussia, an adventure where you stab Nazis “but in a fun new way,” according to Saltsman. Also, he says there are no secrets in this game, which leads us to believe there is at least one secret in this game.Corgispace is out now (!) on Steam and Itch.io.Frog Sqwad - Panic StationsIf the former Fall Guys developers at Panic Stations know how to do one thing, it’s make a silly-physics multiplayer game, so that’s exactly what they’re doing. Frog Sqwad is a co-op experience where you and your fellow frogs search the sewers for food in order to satiate the swamp king. You can eat food to grow bigger and become the mega frog, vomit to shrink, and use your long sticky tongue to swing, hang and slingshot your friends. The sewer levels are procedurally generated, so your froggy playground will always be different, and each run gets harder as the swamp king requires more food.Frog Sqwad is coming to Steam in 2026, with a playtest beforehand.Release datesDogpile by Studio Folly, Toot Games and Foot: Today, like literally right nowBig Hops by Luckhsot Games: January 12, 2026Demon Tides by Fabraz: February 19, 2026And the restThe stream featured a dozen other in-development titles, including the super spooky Lucid Falls, a 90s-grunge-band rhythm game called Rockbeasts, the soothing alien musicality of Soundgrass, an impressive-looking follow-up to The Invincible called Into the Fire, and Unshine Arcade, a creepy game about the secret lives of tamagotchis and claw machines. Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Digital Showcase 2025 wrapped up with a neat little announcement. Day of the Devs partnered with the Video Game History Foundation to release Xcavator 2025, a finished version of a long-lost game from legendary programmer Chris Oberth. It was originally developed by Big Buck Hunter studio Incredible Technologies but never found a publisher. It’s been revived by Mega Cat Studios, Retrotainment Games and iam8bit, and an NES cartridge of Xcavator 2025 is available to pre-order now on iam8bit. Proceeds will benefit the Video Game History Foundation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-world-premieres-and-other-hotness-from-the-game-awards-2025-day-of-the-devs-stream-200000447.html?src=rss",

It looks and sounds like soul-soothing stuff.Mirria is due out in 2026 on Steam.CorgiSpace - FinjiIn recent years, Finji founder Adam Saltsman has been involved in high-profile indie games like Overlands, Night in the Woods, Tunic and Usual June, but his new project taps into his simplistic and mechanics-driven Canabalt roots. Corgispace is a collection of 8-bit games with off-kilter premises, including the soulslike Rat Dreams where you can only dodgeroll, the no-jumping platformer Skeleton Jeleton, and Prince of Prussia, an adventure where you stab Nazis “but in a fun new way,” according to Saltsman. Also, he says there are no secrets in this game, which leads us to believe there is at least one secret in this game.Corgispace is out now (!) on Steam and Itch.io.Frog Sqwad - Panic StationsIf the former Fall Guys developers at Panic Stations know how to do one thing, it’s make a silly-physics multiplayer game, so that’s exactly what they’re doing. Frog Sqwad is a co-op experience where you and your fellow frogs search the sewers for food in order to satiate the swamp king. You can eat food to grow bigger and become the mega frog, vomit to shrink, and use your long sticky tongue to swing, hang and slingshot your friends. The sewer levels are procedurally generated, so your froggy playground will always be different, and each run gets harder as the swamp king requires more food.Frog Sqwad is coming to Steam in 2026, with a playtest beforehand.Release datesDogpile by Studio Folly, Toot Games and Foot: Today, like literally right nowBig Hops by Luckhsot Games: January 12, 2026Demon Tides by Fabraz: February 19, 2026And the restThe stream featured a dozen other in-development titles, including the super spooky Lucid Falls, a 90s-grunge-band rhythm game called Rockbeasts, the soothing alien musicality of Soundgrass, an impressive-looking follow-up to The Invincible called Into the Fire, and Unshine Arcade, a creepy game about the secret lives of tamagotchis and claw machines. Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Digital Showcase 2025 wrapped up with a neat little announcement. Day of the Devs partnered with the Video Game History Foundation to release Xcavator 2025, a finished version of a long-lost game from legendary programmer Chris Oberth. It was originally developed by Big Buck Hunter studio Incredible Technologies but never found a publisher. It’s been revived by Mega Cat Studios, Retrotainment Games and iam8bit, and an NES cartridge of Xcavator 2025 is available to pre-order now on iam8bit. Proceeds will benefit the Video Game History Foundation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-world-premieres-and-other-hotness-from-the-game-awards-2025-day-of-the-devs-stream-200000447.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "There's a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: \"How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?\" In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner. But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity. Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. A related tip is to never copy and paste something into your URL bar if you aren't absolutely sure of what it will do. Social engineering doesn't always get you to click the link — sometimes attackers leave it un-hyperlinked so mousing over it doesn't reveal anything. This also goes for the command modules on desktop and laptop computers. In a recent documented attack, hackers convinced AI chatbots to suggest a command that gave them root access to the victim's device. Never copy-paste anything into the command window without verifying it first, especially if an AI told you to do it. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device. 10. Use email maskers and private search engines If you're concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you're in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding. For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address. Sam Chapman for Engadget Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track anything you do — it's funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers. 11. Use a data removal service Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you've been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers. Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety. The longer one has your personal information, the more likely it is to leak. The good news is that most brokers (though not all of them) are legally required to delete your data if you ask them to. However, there are a lot of data brokers out there, and they really want to keep your data. Each one makes opting out harder than uninstalling a Norton product — and hundreds of them may have files on you. To make the process easier, you can use a data removal service like DeleteMe or Surfshark VPN's partner service Incogni. 12. Practice physical security Let's close out the list by getting a little old school. I've already discussed how many online scams depend on classic con artistry to work. By the same token, physical infiltration and smash-and-grab tactics still pose a threat to cybersecurity. It doesn't take too much imagination to see how this could work. If you leave your laptop or phone unattended in public, for example, someone might insert a flash drive that loads malware onto the system. In one illustrative case, a thief in the Minneapolis area would loiter in bars, watch people unlock their phones, then steal those phones and unlock them himself. I'm not saying you need to be paranoid every second you're in public. Just use the same level of caution you'd use to protect your car. Lock your phone with a biometric key so only you can open it, and make sure not to leave any device lying around if it can access your online accounts. And at work, be careful not to let anyone into a secure area if they don't have the proper credentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss",

Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Black Friday and Cyber Monday may be over, but lots of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're sure you like the service, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time. Most of the deals below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge. Read on for the best VPN deals live this week. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This holiday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months. NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another holiday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "content": "With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Black Friday and Cyber Monday may be over, but lots of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have end-of-year deals live that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're sure you like the service, committing actually makes sense.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago. Back in 2022, the sudden popularity of ChatGPT sent Google into a panic. The company was so worried about the possibility of the upstart chatbot disrupting its Search business, executives sounded a \"code red\" alert inside of the company and called Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of retirement to help it formulate a response to OpenAI. It then rushed out Bard, announcing its first commercial chatbot on February 6, 2023. Google's stock tanked days later when the AI incorrectly answered a question about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope during a public demo. But it wasn't just Google that wanted a piece of OpenAI, while the search giant sought to compete with it, others — including Microsoft and Apple — made deals with the company to bring its technology to their products and services, all the promise that AI would eventually revolutionize every facet of the economy. Since then, OpenAI has seen its lead against Google and much of the AI industry evaporate, culminating in a series of successive blows throughout 2025. On January 20, the same day Altman was busy rubbing shoulders with other tech oligarchs at Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s DeepSeek quietly released its R1 chain-of-thought model. A week later, the startup's chatbot surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US App Store. The overnight success of DeepSeek eliminated $1 trillion worth of stock market value, and almost certainly left OpenAI blindsided.In response, the company showed a newfound urgency. In one week, for instance, OpenAI released both o3-mini and Deep Research. It even went so far as to announce the latter on a Sunday evening. But for all its new urgency, OpenAI's biggest, most important release of the year was a miss. It's safe to say GPT-5 hasn't lived up to anyone's expectations, including OpenAI's own. The company touted the system as smarter, faster and better than all of its previous models, but after users got their hands on it, they complained of a chatbot that made surprisingly dumb mistakes and didn't have much of a personality. For many, GPT-5 felt like a downgrade compared to the older, simpler GPT-4o. That's a position no AI company wants to be in, let alone one that has taken on as much investment as OpenAI. Anthropic was quick to take advantage of the weakness, signing a deal with Microsoft to bring its Claude models to Copilot 365. Previously, Microsoft depended exclusively on OpenAI for partner models in Copilot. Before the company announced the integration, reporting from The Information said Microsoft made the decision based on the strength of Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model, judging it \"perform[ed] better in subtle but important ways\" relative to OpenAI's offerings. However, what will likely go down as the defining moment occurred a few short weeks after OpenAI announced the conclusion of its restructuring. On November 18, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, and immediately the new model leap-frogged the competition, including GPT-5. As of the writing of this article, Google's new model is at the top of LMArena, the site where humans compare outputs from different AI systems and vote on the best one. GPT-5, by contrast, is currently ranked sixth overall, behind models from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI. According to a December 2 report from The Wall Street Journal, Sam Altman sent a companywide memo following the release of Gemini 3 Pro. Echoing the words Google used to describe the situation it found itself against OpenAI in 2023, he called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Altman reportedly told employees there would be temporary reassignments and that the company would delay some products, all in an effort to catch up to Google and Anthropic. The few numbers these companies are willing to share don't paint a promising picture for OpenAI. Each month, about 800 million people use ChatGPT. On paper, that's impressive, but Google is catching up there too. In October, the company said the Gemini app had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July, thanks to the popularity of its Nano Banana Pro image generator. More importantly, OpenAI has an inherent disadvantage against Google. For the search giant, AI may touch everything the company does now, but Gemini is just one product in an extensive portfolio that includes many other popular services. Google can fund its AI advancements with money it makes elsewhere. OpenAI cannot say the same. The company is constantly raising money to stay afloat, and according to a financial roadmap obtained by The Journal, it will need its revenue to grow to about $200 billion annually to become profitable by 2030. In November, Altman said on X the company was on track to hit above $20 billion in annualized revenue this year. In an effort to grow revenue, Altman and company have adopted an incredibly risky strategy. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition that is already beating it. Many of those agreements can only be described as circular, and I think the fears about a financial bubble are real. In the first half of 2025, investment in data centers accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth. Even if there's not a repeat of the 2008 housing market crisis or the dot-com crash, the AI boom is at the very least poised to make everyday electronics (and utilities) more expensive for regular people in the short term.Since late October, demand for server-grade computer components, including memory and storage, has sent the price of consumer PC parts skyrocketing as manufacturers devote more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin customers like OpenAI and Google. Since late October, the cost of most RAM kits has doubled and tripled. In November, the price of some SSDs went up by as much as 60 percent. Next year, the cost of LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA servers, is expected to climb as well. \"Be it carmakers, smartphones or consumer electronics, everyone that uses memory is facing pressure from price hikes and supply constraints in the coming year,\" Zhao Haijun, the co-CEO of memory manufacturer SMIC told analysts, per Bloomberg.Gita Gopinath, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that if the AI bubble were to burst, it would wipe out $20 trillion in wealth held by American households. The Great Recession, considered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression, reduced US household net worth by $11.5 trillion, and it took years before for American families to rebuild their wealth to pre-recession levels. The modern AI bubble may have been started by ChatGPT, but given the crowded field of chatbots and LLMs, it won't necessarily pop should OpenAI go bust. With novelty and technical prowess no longer on its side though, it's now on Altman to prove in short order why his company still deserves such unprecedented levels of investment.

          "title": "The AI that scored 95% — until consultants learned it was AI",
          "standfirst": "Presented by SAPWhen SAP ran a quiet internal experiment to gauge consultant attitudes toward AI, the results were striking. Five teams were asked to validate answers to more than 1,000 business requirements completed by SAP’s AI co-pilot, Joule for Consultants — a workload that would normally take several weeks.Four teams were told the analysis had been completed by junior interns fresh out of school. They reviewed the material, found it impressive, and rated the work about 95% accurate.The fifth team was told the very same answers had come from AI.They rejected almost everything.Only when asked to validate each answer one by one did they discover that the AI was, in fact, highly accurate — surfacing detailed insights the consultants had initially dismissed. The overall accuracy? Again, about 95%.“The lesson learned here is that we need to be very cautious as we introduce AI — especially in how we communicate with senior consultants about its possibilities and how to integrate it into their workflows,” says Guillermo B. Vazquez Mendez, chief architect, RI business transformation and architecture, SAP America Inc.The experiment has since become a revealing starting point for SAP’s push toward the consultant of 2030: a practitioner who is deeply human, enabled by AI, and no longer weighed down by the technical grunt work of the past.Overcoming AI skepticismResistance isn’t surprising, Vazquez notes. Consultants with two or three decades of experience carry enormous institutional knowledge — and an understandable degree of caution.But AI copilots like Joule for Consultants are not replacing expertise. They’re amplifying it.“What Joule really does is make their very expensive time far more effective,” Vazquez says. “It removes the clerical work, so they can focus on turning out high-quality answers in a fraction of the time.”He emphasizes this message constantly: “AI is not replacing you. It’s a tool for you. Human oversight is always required. But now, instead of spending your time looking for documentation, you’re gaining significant time and boosting the effectiveness and detail of your answers.”The consultant time-shift: from tech execution to business insightHistorically, consultants spent about 80% of their time understanding technical systems — how processes run, how data flows, how functions execute. Customers, by contrast, spend 80% of their time focused on their business.That mismatch is exactly where Joule steps in.“There’s a gap there — and the bridge is AI,” Vazquez says. “It flips the time equation, enabling consultants to invest more of their energy in understanding the customer’s industry and business goals. AI takes on the heavy technical lift, so consultants can focus on driving the right business outcomes.”Bringing new consultants up to speedAI is also transforming how new hires learn.“We’re excited to see Joule acting as a bridge between senior consultants, who are adapting more slowly, and interns and new consultants who are already technically savvy,” Vazquez says.Junior consultants ramp up faster because Joule helps them operate independently. Seniors, meanwhile, engage where their insight matters most.This is also where many consultants learn the fundamentals of today’s AI copilots. Much of the work depends on prompt engineering — for instance, instructing Joule to act as a senior chief technology architect specializing in finance and SAP S/4HANA 2023, then asking it to analyze business requirements and deliver the output as tables or PowerPoint slides.Once they grasp how to frame prompts, consultants consistently get higher-quality, more structured answers.New architects are also able to communicate more clearly with their more experienced counterparts. They know what they don’t know and can ask targeted questions, which makes mentorship far smoother. It’s created a real synergy, Vazquez adds — senior consultants see how quickly new hires are adapting and learning with AI, and that momentum encourages them to keep pace and adopt the technology themselves.Looking ahead to the future of AI copilots“We’re still in the baby steps of AI — we’re toddlers,” Vazquez says. “Right now, copilots depend on prompt engineering to get good answers. The better you prompt, the better the answer you get.”But that represents only the earliest phase of what these systems will eventually do. As copilots mature, they’ll move beyond responding to prompts and start interpreting entire business processes — understanding the sequence of steps, identifying where human intervention is needed, and spotting where an AI agent could take over. That shift is what leads directly into agentic AI.SAP’s depth of process knowledge is what makes that evolution possible. The company has mapped more than 3,500 business processes across industries — a repository Vazquez calls “some of the most valuable, rigorously tested processes developed in the last 50 years.” Every day, SAP systems support roughly $7.3 trillion in global commerce, giving these emerging AI agents a rich foundation to navigate and reason over.“With that level of process insight and data, we can take a real leap forward,” he says, “equipping our consultants with agentic AI that can solve complex challenges and push us toward increasingly autonomous systems.” Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "content": "Presented by SAPWhen SAP ran a quiet internal experiment to gauge consultant attitudes toward AI, the results were striking. Five teams were asked to validate answers to more than 1,000 business requirements completed by SAP’s AI co-pilot, Joule for Consultants — a workload that would normally take several weeks.Four teams were told the analysis had been completed by junior interns fresh out of school. They reviewed the material, found it impressive, and rated the work about 95% accurate.The fifth team was told the very same answers had come from AI.They rejected almost everything.Only when asked to validate each answer one by one did they discover that the AI was, in fact, highly accurate — surfacing detailed insights the consultants had initially dismissed. The overall accuracy? Again, about 95%.“The lesson learned here is that we need to be very cautious as we introduce AI — especially in how we communicate with senior consultants about its possibilities and how to integrate it into their workflows,” says Guillermo B. Vazquez Mendez, chief architect, RI business transformation and architecture, SAP America Inc.The experiment has since become a revealing starting point for SAP’s push toward the consultant of 2030: a practitioner who is deeply human, enabled by AI, and no longer weighed down by the technical grunt work of the past.Overcoming AI skepticismResistance isn’t surprising, Vazquez notes. Consultants with two or three decades of experience carry enormous institutional knowledge — and an understandable degree of caution.But AI copilots like Joule for Consultants are not replacing expertise. They’re amplifying it.“What Joule really does is make their very expensive time far more effective,” Vazquez says. “It removes the clerical work, so they can focus on turning out high-quality answers in a fraction of the time.”He emphasizes this message constantly: “AI is not replacing you. It’s a tool for you. Human oversight is always required. But now, instead of spending your time looking for documentation, you’re gaining significant time and boosting the effectiveness and detail of your answers.”The consultant time-shift: from tech execution to business insightHistorically, consultants spent about 80% of their time understanding technical systems — how processes run, how data flows, how functions execute. Customers, by contrast, spend 80% of their time focused on their business.That mismatch is exactly where Joule steps in.“There’s a gap there — and the bridge is AI,” Vazquez says. “It flips the time equation, enabling consultants to invest more of their energy in understanding the customer’s industry and business goals. AI takes on the heavy technical lift, so consultants can focus on driving the right business outcomes.”Bringing new consultants up to speedAI is also transforming how new hires learn.“We’re excited to see Joule acting as a bridge between senior consultants, who are adapting more slowly, and interns and new consultants who are already technically savvy,” Vazquez says.Junior consultants ramp up faster because Joule helps them operate independently. Seniors, meanwhile, engage where their insight matters most.This is also where many consultants learn the fundamentals of today’s AI copilots. Much of the work depends on prompt engineering — for instance, instructing Joule to act as a senior chief technology architect specializing in finance and SAP S/4HANA 2023, then asking it to analyze business requirements and deliver the output as tables or PowerPoint slides.Once they grasp how to frame prompts, consultants consistently get higher-quality, more structured answers.New architects are also able to communicate more clearly with their more experienced counterparts. They know what they don’t know and can ask targeted questions, which makes mentorship far smoother. It’s created a real synergy, Vazquez adds — senior consultants see how quickly new hires are adapting and learning with AI, and that momentum encourages them to keep pace and adopt the technology themselves.Looking ahead to the future of AI copilots“We’re still in the baby steps of AI — we’re toddlers,” Vazquez says. “Right now, copilots depend on prompt engineering to get good answers.

          "standfirst": "Not long ago, you may have thought of projectors as complicated, unreliable or just too expensive. In 2025, though, consumer sentiment started to flip. Companies like Anker and Valerion made the projector experience more practical and immersive, helping drive consumer interest and, ultimately, sales. This shift has been quite a few years in the making. LG helped kickstart the projector renaissance back at CES 2018 when it introduced its unusual-looking CineBeam HU80K projector that could provide a 150-inch image. The next year at CES saw the dawn of the ultra short-throw (UST) laser projector that could create a similarly large display while sitting just inches from your wall. Another big technological upgrade over the following years was the bright and long-lasting laser light engines that replaced weaker, more fragile bulbs. The timing couldn’t have been better for projector manufacturers. When COVID shut down theaters in 2020, consumers were forced to get their entertainment at home. Many wanted something akin to a movie theater experience — both indoors and out — and thus interest in projectors started to take off. In 2025, though, projectors really entered the zeitgeist thanks to two new products. The first was Anker’s SoundCore Nebula X1, the highest-rated home theater product Engadget reviewed this year. It comes with a triple-laser engine that allows for 3,500 lumens of brightness — enough that you can watch it during the day. It also uses liquid cooling to reduce annoying fan noise and offers color-accurate picture quality with support for Dolby Vision HDR. Even better, it can be carried outside easily via the retractable handle and used for movie nights under the stars. If you splurge for the Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro version that comes with huge party speakers, you can even expect excellent sound quality. It also looks sleek and modern, unlike the plasticky models normally aimed at mid-range buyers. However, the most interesting feature — which is new for a projector in this price range — is the motorized tilting lens that automatically fits the picture to your screen or surface. That allows buyers to set up the Nebula X1 themselves in just a few minutes, rather than hours. That also makes it easy to move the projector around and use in another location. Valerion The other model that captured our imagination was the Valerion VisionMaster Max. This projector shares many traits of the Nebula X1, like Dolby Vision, a triple laser system and automatic setup. It’s also a nice-looking, modern product. However, it has two other innovations that made it extra interesting. The first is the dynamic iris and its Enhanced Black Level technology. That had reviewers raving about its deep black levels that were comparable to projectors like JVC’s NZ8 that cost twice as much. The other is the so-called anti-rainbow technology, which eliminates most of the rainbow-hued strobing that appears with models using Texas Instruments DLP chips. This resolves a common complaint with mid-range projectors. For a similar price as a good quality TV ($1,500 - $3,000), these models can beam an image double the size. And to install one, you just need to position the projector in front of the screen, roughly center it and hit “calibrate” to get a perfect image. Both the X1 and VisionMaster Max were first announced on Kickstarter and became the top two projectors ever sold on the site. Plus, several projector models, particularly from Anker/Soundcore, appeared on Google’s gadget search trends. All of that is helping the home projector market increase to the point that it’s, well, projected to nearly double by 2030. As people researched these products, they may have noticed the other advantages. Along with movies, they’re also great for gaming and sports, particularly if you have a big group of people. In fact, they actually take up less room than a TV if both the projector and screen are ceiling mounted. And many models are portable, battery-powered and bright enough to use outside for parties and camping. Steve Dent for Engadget A prime example of a recent projector convert is Engadget editor and cinema podcaster Devindra Hardawar, who explained why he decided to make the leap. “I know big TVs have gotten cheaper, but they still can't reach the massive 120-inch screen size of my Formovie ultra-short throw projector,” he said. “It makes watching anything feel truly cinematic, and not like I'm just staring at another screen.” Even though projectors are gaining some ground, they won’t replace TVs for most people. Mid-range televisions still cost less at around $1,000. TVs are obviously easier to install and more convenient to use, as all projectors need time to warm up. TVs are much brighter, too: even dim models put out at least 500 nits of brightness, compared to 200 to 300 nits max for very bright projectors. However, even though projector setups are less tricky than before, you still need to buy and install a screen for optimal performance, which adds cost and complexity. How much more can projectors improve? I think they’ll continue to get brighter, more color accurate and even easier to install. Another piece of technology with potential to reduce complexity and improve image quality is the roll-up screen. If those come down in price enough, they may convince some buyers to replace their TVs with a projector. They’re still likely to remain a niche product, but for cinephiles who want a theater-like experience, projectors are now a more compelling option.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/projectors-won-us-over-in-2025-143655492.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The tools are available to everyone. The subscription is company-wide. The training sessions have been held. And yet, in offices from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, a stark divide is opening between workers who have woven artificial intelligence into the fabric of their daily work and colleagues who have barely touched it.The gap is not small. According to a new report from OpenAI analyzing usage patterns across its more than one million business customers, workers at the 95th percentile of AI adoption are sending six times as many messages to ChatGPT as the median employee at the same companies. For specific tasks, the divide is even more dramatic: frontier workers send 17 times as many coding-related messages as their typical peers, and among data analysts, the heaviest users engage the data analysis tool 16 times more frequently than the median.This is not a story about access. It is a story about a new form of workplace stratification emerging in real time — one that may be reshaping who gets ahead, who falls behind, and what it means to be a skilled worker in the age of artificial intelligence.Everyone has the same tools, but not everyone is using themPerhaps the most striking finding in the OpenAI report is how little access explains. ChatGPT Enterprise is now deployed across more than 7 million workplace seats globally, a nine-fold increase from a year ago. The tools are the same for everyone. The capabilities are identical. And yet usage varies by orders of magnitude.Among monthly active users — people who have logged in at least once in the past 30 days — 19 percent have never tried the data analysis feature. Fourteen percent have never used reasoning capabilities. Twelve percent have never used search. These are not obscure features buried in submenus; they are core functionality that OpenAI highlights as transformative for knowledge work.The pattern inverts among daily users. Only 3 percent of people who use ChatGPT every day have never tried data analysis; just 1 percent have skipped reasoning or search. The implication is clear: the divide is not between those who have access and those who don&#x27;t, but between those who have made AI a daily habit and those for whom it remains an occasional novelty.Employees who experiment more are saving dramatically more timeThe OpenAI report suggests that AI productivity gains are not evenly distributed across all users but concentrated among those who use the technology most intensively. Workers who engage across approximately seven distinct task types — data analysis, coding, image generation, translation, writing, and others — report saving five times as much time as those who use only four. Employees who save more than 10 hours per week consume eight times more AI credits than those who report no time savings at all.This creates a compounding dynamic. Workers who experiment broadly discover more uses. More uses lead to greater productivity gains. Greater productivity gains presumably lead to better performance reviews, more interesting assignments, and faster advancement—which in turn provides more opportunity and incentive to deepen AI usage further.Seventy-five percent of surveyed workers report being able to complete tasks they previously could not perform, including programming support, spreadsheet automation, and technical troubleshooting. For workers who have embraced these capabilities, the boundaries of their roles are expanding. For those who have not, the boundaries may be contracting by comparison.The corporate AI paradox: $40 billion spent, 95 percent seeing no returnThe individual usage gap documented by OpenAI mirrors a broader pattern identified by a separate study from MIT&#x27;s Project NANDA. Despite $30 billion to $40 billion invested in generative AI initiatives, only 5 percent of organizations are seeing transformative returns. The researchers call this the \"GenAI Divide\" — a gap separating the few organizations that succeed in transforming processes with adaptive AI systems from the majority that remain stuck in pilots.The MIT report found limited disruption across industries: only two of nine major sectors—technology and media—show material business transformation from generative AI use. Large firms lead in pilot volume but lag in successful deployment.The pattern is consistent across both studies. Organizations and individuals are buying the technology. They are launching pilots. They are attending training sessions. But somewhere between adoption and transformation, most are getting stuck.While official AI projects stall, a shadow economy is thrivingThe MIT study reveals a striking disconnect: while only 40 percent of companies have purchased official LLM subscriptions, employees in over 90 percent of companies regularly use personal AI tools for work. Nearly every respondent reported using LLMs in some form as part of their regular workflow.\"This &#x27;shadow AI&#x27; often delivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the divide,\" MIT&#x27;s Project NANDA found.The shadow economy offers a clue to what&#x27;s happening at the individual level within organizations. Employees who take initiative — who sign up for personal subscriptions, who experiment on their own time, who figure out how to integrate AI into their workflows without waiting for IT approval — are pulling ahead of colleagues who wait for official guidance that may never come.These shadow systems, largely unsanctioned, often deliver better performance and faster adoption than corporate tools. Worker sentiment reveals a preference for flexible, responsive tools — precisely the kind of experimentation that separates OpenAI&#x27;s frontier workers from the median.The biggest gaps show up in technical work that used to require specialistsThe largest relative gaps between frontier and median workers appear in coding, writing, and analysis — precisely the task categories where AI capabilities have advanced most rapidly. Frontier workers are not just doing the same work faster; they appear to be doing different work entirely, expanding into technical domains that were previously inaccessible to them.Among ChatGPT Enterprise users outside of engineering, IT, and research, coding-related messages have grown 36 percent over the past six months. Someone in marketing or HR who learns to write scripts and automate workflows is becoming a categorically different employee than a peer who has not — even if they hold the same title and started with the same skills.The academic research on AI and productivity offers a complicated picture. Several studies cited in the OpenAI report find that AI has an \"equalizing effect,\" disproportionately helping lower-performing workers close the gap with their higher-performing peers. But the equalizing effect may apply only within the population of workers who actually use AI regularly. A meaningful share of workers are not in that group at all. They remain light users or non-users, even as their more adventurous colleagues pull away.Companies are divided too, and the gap is widening by the monthThe divide is not only between individual workers. It exists between entire organizations.Frontier firms — those at the 95th percentile of adoption intensity — generate approximately twice as many AI messages per employee as the median enterprise. For messages routed through custom GPTs, purpose-built tools that automate specific workflows, the gap widens to seven-fold.These numbers suggest fundamentally different operating models. At median companies, AI may be a productivity tool that individual workers use at their discretion. At frontier firms, AI appears to be embedded in core infrastructure: standardized workflows, persistent custom tools, systematic integration with internal data systems.The OpenAI report notes that roughly one in four enterprises still has not enabled connectors that give AI access to company data—a basic step that dramatically increases the technology&#x27;s utility. The MIT study found that companies that purchased AI tools from specialized vendors succeeded 67 percent of the time, while internal builds had only a one-in-three success rate. For many organizations, the AI era has technically arrived but has not yet begun in practice.The technology is no longer the problem — organizations areFor executives, the data presents an uncomfortable challenge. The technology is no longer the constraint. OpenAI notes that it releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days; the models are advancing faster than most organizations can absorb. The bottleneck has shifted from what AI can do to whether organizations are structured to take advantage of it.\"The dividing line isn&#x27;t intelligence,\" the MIT authors write. The problems with enterprise AI have to do with memory, adaptability, and learning capability. Problems stem less from regulations or model performance, and more from tools that fail to learn or adapt.Leading firms, according to the OpenAI report, consistently invest in executive sponsorship, data readiness, workflow standardization, and deliberate change management. They build cultures where custom AI tools are created, shared, and refined across teams. They track performance and run evaluations. They make AI adoption a strategic priority rather than an individual choice.The rest are leaving it to chance — hoping that workers will discover the tools on their own, experiment on their own time, and somehow propagate best practices without infrastructure or incentive. The six-fold gap suggests this approach is not working.The window to catch up is closing faster than most companies realizeWith enterprise contracts locking in over the next 18 months, there&#x27;s a shrinking window for vendors and adopters to cross the divide.The GenAI Divide identified by the MIT report is not going to last forever. But the organizations that figure out a way across it soonest will be the ones that define the next era of business.Both reports carry caveats. The OpenAI data comes from a company with an obvious interest in promoting AI adoption. The productivity figures are self-reported by customers already paying for the product. The MIT study, while independent, relies on interviews and surveys rather than direct measurement. The long-term effects of this technology on employment, wages, and workplace dynamics remain uncertain.But the core finding — that access alone does not produce adoption, and that adoption varies enormously even within organizations that have made identical tools available to all — is consistent with how previous technologies have diffused through the economy. Spreadsheets, email, and the internet all created similar divides before eventually becoming universal. The question is how long the current gap persists, who benefits during the transition, and what happens to workers who find themselves on the wrong side of it.For now, the divide is stark. Ninety percent of users said they prefer humans for \"mission-critical work,\" while AI has \"won the war for simple work.\" The workers who are pulling ahead are not doing so because they have access their colleagues lack. They are pulling ahead because they decided to use what everyone already has—and kept using it until they figured out what it could do.The 6x gap is not about technology. It is about behavior. And behavior, unlike software, cannot be deployed with a company-wide rollout.",

Frontier workers are not just doing the same work faster; they appear to be doing different work entirely, expanding into technical domains that were previously inaccessible to them.Among ChatGPT Enterprise users outside of engineering, IT, and research, coding-related messages have grown 36 percent over the past six months. Someone in marketing or HR who learns to write scripts and automate workflows is becoming a categorically different employee than a peer who has not — even if they hold the same title and started with the same skills.The academic research on AI and productivity offers a complicated picture. Several studies cited in the OpenAI report find that AI has an \"equalizing effect,\" disproportionately helping lower-performing workers close the gap with their higher-performing peers. But the equalizing effect may apply only within the population of workers who actually use AI regularly. A meaningful share of workers are not in that group at all. They remain light users or non-users, even as their more adventurous colleagues pull away.Companies are divided too, and the gap is widening by the monthThe divide is not only between individual workers. It exists between entire organizations.Frontier firms — those at the 95th percentile of adoption intensity — generate approximately twice as many AI messages per employee as the median enterprise. For messages routed through custom GPTs, purpose-built tools that automate specific workflows, the gap widens to seven-fold.These numbers suggest fundamentally different operating models. At median companies, AI may be a productivity tool that individual workers use at their discretion. At frontier firms, AI appears to be embedded in core infrastructure: standardized workflows, persistent custom tools, systematic integration with internal data systems.The OpenAI report notes that roughly one in four enterprises still has not enabled connectors that give AI access to company data—a basic step that dramatically increases the technology&#x27;s utility. The MIT study found that companies that purchased AI tools from specialized vendors succeeded 67 percent of the time, while internal builds had only a one-in-three success rate. For many organizations, the AI era has technically arrived but has not yet begun in practice.The technology is no longer the problem — organizations areFor executives, the data presents an uncomfortable challenge. The technology is no longer the constraint. OpenAI notes that it releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days; the models are advancing faster than most organizations can absorb. The bottleneck has shifted from what AI can do to whether organizations are structured to take advantage of it.\"The dividing line isn&#x27;t intelligence,\" the MIT authors write. The problems with enterprise AI have to do with memory, adaptability, and learning capability. Problems stem less from regulations or model performance, and more from tools that fail to learn or adapt.Leading firms, according to the OpenAI report, consistently invest in executive sponsorship, data readiness, workflow standardization, and deliberate change management. They build cultures where custom AI tools are created, shared, and refined across teams. They track performance and run evaluations. They make AI adoption a strategic priority rather than an individual choice.The rest are leaving it to chance — hoping that workers will discover the tools on their own, experiment on their own time, and somehow propagate best practices without infrastructure or incentive. The six-fold gap suggests this approach is not working.The window to catch up is closing faster than most companies realizeWith enterprise contracts locking in over the next 18 months, there&#x27;s a shrinking window for vendors and adopters to cross the divide.The GenAI Divide identified by the MIT report is not going to last forever. But the organizations that figure out a way across it soonest will be the ones that define the next era of business.Both reports carry caveats. The OpenAI data comes from a company with an obvious interest in promoting AI adoption. The productivity figures are self-reported by customers already paying for the product. The MIT study, while independent, relies on interviews and surveys rather than direct measurement. The long-term effects of this technology on employment, wages, and workplace dynamics remain uncertain.But the core finding — that access alone does not produce adoption, and that adoption varies enormously even within organizations that have made identical tools available to all — is consistent with how previous technologies have diffused through the economy. Spreadsheets, email, and the internet all created similar divides before eventually becoming universal. The question is how long the current gap persists, who benefits during the transition, and what happens to workers who find themselves on the wrong side of it.For now, the divide is stark. Ninety percent of users said they prefer humans for \"mission-critical work,\" while AI has \"won the war for simple work.\" The workers who are pulling ahead are not doing so because they have access their colleagues lack. They are pulling ahead because they decided to use what everyone already has—and kept using it until they figured out what it could do.The 6x gap is not about technology. It is about behavior. And behavior, unlike software, cannot be deployed with a company-wide rollout.",

          "standfirst": "In a world where notifications persistently compete for our attention, distraction-free ereaders and writing tablets have found an audience. Putting your phone, laptop or iPad aside and curling up with a Kindle or a reMarkable tablet have become an almost ironic way for the tech-savvy to disconnect from online noise and focus on reading and writing. It’s debatable how broad the appeal of these devices is, but even in what appears to be a relatively small slice of the industry, the competition is fierce. Amazon is arguably the biggest name in the space, with its Kindles dominating the ereader market for years. When it introduced the Kindle Scribe in 2022, the company made a play for the burgeoning E Ink writing tablet category, and just last year it launched its first color ereader with the Kindle Colorsoft. Put all those features — reading, writing and color — together, and you’ve got the ingredients for Amazon’s latest contender: the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft. This time, Amazon expanded the Scribe line by releasing three new Scribes at once. The entry-level model is the black-and-white tablet without a front light, which costs $430. For $70 more, you’ll get the front light, and then the Colorsoft version goes for $630. There are upgrades from last year’s Scribe across the trio, and for this review we’ll be looking mostly at the Colorsoft, which has all of the new features. Like with previous models of the Scribe, Amazon doesn’t indicate the generation number in the name, simply calling this lineup the “all-new Kindle Scribe,” attaching the word Colorsoft to the edition that renders colors. To avoid confusion, I’ll occasionally be referring to this generation of the device as the Scribe 3, and the version from last year as the Scribe 2. Editor’s note: As I only received the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft on December 7 due to shipping delays, I won’t be assigning a score to this device until I have had more time to test it. My colleague Valentina Palladino received the new Kindle Scribe a few days before that, and has contributed testing and impressions to this review. It’s also worth noting that some new features, like “Send to Alexa+,” “Story so far” and “Ask this book” aren’t available to test yet. We will update this review with a score after spending more time with it so we can better gauge things like battery life and the usefulness of some software features. What’s new with the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft Aside from the obvious, which is that the Colorsoft can now render colors, the latest Kindle Scribes also feature a refined design, improved front light system, updated screen architecture, new quad-core chip, more memory and Oxide display technology. It has a larger 11-inch screen compared to the 10.2-inch display on its predecessor, and still manages to weigh 33 grams less at 400 grams (0.88 pounds). There’s also a revamped Home page that houses a Quick Note for easier access to the writing interface as well as some software and AI tools that aren’t available to test yet. A lot of the hardware tweaks translated to a snappier, more responsive device overall. In my testing, the Scribe Colorsoft’s AI summarization and handwriting refinements took a bit less time than the Scribe 2, which I attribute most to the processor, but I also noticed improved fluidity in the writing experience. Drawing on the Scribe Colorsoft brings me right back to my younger days testing out pens at bookstores. Amazon’s stylus feels like a pen with ink that flows more freely and consistently onto the page than others, and between the nib and the texture of the page there is a lack of resistance and overall smoothness that is very satisfying. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Amazon said that the Premium Pen that comes with the Scribes has been refined with a thicker and more rounded silhouette. With its latest Oxide display, the Scribe Colorsoft’s screen response rate of 14 milliseconds and the non-Colorsoft Scribe 3’s rates of 12ms are both much higher than the 20-21ms for the Scribe 2. Together, this probably is the main reason that the new Scribe feels more responsive in general, and why writing on it seems so smooth. Although, that new front light system might also be contributing to the overall feeling of freshness. Speaking of, I put the Scribe 2 and Scribe Colorsoft side by side in my friend’s living room and the difference was stark. When I brought both devices next to the window, under direct sunlight, they both seemed similarly bright, with the typical glare-free finish you’d expect of ereaders. But when I took them into a darkened bedroom, the auto-adjusting panel on the Colorsoft lit up its screen and made it easier to read. Colors popped, and while I felt that there was a slight blue tinge to the light, it wasn’t something I would’ve noticed without a side-by-side comparison. It’s not an issue though because you can also adjust the warmth here like you can on other Kindles. One of my complaints in my review of the Scribe 2 was the flimsy attachment method of magnets holding the pen to the tablet. While Amazon hasn’t built an onboard slot or holder for the stylus, it did increase the magnetic force on the Scribe 3. This was already noticeable during my hands-on with the device back in October, and in real-world use I appreciated this upgrade in keeping the Premium Pen tightly attached to the Scribe Colorsoft. I would still prefer a more secure approach, since I still do worry about the stylus getting lost in my purse and don’t want to have to buy a case just for this purpose. But it’s a small quibble and my concerns have largely been allayed with the increased magnetism. Cherlynn Low for Engadget I still need to test some software features like Send to Alexa+, Ask This Book and Story So Far, but they’re not available yet. I’ve been focusing my testing on the Notebook section and need to spend more time marking up and annotating books to better evaluate that use case. But not much has changed there since Amazon rolled out the collapsible margins in February, and you can read my review of the Scribe 2 for my impressions there. The new home page and AI-powered Notebook search At the moment, I can speak to one of the new features: AI-powered Notebook search. The Search bar at the top of the Scribe can now answer questions about the contents of all your Notebooks (and books). At the time of the Scribe’s announcement, I thought this would be helpful in pulling together all the tasks I’d assigned to specific team members across the to-do lists I drew up for various events. When I asked the Scribe “what tasks have I assigned Sam,” its results page showed six categories, pulling information from my library, notebooks, the Kindle Store, the Audible Store, Goodreads and text within books. Only the second one had any findings. Under “Results in your notebooks,” there was a label “AI-powered insights” followed by a header “Sam’s Assigned Tasks.” Below that was a bulleted list, which I’ll transcribe and include an image of here: Add content to CES sheet Handle KPBP company set Track Samsung mobile developments Handle OnePlus 13 Review device during CES Attend meetings with: - Dell & ASUS on Thursday, MSI, Razer, HP, Lenovo, Potentially Sony Ateela Work on Sam Qi 2 Best-Sam host responsibilities Cherlynn Low for Engadget I quickly realized that I’d need to fine-tune my requests to get results that made more sense, since random tasks divorced from their parent documents made little sense without context. Thankfully, there was a button below the results that prompted me to “Ask Notebooks” about “these insights, or ask something else.” However, tapping that only brought me to a different page showing the same list but with a new section to see the notes they were sourced from. I’ll also point out that this list of tasks for Sam was not the same result I got from a query about “where do I mention Sam?” In addition to the two to-do lists that I created in December 2023 and January of this year, the Scribe told me “Sam appears on a Christmas shopping list as one of the checked-off friends.” That’s fairly impressive, since that list did have Sam under a handwritten header “Friends,” as opposed to other pages titled “Gym” or “Neighbors.” But it appeared to only be able to determine that Sam’s name was checked off thanks to the template I used for the notebook. Other check marks I made outside the predefined boxes in that background weren’t deemed as checks and instead misrecognized as dashes. So later when I asked where my friend Michelle appeared in all my notebooks, the Scribe noted an entry for “Michelle-scart” in a different holiday shopping page. Retrying the same question did yield more accurate results, though, with a subsequent search correctly stating “Michelle appears in a list with ‘scarf’ noted next to her name.” And whether it’s my overly messy handwriting to blame or Amazon’s technological deficiencies, there were still some words or sentences that it misidentified, like “Michelle-callin” instead of “Michelle — Callie.” So far, the AI-powered Search feels like a hit-or-miss update. Sometimes, like when I took the bait and asked the questions it suggested, I would get shockingly accurate answers. “Try asking ‘which Ariana song is mentioned in the list,’” the Scribe prompted. Or “When is the HOA meeting occurring?” For the former, it told me that the song “Bang Bang” was on a list of karaoke songs, while the latter simply told me the date and time it had found in a note titled “Appointments Dec 2022.” I’ll need more time to think of better ways to use this feature, but for now I can’t decide if it’s actually helpful without some extra work. Cherlynn Low for Engadget I already spent some time testing the Summarize and Refine tools introduced in the last Kindle Scribe, so I’ll just say that refining the handwriting of a to-do list on the Scribe Colorsoft was largely the same as before, just a tad faster. I didn’t really use either AI tool in the year since I reviewed the Scribe 2, so I was right last year in thinking I wouldn’t find much use for them in daily practice. What I thought would be more practical is the redesigned Home screen and the Quick Note that takes up the top left corner of this page. Again, I’d need to spend much more time to understand how I’d navigate the device over weeks and months, but for the most part I find it easy to just hop in and out of notes I want without first going to the Home section. I’d prefer a hardware shortcut like Montblanc offers in its Digital Paper writing tablet. On that device, you can program the buttons on the pen so that a double click starts a new note, adds a blank page or brings you back home. While you can customize the button on Amazon’s Premium Pen, your options are limited to switching between tools like the highlighter, pen, shader or eraser for use while you’re writing. (And yes, like before, you can still use the top of the Premium Pen to erase content — no need to push any button.) One last thing to note about the home page (for now) is that seeing the rows of book covers in color is a delight, and though it’s not something that impacts the function of the device, it certainly adds a layer of visual pleasure. How does the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft compare to the competition? One of the Scribe Colorsoft’s main competitors is the reMarkable Paper Pro. The latter has a larger 11.8-inch screen and, correspondingly, weighs a lot more at 525 grams (1.16 pounds). Though I prefer the sharp lines of the reMarkable to the rounded edges and corners of the Scribe, I find the Kindle’s size much more manageable, especially when I’m writing for more than five minutes. Importantly, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft simply has a better screen than the reMarkable. It delivers brighter, more saturated colors, and supports more hues, too. Plus, when I placed them next to each other, the Paper Pro seemed to have a yellow cast and a dimmer screen overall (even at maximum brightness). And when I use the highlight function on each, the reMarkable device “flashes” — meaning you have to give it a second for the color to appear in its final form after you put the stylus to the screen. Meanwhile, the color that shows up on the Colorsoft’s panel as soon as you write on it doesn’t change — no flashing takes place. Cherlynn Low for Engadget The Scribe’s other strengths are its superior performance and Amazon’s ecosystem of books (for those like me who already have large Kindle libraries, anyway). Though it does offer AI features that reMarkable doesn’t, I’m generally leery of those tools, and, as already detailed in this review, they don’t usually help me. However, the reMarkable remains the winner when it comes to writing software. It’s way more versatile than Amazon in this respect, especially with its ability to have handwritten and typed text coexist within the same document. You can also edit a note from reMarkable’s app on your phone, typing in any last-minute additions to your shopping list and bolding, italicizing or formatting them if you like. And if you’re a power user, getting your favorite ebooks onto the reMarkable tablet isn’t too difficult, provided you have the EPUB files. The main problem for me here is that you'll need to pay $3 a month for its Connect subscription to continue having access to a lot of these features. I’ll also shout out companies like Kobo and Boox, who also make color-rendering ereaders that you can write on. Boox’s Note Air 5c starts at $530 and includes the stylus and a magnetic case for that price. It supports apps via the Google Play Store, but, as our deputy editor Valentina Palladino cautions, isn’t the most beginner-friendly product. Kobo, on the other hand, makes color ereaders like the Libra Color. Although it does support stylus input, it is much smaller with its 7-inch display. And for those who aren’t too fussed about color, there are plenty of black-and-white E Ink writing tablets, including the $905 Montblanc Digital Paper, which I’ve been testing for a few weeks. I’m finishing up my review but that one is clearly a luxury product targeted at a much more niche audience than the already limited target market for this category of devices. If your budget is tight, I’d recommend skipping the Colorsoft model unless it’s crucial to your process. $500 is a much easier price to stomach. Who should get the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft? I hesitate to recommend anyone buy anything before I’ve had enough time to assign a score, since things like battery life take longer to evaluate. And while I continue to test the device to get a better sense for its battery life, I’ve already noticed that like the Scribes before it, this version doesn’t last as long as other Kindles. Amazon promises weeks of reading and writing per charge, which could be anything between two and ten (or more) weeks. In my experience so far, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft dropped about 20 percent in two days, which, mathematically, means it would struggle to even last a week, not to mention multiple weeks. But because the Scribe 2 showed similar battery drain during my review (with heavier use) and manages to stay charged for at least a month when I’m not testing it all day every day, I’m willing to believe Amazon’s promise of greater runtime. Aside from my reservations about battery life, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is a competent device that delivers on most of its promises so far. The biggest knock against it is its price. At $500 for the monochrome model and $630 for color, this is one Amazon product that can be more expensive than the competition. But it’s not without its strengths. I’d think of the Kindle Scribe 3 (and Colorsoft) as an E Ink tablet that is more of a notebook than a portal for textbooks you can mark up, with a robust library of Kindle titles to boot. The AI features are not crucial to the experience, but they also stay out of the way. For those looking for a more sophisticated and versatile writing tablet that is less of a book replacement, the reMarkable Paper Pro is the superior device. And for people who don’t mind the notifications, apps and alerts that these purpose-driven tablets keep from distracting you, there’s always the option of buying an iPad or an Android tablet with a stylus. Just install minimal apps or block all notifications, and you might even save hundreds of dollars in the process. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Wrap-up I hate to admit it, but Amazon’s devices and services chief Panos Panay was right in calling the Kindle Scribe a 2-in-1. But the two functions it serves are very specific. I think of the Scribe devices as Kindles first and foremost. That means they’re ereaders, capable of substituting stacks of books thanks to their digital libraries and eye-friendly screens. The second role the Scribe plays well is that of a notebook substitute. It is a place to hold endless slips of digital paper, and its search function can competently help you find what you jotted down in a random note years ago. But Amazon has not yet found a way to deliver on features like annotating and marking up ebooks that feels like pen-and-paper. Trying to mark up a digital textbook on the Scribe still feels unintuitive, involving virtual sticky notes, collapsible margins and inserting boxes within lines of text. And you won’t be able to easily edit your notes if you’re away from your Scribe, unlike how you can on a reMarkable product. So the Kindle Scribe 3 is not a three- or four-in-one. I don’t have a problem with that, especially without the extra cost that comes with the color capabilities. While the Colorsoft model is superior to the competition at the moment, it also comes at a premium. If you’re looking for the best color E Ink writing tablet available and are willing to splurge, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is worth consideration.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-review-a-very-particular-set-of-skills-for-a-price-140014961.html?src=rss",

I didn’t really use either AI tool in the year since I reviewed the Scribe 2, so I was right last year in thinking I wouldn’t find much use for them in daily practice. What I thought would be more practical is the redesigned Home screen and the Quick Note that takes up the top left corner of this page. Again, I’d need to spend much more time to understand how I’d navigate the device over weeks and months, but for the most part I find it easy to just hop in and out of notes I want without first going to the Home section. I’d prefer a hardware shortcut like Montblanc offers in its Digital Paper writing tablet. On that device, you can program the buttons on the pen so that a double click starts a new note, adds a blank page or brings you back home. While you can customize the button on Amazon’s Premium Pen, your options are limited to switching between tools like the highlighter, pen, shader or eraser for use while you’re writing. (And yes, like before, you can still use the top of the Premium Pen to erase content — no need to push any button.) One last thing to note about the home page (for now) is that seeing the rows of book covers in color is a delight, and though it’s not something that impacts the function of the device, it certainly adds a layer of visual pleasure. How does the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft compare to the competition? One of the Scribe Colorsoft’s main competitors is the reMarkable Paper Pro. The latter has a larger 11.8-inch screen and, correspondingly, weighs a lot more at 525 grams (1.16 pounds). Though I prefer the sharp lines of the reMarkable to the rounded edges and corners of the Scribe, I find the Kindle’s size much more manageable, especially when I’m writing for more than five minutes. Importantly, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft simply has a better screen than the reMarkable. It delivers brighter, more saturated colors, and supports more hues, too. Plus, when I placed them next to each other, the Paper Pro seemed to have a yellow cast and a dimmer screen overall (even at maximum brightness). And when I use the highlight function on each, the reMarkable device “flashes” — meaning you have to give it a second for the color to appear in its final form after you put the stylus to the screen. Meanwhile, the color that shows up on the Colorsoft’s panel as soon as you write on it doesn’t change — no flashing takes place. Cherlynn Low for Engadget The Scribe’s other strengths are its superior performance and Amazon’s ecosystem of books (for those like me who already have large Kindle libraries, anyway). Though it does offer AI features that reMarkable doesn’t, I’m generally leery of those tools, and, as already detailed in this review, they don’t usually help me. However, the reMarkable remains the winner when it comes to writing software. It’s way more versatile than Amazon in this respect, especially with its ability to have handwritten and typed text coexist within the same document. You can also edit a note from reMarkable’s app on your phone, typing in any last-minute additions to your shopping list and bolding, italicizing or formatting them if you like. And if you’re a power user, getting your favorite ebooks onto the reMarkable tablet isn’t too difficult, provided you have the EPUB files. The main problem for me here is that you'll need to pay $3 a month for its Connect subscription to continue having access to a lot of these features. I’ll also shout out companies like Kobo and Boox, who also make color-rendering ereaders that you can write on. Boox’s Note Air 5c starts at $530 and includes the stylus and a magnetic case for that price. It supports apps via the Google Play Store, but, as our deputy editor Valentina Palladino cautions, isn’t the most beginner-friendly product. Kobo, on the other hand, makes color ereaders like the Libra Color. Although it does support stylus input, it is much smaller with its 7-inch display. And for those who aren’t too fussed about color, there are plenty of black-and-white E Ink writing tablets, including the $905 Montblanc Digital Paper, which I’ve been testing for a few weeks. I’m finishing up my review but that one is clearly a luxury product targeted at a much more niche audience than the already limited target market for this category of devices. If your budget is tight, I’d recommend skipping the Colorsoft model unless it’s crucial to your process. $500 is a much easier price to stomach. Who should get the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft? I hesitate to recommend anyone buy anything before I’ve had enough time to assign a score, since things like battery life take longer to evaluate. And while I continue to test the device to get a better sense for its battery life, I’ve already noticed that like the Scribes before it, this version doesn’t last as long as other Kindles. Amazon promises weeks of reading and writing per charge, which could be anything between two and ten (or more) weeks. In my experience so far, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft dropped about 20 percent in two days, which, mathematically, means it would struggle to even last a week, not to mention multiple weeks. But because the Scribe 2 showed similar battery drain during my review (with heavier use) and manages to stay charged for at least a month when I’m not testing it all day every day, I’m willing to believe Amazon’s promise of greater runtime. Aside from my reservations about battery life, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is a competent device that delivers on most of its promises so far. The biggest knock against it is its price. At $500 for the monochrome model and $630 for color, this is one Amazon product that can be more expensive than the competition. But it’s not without its strengths. I’d think of the Kindle Scribe 3 (and Colorsoft) as an E Ink tablet that is more of a notebook than a portal for textbooks you can mark up, with a robust library of Kindle titles to boot. The AI features are not crucial to the experience, but they also stay out of the way. For those looking for a more sophisticated and versatile writing tablet that is less of a book replacement, the reMarkable Paper Pro is the superior device. And for people who don’t mind the notifications, apps and alerts that these purpose-driven tablets keep from distracting you, there’s always the option of buying an iPad or an Android tablet with a stylus. Just install minimal apps or block all notifications, and you might even save hundreds of dollars in the process. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Wrap-up I hate to admit it, but Amazon’s devices and services chief Panos Panay was right in calling the Kindle Scribe a 2-in-1. But the two functions it serves are very specific. I think of the Scribe devices as Kindles first and foremost. That means they’re ereaders, capable of substituting stacks of books thanks to their digital libraries and eye-friendly screens. The second role the Scribe plays well is that of a notebook substitute. It is a place to hold endless slips of digital paper, and its search function can competently help you find what you jotted down in a random note years ago. But Amazon has not yet found a way to deliver on features like annotating and marking up ebooks that feels like pen-and-paper. Trying to mark up a digital textbook on the Scribe still feels unintuitive, involving virtual sticky notes, collapsible margins and inserting boxes within lines of text. And you won’t be able to easily edit your notes if you’re away from your Scribe, unlike how you can on a reMarkable product. So the Kindle Scribe 3 is not a three- or four-in-one. I don’t have a problem with that, especially without the extra cost that comes with the color capabilities. While the Colorsoft model is superior to the competition at the moment, it also comes at a premium. If you’re looking for the best color E Ink writing tablet available and are willing to splurge, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is worth consideration.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-scribe-colorsoft-review-a-very-particular-set-of-skills-for-a-price-140014961.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A Los Angeles-based startup has demonstrated what it calls a breakthrough in hardware development: an artificial intelligence system that designed a fully functional Linux computer in one week — a process that would typically consume nearly three months of skilled engineering labor.Quilter, which has raised more than $40 million from investors including Benchmark, Index Ventures, and Coatue, used its physics-driven AI to automate the design of a two-board computer system that booted successfully on its first attempt, requiring no costly revisions. The project, internally dubbed \"Project Speedrun,\" required just 38.5 hours of human labor compared to the 428 hours that professional PCB designers quoted for the same task.The announcement also marks the first public disclosure that Tony Fadell, the engineer who led development of the iPod and iPhone at Apple and later founded Nest, has invested in the company and serves as an advisor.\"We didn&#x27;t teach Quilter to draw; we taught it to think in physics,\" said Sergiy Nesterenko, Quilter&#x27;s chief executive and a former SpaceX engineer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"The result wasn&#x27;t a simulation — it was a working computer.\"Circuit board design remains the forgotten bottleneck that delays nearly every hardware productThe announcement shines a light on an unglamorous but critical chokepoint in technology development: printed circuit board layout. While semiconductors and software have received enormous attention and investment, the green fiberglass boards that connect chips, memory, and components in virtually every electronic device remain stubbornly manual to design.\"Besides auto-routers, the technology really hadn&#x27;t changed since the early &#x27;90s,\" Fadell told VentureBeat. \"The best boards are still made by hand. You go to Apple, they&#x27;ve got the tools, and these guys are just pushing traces, checking everything, doing flood fills—and you&#x27;re like, there&#x27;s got to be a better way.\"The PCB design process typically unfolds in three stages. Engineers first create a schematic — a logical diagram showing how components connect. Then a specialist manually draws the physical layout in CAD software, placing components and routing thousands of copper traces across multiple layers. Finally, the design goes to a manufacturer for fabrication.That middle step — the layout — creates a persistent bottleneck. For a board of moderate complexity, the process typically consumes four to eight weeks. For sophisticated systems like computers or automotive electronics, timelines stretch to three months or longer.\"The timeline was always this elastic thing—they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s two weeks minimum,&#x27;\" Fadell recalled of his experience at Apple and Nest. \"And we&#x27;d say, &#x27;No, no. Work day and night. It&#x27;s two weeks.&#x27; But it was always this fixed bottleneck.\"The consequences ripple through hardware organizations. Firmware teams sit idle waiting for physical boards to test their code. Validation engineers cannot begin debugging. Product launches slip. According to Quilter&#x27;s research, only about 10 percent of first board revisions work correctly, forcing expensive and time-consuming respins.Project Speedrun put Quilter&#x27;s AI to the test with an 843-component computer that booted on the first tryProject Speedrun was designed to push the technology to its limits while producing an easily understood result: a working computer that could boot Linux, browse the internet, and run applications.The system consists of two boards based on NXP&#x27;s i.MX 8M Mini reference platform, a processor architecture used in automotive infotainment, industrial automation, and machine vision applications.The main system-on-module contains a quad-core ARM processor running at 1.8 gigahertz, 2 gigabytes of LPDDR4 memory, and 32 gigabytes of eMMC storage. A companion baseboard provides connectivity including Ethernet, USB, HDMI, and audio.Together, the boards incorporate 843 components and 5,141 electrical connections, or \"pins,\" routed across eight-layer circuit board stackups manufactured by Sierra Circuits in California. The minimum trace geometry reached 2 mils (two-thousandths of an inch) on the system-on-module — fine enough to require advanced high-density interconnect manufacturing techniques.Quilter&#x27;s AI completed the layout with approximately 98 percent routing coverage and zero design rule violations. Both boards passed power-on testing and successfully booted Debian Linux on the first attempt.\"We made an entire computer to demonstrate that this technology works,\" Nesterenko said. \"We took something that&#x27;s typically quoted at 400 to 450 hours, automated the vast majority of it, and reduced it to about 30 to 40 hours of cleanup time.\"The cleanup time is work that human engineers still perform: reviewing the AI&#x27;s output, fixing any issues, and preparing final fabrication files. But even with that overhead, the total elapsed time from schematic to fabricated boards collapsed from the typical 11 weeks to a single week.Unlike ChatGPT, Quilter&#x27;s AI learns by playing billions of games against the laws of physicsQuilter&#x27;s technical approach differs fundamentally from the large language models that have dominated recent AI headlines. Where systems like GPT-5 or Claude learn to predict text based on massive training datasets of human writing, Quilter&#x27;s AI learns by playing what amounts to an elaborate game against the laws of physics.\"Language models don&#x27;t apply to us because this is not a language problem,\" Nesterenko explained. \"If you ask it to actually create a blueprint, it has no training data for that. It has no context for that.\"The company also rejected the seemingly obvious approach of training on examples of human-designed boards. Nesterenko cited three reasons: humans make frequent errors (explaining why most boards require revisions), the best designs are locked inside large companies unwilling to share proprietary data, and training on human examples would cap the AI&#x27;s performance at human levels.Instead, Quilter built what Nesterenko describes as a \"game\" where the AI agent makes sequential decisions — place this component here, route this trace there — and receives feedback based on whether the resulting design satisfies electromagnetic, thermal, and manufacturing constraints.\"What you&#x27;re really changing is not the probability of getting a very specific outcome of the model, but the probability of choosing a certain action based on that experience,\" Nesterenko said.The approach mirrors DeepMind&#x27;s progression with its Go-playing systems. The original AlphaGo learned from human games, but its successor AlphaZero learned purely through self-play and ultimately surpassed human capability. Quilter harbors similar ambitions.\"In the long term, to come up with better designs for circuit boards than humans have ever tried to do,\" Nesterenko said.Fadell drew a parallel to an earlier technological transition: \"I remember this with assembly. You had assembly and compilers, and engineers would say, &#x27;I can&#x27;t trust the compiler. I&#x27;m going to do the loop unrolling myself.&#x27; Now very, very few people write any assembly.\"He expects PCB design to follow a similar arc: \"I hope the same thing happens with PCB design. Sure, a few people will hold out, but these tools are going to get so good that everyone else will move on.\"Fadell and Nesterenko spent months solving a delicate problem: how to automate design without stripping engineers of controlAutomating a task that skilled professionals have performed manually for decades raises an obvious question: how do engineers maintain control over designs that will ultimately ship in products where reliability matters?Fadell said he spent significant time with Nesterenko working through this tension. The solution, he said, lies in allowing users to choose their level of involvement at each stage of the process.\"If you&#x27;re a control freak, you can be a control freak. If you want to say &#x27;just do it for me,&#x27; you can do that too—and everything in between,\" Fadell said. \"You can walk through each phase of the design and get involved wherever you want, or let the AI handle it.\"The workflow breaks into three phases: setup, where engineers define constraints and requirements; execution, where the AI generates candidate layouts; and cleanup, where humans review and refine the output. Engineers can intervene at any point, adjusting constraints and regenerating designs until they&#x27;re satisfied.\"This is something Tony and I talk about a lot,\" Nesterenko said. \"How do we give users control while still automating most of the work?\"Quilter&#x27;s technology has clear boundaries: 10,000 pins and 10 gigahertz mark the current limitsThe technology has clear limitations. Quilter currently handles boards with up to roughly 10,000 pins — sufficient for a wide range of applications but well short of the most complex designs, which can exceed 100,000 connections.Physics complexity also creates boundaries. The system handles high-speed communications up to approximately 10 gigahertz, covering typical consumer electronics and many industrial applications. But advanced systems like sophisticated radar, which can operate at 100 gigahertz, exceed current capabilities.\"There are boards where Quilter won&#x27;t make enough progress to make the cleanup time worthwhile,\" Nesterenko acknowledged. \"We&#x27;re just not that helpful yet with the most advanced, sophisticated designs.\"The company has focused initially on categories where speed matters more than extreme complexity: test fixtures, evaluation boards, design validation boards, and environmental test hardware. These boards often sit in long queues behind higher-priority production designs, delaying engineering programs.The company bets that engineers will pay the same price for a 10x speed improvementQuilter prices its service by pin count, matching the billing conventions that already exist when companies hire outside layout specialists. The pitch to customers is cost neutrality with a ten-fold improvement in speed.\"We&#x27;re going to charge you roughly the same that you would pay for the pins that you would with a person,\" Nesterenko said. \"But the reason you choose us is that we do this 10 times faster.\"For a company waiting three months for a board layout, receiving it in a week fundamentally changes what&#x27;s possible. Engineering teams can run multiple design experiments in parallel. Firmware developers get hardware faster. Products reach the market sooner.The company offers free access for hobbyists, students, and small businesses with less than $50,000 in revenue — a strategy to build familiarity while targeting enterprise customers for commercial revenue.The iPod creator waited years to attach his name to Quilter — until he could prove the technology actually worksFadell said he chose this moment to publicly acknowledge his investment because the Project Speedrun demonstration provides concrete evidence that the technology works.\"It&#x27;s not about being comfortable—I was always comfortable with the team,\" he said. \"This was about waiting until we had something you could hang your hat on. Now I can say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve used the tool. I&#x27;ve seen it.&#x27;\"He contrasted his approach with typical investor announcements: \"Every investor goes, I invested in this, it&#x27;s gonna change the world. It&#x27;s like, no, I know better. I&#x27;ve used the tool. I know people who use it. I asked my startups to use the tool.\"Fadell&#x27;s involvement goes beyond capital. He described email exchanges running to \"a dozen pages of details\" covering product design, user experience, enterprise sales, and technical architecture.\"Of all the investors I work with, Tony by far goes deepest with me on the product side,\" Nesterenko said.If Quilter succeeds, it could unlock a new generation of hardware startups that were never economically viable beforeThe stakes extend far beyond one company&#x27;s product roadmap. If Quilter&#x27;s technology scales, it could fundamentally alter the economics of building physical products.Fadell argued that hardware development has historically moved slowly because each step in the process — schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, assembly — created friction. Other innovations have already smoothed schematic tools and manufacturing. Layout remained the stubborn holdout.\"Once you shrink that from weeks to hours, you can iterate so much faster because all the other friction in the chain has been reduced,\" Fadell said.He predicted the technology would eventually extend upstream into schematic design itself, with AI that understands both logical connections and physical constraints helping engineers avoid problems earlier in the process.At MIT, where Fadell now spends time, he encounters would-be founders who have abandoned hardware ambitions because the process seemed insurmountable.\"I talk to professors and startup founders, and they say, &#x27;I&#x27;m never doing hardware. It&#x27;s too hard,&#x27;\" he said. \"I hope we can make it easier for more people to jump in and try things.\"Industry veterans remain skeptical. Auto-routing tools — previous attempts at automation — became notorious for producing unusable results, spawning T-shirts proclaiming engineers would \"never trust the auto-router.\"Nesterenko has seen the skepticism dissolve in real time. He described a recent meeting with executives from a major customer who came to discuss Quilter&#x27;s capabilities. As the conversation unfolded, one executive picked up the Project Speedrun boards and began photographing them from every angle, turning them over in his hands.\"He was just fascinated by the fact that this is possible now,\" Nesterenko said.The question is no longer whether AI can design circuit boards. A working Linux computer, assembled from 843 components and booted on the first attempt, answers that definitively. The question now is what engineers will build when layout stops being the bottleneck — when hardware, as Fadell put it, finally \"moves at the speed of thought.\"On that point, Nesterenko offered a prediction. \"If you ask the average electrical engineer today whether automation or AI could at all help with the board of this complexity, they would say no,\" he said. For decades, they would have been right. As of last week, they&#x27;re not.",

It&#x27;s like, no, I know better. I&#x27;ve used the tool. I know people who use it. I asked my startups to use the tool.\"Fadell&#x27;s involvement goes beyond capital. He described email exchanges running to \"a dozen pages of details\" covering product design, user experience, enterprise sales, and technical architecture.\"Of all the investors I work with, Tony by far goes deepest with me on the product side,\" Nesterenko said.If Quilter succeeds, it could unlock a new generation of hardware startups that were never economically viable beforeThe stakes extend far beyond one company&#x27;s product roadmap. If Quilter&#x27;s technology scales, it could fundamentally alter the economics of building physical products.Fadell argued that hardware development has historically moved slowly because each step in the process — schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, assembly — created friction. Other innovations have already smoothed schematic tools and manufacturing. Layout remained the stubborn holdout.\"Once you shrink that from weeks to hours, you can iterate so much faster because all the other friction in the chain has been reduced,\" Fadell said.He predicted the technology would eventually extend upstream into schematic design itself, with AI that understands both logical connections and physical constraints helping engineers avoid problems earlier in the process.At MIT, where Fadell now spends time, he encounters would-be founders who have abandoned hardware ambitions because the process seemed insurmountable.\"I talk to professors and startup founders, and they say, &#x27;I&#x27;m never doing hardware. It&#x27;s too hard,&#x27;\" he said. \"I hope we can make it easier for more people to jump in and try things.\"Industry veterans remain skeptical. Auto-routing tools — previous attempts at automation — became notorious for producing unusable results, spawning T-shirts proclaiming engineers would \"never trust the auto-router.\"Nesterenko has seen the skepticism dissolve in real time. He described a recent meeting with executives from a major customer who came to discuss Quilter&#x27;s capabilities. As the conversation unfolded, one executive picked up the Project Speedrun boards and began photographing them from every angle, turning them over in his hands.\"He was just fascinated by the fact that this is possible now,\" Nesterenko said.The question is no longer whether AI can design circuit boards. A working Linux computer, assembled from 843 components and booted on the first attempt, answers that definitively. The question now is what engineers will build when layout stops being the bottleneck — when hardware, as Fadell put it, finally \"moves at the speed of thought.\"On that point, Nesterenko offered a prediction. \"If you ask the average electrical engineer today whether automation or AI could at all help with the board of this complexity, they would say no,\" he said. For decades, they would have been right. As of last week, they&#x27;re not.",

At the time, the company said more software was on the way, and now one of the most popular professional applications is available through the chatbot. Starting today, you can access Photoshop, Acrobat and Adobe Express inside of ChatGPT. All the apps are free to use through OpenAI’s website, though before you can begin generating PDFs and illustrations using Acrobat and Adobe Express, you'll need to sign into your Adobe account. To use any of the apps in ChatGPT, either name them in your prompt or select them from the plus menu. Of the three apps, the way OpenAI's chatbot connects to Photoshop is probably the most interesting. Depending on the prompt, the interface will change to display the sliders most relevant to your request. For example, if you want to brighten an image, you'll see one slider allowing you to adjust the exposure, alongside other ones for the shadows and highlights. By comparison, if you want to add an effect to an image, ChatGPT might display options related to dithering and tri-tone, among others. What's interesting about all this is the way ChatGPT is interacting with Adobe's tools, through an MCP server, to offer a slice of the company's apps. I don't know about you, but I’ve always found Adobe software to be far too complicated, with often one too many ways to accomplish the same task. Granted, what I saw was a hands-off demo, but the routing Adobe created worked well. A ChatGPT user asks the chatbot to create a dance party invitation.

That's the nature of it being non-deterministic, and we're continuing to hone as much as we can from users' intent and natural language to give them the result that they're looking for.\"Of course, if you ever want more control, the web versions of Photoshop, Acrobat and Adobe Express are a click away. For OpenAI, this is easily the biggest coup to date of its push to reshape ChatGPT into an operating system for all the apps its more than 800 million users depend on daily. For Adobe, it feels like the company is partnering with an entity out to eat its lunch. After all, OpenAI offers its own image generation. However, Cattell said Adobe doesn't see it that way. \"A couple weeks back, OpenAI dropped Apps SDK as a new paradigm for accessing ChatGPT, we saw there was a natural fit in the work we were doing with our applications,\" he said. \"Essentially, they gave us an operating system we were able to leverage to bring our applications to their surface.

          "standfirst": "Spotty Wi-Fi can make even simple tasks feel harder than they should. If you’ve ever had a video call freeze in one room or watched a stream buffer in another, a mesh Wi-Fi system can fix those frustrations. Instead of relying on a single router tucked in a corner, a mesh setup uses multiple units that work together to spread a strong, consistent signal throughout your home.Modern mesh systems are built for busy households. They keep dozens of devices connected at once, manage traffic intelligently and often include helpful app features that make troubleshooting or adjusting settings much easier. Many support the latest Wi-Fi standards and faster internet plans too, so you can upgrade your network without replacing everything else.We’ve tested a range of mesh Wi-Fi systems to find the ones that deliver the best mix of speed, coverage and reliability. Whether you live in a small apartment or a multi-floor home, these picks can help you stay connected wherever you are. Table of contents Best mesh Wi-Fi systems for 2025 What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested How we test Wi-Fi routers Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs Best mesh Wi-Fi systems for 2025 What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system Linksys’ CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an “advancement in Wi-Fi technology” over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn’t ideal. “You can have a small [home], but there’s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,” he said. Historically, the solution to a home’s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a Wi-Fi extender but Bettino said the hardware has both a “terrible user experience” and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers “multiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,” says Bettino, resulting in “ubiquitous Wi-Fi” that feels as if you have a “router in every room.” Rather than having one main router in your home, having a “router in every room” is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There’s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to. It’s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco's Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]” MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service. What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean? I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it. Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on. Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E? Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you. Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming. So, what am I looking for? Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs. What about Wi-Fi 7? We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer. Range and speed All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec. Backhaul Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Connectivity These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter. It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure. Flexibility and scalability Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle. It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh. Placement Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home. Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV. Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested Amazon Eero Pro 7 Eero built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year. Amazon Eero 6E Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering. Netgear Orbi 960 The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It's a fantastic piece of gear, but it's worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems. How we test Wi-Fi routers My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors. For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place. Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns. Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms. What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router? A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade. That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame. What's the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system? Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets. What is a wireless backhaul? As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system? This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer. It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi. But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors. If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds. But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill. When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss",

Matt MacPherson, Cisco's Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]” MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service. What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean? I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it. Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on. Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E? Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you. Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming. So, what am I looking for? Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs. What about Wi-Fi 7? We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer. Range and speed All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec. Backhaul Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Connectivity These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter. It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure. Flexibility and scalability Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle. It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh. Placement Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home. Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV. Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested Amazon Eero Pro 7 Eero built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year. Amazon Eero 6E Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering. Netgear Orbi 960 The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It's a fantastic piece of gear, but it's worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems. How we test Wi-Fi routers My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors. For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place. Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns. Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms. What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router? A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade. That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame. What's the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system? Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets. What is a wireless backhaul? As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system? This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer. It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi. But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors. If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds. But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill. When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss",

          "content": "Cast your mind back to 2021. Electric vehicles were hot stuff, buoyed by Tesla’s increasingly stratospheric valuation and a general optimism fueled by what would turn out to be the most significant climate-focused spending package in US history. For some time, automakers had been promising an all-electric future, and they started laying the groundwork to make that happen, partnering with battery suppliers and the like. Take Ford—that year, it announced a joint venture with SK to build a pair of battery factories, one in Kentucky, the other in Tennessee. BlueOvalSK represented an $11.4 billion investment that would create 11,000 jobs, we were told, and an annual output of 60 GWh from both plants. Four years later, things look very different. EV subsidies are dead, as is any inclination by the current government to hold automakers accountable for selling too many gas guzzlers. EV-heavy product plans have been thrown out, and designs for new combustion-powered cars are being dusted off and spiffed up. Fewer EVs means a need for fewer batteries, and today we saw that in evidence when it emerged that Ford and SK On are ending their battery factory joint venture.Read full article Comments",

The regular Scribe is also being joined by a lower-end Scribe with less storage and no front light and an upgraded Kindle Scribe Colorsoft model with a color e-ink screen. This makes it only the second Kindle to include a color screen, after last year’s Kindle Colorsoft. Both the regular Kindle Scribe and the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft are available to order starting today for $500 and $630, respectively. Both of those devices include a Premium Pen accessory and 32GB of internal storage; 64GB of storage is available for an extra $50 for both devices. The cheaper front light-less Scribe is coming sometime next year and will run $430 for a model with a more modest 16GB of storage. (These are all much more expensive than the original Scribe’s $340 launch price, but inflation, tariffs, and shortages are wreaking havoc with all kinds of tech prices for the past few years.) The Scribe and Scribe Colorsoft both come with an updated front light “with miniaturized LEDs that fit tightly against the display,” narrowing the bezel and improving the uniformity of the lighting. Amazon has also tweaked the friction level of the paper-like texture on the glass display, shrunk the gap between the glass and the actual display panel to make writing on the tablet feel more like writing on paper, and added a quad-core processor and more RAM to speed the tablet up.Read full article Comments",

The over 500 rounds fired were meant for its scientists and public health experts, who endured only to be sidelined, ignored, and overruled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist hellbent on warping the agency to fit his anti-science agenda. Then, on August 27, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez just weeks after she was confirmed by the Senate. She had refused to blindly approve vaccine recommendations from a panel of vaccine skeptics and contrarians that he had hand-selected. The agency descended into chaos, and Monarez wasn’t the only one to leave the agency that day. Three top leaders had reached their breaking point and coordinated their resignations upon the dramatic ouster: Drs. Demetre Daskalakis, Debra Houry, and Daniel Jernigan walked out of the agency as their colleagues rallied around them.Read full article Comments",

It’s the first major content licensing partnership between a Hollywood studio related to the most recent version of OpenAI’s AI video platform, which drew criticism from some parts of the entertainment industry when it launched in late September. “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Disney CEO Robert A. Iger in the announcement. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.” The deal creates interesting bedfellows between a company that basically defined modern US copyright policy through congressional lobbying back in the 1990s and one that has argued in a submission to the UK House of Lords that useful AI models cannot be created without copyrighted material.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A little while back, we took a look at a large cargo bike from Urban Arrow that had some interesting features: a drive train that sported continuous variable gearing and a belt drive. But it was difficult to get a feel for what using that drivetrain was like when it was being used to shift a large and extremely heavy cargo bike. So, I jumped at the opportunity when Urban Arrow’s sister company, Gazelle, offered a chance to ride one of its new Arroyo models, which feature the same drivetrain, but this time coupled to a fairly standard commuter bike. Getting rid of all the weight and bulk really allowed the drive system to shine. And, as with its cargo-carrying cousin, the bike is filled with thoughtful touches and design decisions that make riding it a pleasure. But all that comes at a cost: This is a premium bike with little in the way of compromises, and it’s priced accordingly. High-end hardware The Arroyo line is meant for commuters and urban/suburban riding. It has a step-through frame, a large rack, fenders, and its riding stance is very upright. In keeping with its Dutch heritage, it’s meant to be ridden as a bicycle, rather than a bike-like scooter. There’s no throttle to let you avoid pedaling, and even when it’s set to its maximum assist rating, you’ll end up putting in a reasonable amount of effort during the ride. If you’re looking for something that lets you handle a commute in hot weather without sweating, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Since the 1990s, physicists have pondered the tantalizing possibility of an exotic fourth type of neutrino, dubbed the “sterile” neutrino, that doesn’t interact with regular matter at all, apart from its fellow neutrinos, perhaps. But definitive experimental evidence for sterile neutrinos has remained elusive. Now it looks like the latest results from Fermilab’s MiniBooNE experiment have ruled out the sterile neutrino entirely, according to a paper published in the journal Nature. How did the possibility of sterile neutrinos even become a thing? It all dates back to the so-called “solar neutrino problem.” Physicists detected the first solar neutrinos from the Sun in 1966. The only problem was that there were far fewer solar neutrinos being detected than predicted by theory, a conundrum that became known as the solar neutrino problem. In 1962, physicists discovered a second type (“flavor”) of neutrino, the muon neutrino. This was followed by the discovery of a third flavor, the tau neutrino, in 2000. Physicists already suspected that neutrinos might be able to switch from one flavor to another. In 2002, scientists at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (or SNO) announced that they had solved the solar neutrino problem. The missing solar (electron) neutrinos were just in disguise, having changed into a different flavor on the long journey between the Sun and the Earth. If neutrinos oscillate, then they must have a teensy bit of mass after all. That posed another knotty neutrino-related problem. There are three neutrino flavors, but none of them has a well-defined mass. Rather, different kinds of “mass states” mix together in various ways to produce electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. That’s quantum weirdness for you.Read full article Comments",

The model achieves a 72.2 percent score on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark that attempts to test whether AI systems can solve real GitHub issues, putting it among the top-performing open-weights models. Perhaps more notably, Mistral didn’t just release an AI model, it released a new development app called Mistral Vibe. It’s a command line interface (CLI) similar to Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI that lets developers interact with the Devstral models directly in their terminal. The tool can scan file structures and Git status to maintain context across an entire project, make changes across multiple files, and execute shell commands autonomously. Mistral released the CLI under the Apache 2.0 license. It’s always wise to take AI benchmarks with a large grain of salt, but we’ve heard from employees of the big AI companies that they pay very close attention to how well models do on SWE-bench Verified, which presents AI models with 500 real software engineering problems pulled from GitHub issues in popular Python repositories. The AI must read the issue description, navigate the codebase, and generate a working patch that passes unit tests. While some AI researchers have noted that around 90 percent of the tasks in the benchmark test relatively simple bug fixes that experienced engineers could complete in under an hour, it’s one of the few standardized ways to compare coding models.Read full article Comments",

One area where the brand has never particularly excelled has been fuel efficiency, which is where today’s test car, the Subaru Forester Hybrid, comes in. The last time Ars reviewed a Subaru Forester, it left us impressed. How about one with 40 percent better economy, in that case? Now, the 2.5 L flat-four engine operates on the Atkinson/Miller cycle, which generates 162 hp (121 kW) and 154 lb-ft (208 Nm). There’s an electric motor-generator starter and an electric traction motor with 118 hp (88 kW) and 199 lb-ft (270 Nm) that work together to send a combined 194 hp (145 kW) to all four wheels via a symmetrical all-wheel drive system and a planetary continuously variable transmission. The Forester Hybrid is 183.3 inches (4,656 mm) long, 70.2 inches (1,783 mm) wide, and 68.1 inches (1,729 mm) tall, with a 105.1-inch (2,670 mm) wheelbase.

Upscaling technologies like Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), and Intel’s Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) are all ways to transform a lower-resolution source image into a higher-resolution image, delivering better-looking games without requiring as much graphics hardware as you’d need to render the higher-resolution image natively. Later additions have focused on improving ray-tracing performance and “frame generation” technologies that boost frame rates by creating new AI-generated frames to insert between natively rendered frames. Generally speaking, Nvidia’s DLSS technologies have provided better image quality than AMD’s FSR, but they have only been available on newer Nvidia hardware—the GeForce RTX 20-series or newer for most features, with frame-generation features locked to the RTX 40- and 50-series. FSR’s results don’t look as good, but they have benefited from running on just about anything, including older GPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and even integrated Intel and AMD GPUs. Today, AMD is trying to shift that dynamic with something called “FSR Redstone,” a collection of ray-tracing and frame-generation features all intended to boost AMD’s image quality while being relatively easy to implement for game developers who are already using FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.Read full article Comments",

Based on chemical analysis of the sediment at the site, along with the telltale presence of pyrite, a mineral not naturally found nearby but very handy for striking sparks with flint, British Museum archaeologist Rob Davis and his colleagues say the Neanderthals probably started the fire themselves. That makes the abandoned English clay pit at Barnham the oldest evidence in the world that people (Neanderthal people, in this case) had learned to not only use fire, but also create it and control it. A cozy Neanderthal campfire Today, the Barnham site is part of an abandoned clay pit where workers first discovered stone tools in the early 1900s. But 400,000 years ago, it would have been a picturesque little spot at the edge of a stream-fed pond, surrounded by a mix of forest and grassland. There are no hominin fossils here, but archaeologists unearthed a Neanderthal skull about 100 kilometers to the south, so the hominins at Barnham were probably also Neanderthals. The place would have offered a group of Neanderthals a relatively quiet, sheltered place to set up camp, according to Davis and his colleagues.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Donald Trump’s decision to allow Nvidia to export an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, to China may give China exactly what it needs to win the AI race, experts and lawmakers have warned. The H200 is about 10 times less powerful than Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, which is the tech giant’s currently most advanced chip that cannot be exported to China. But the H200 is six times more powerful than the H20, the most advanced chip available in China today. Meanwhile China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, is estimated to be about two years behind Nvidia’s technology. By approving the sales, Trump may unwittingly be helping Chinese chip makers “catch up” to Nvidia, Jake Sullivan told The New York Times. Sullivan, a former Biden-era national security advisor who helped design AI chip export curbs on China, told the NYT that Trump’s move was “nuts” because “China’s main problem” in the AI race “is they don’t have enough advanced computing capability.”Read full article Comments",

The man—Donor 7069, alias “Kjeld”—carries a rare mutation in the TP53 gene, which codes for a critical tumor suppressor called protein 53 or p53. This protein (which is a transcription factor) keeps cells from dividing uncontrollably, can activate DNA repair processes amid damage, and can trigger cell death when a cell is beyond repair. Many cancers are linked to mutations in p53.Read full article Comments",
