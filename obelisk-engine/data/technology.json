          "content": "The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is on sale for $999.99, its lowest price to date. From Apple devices to chargers, we’re already seeing a wave of discounts on some of our favorite gadgets ahead of Amazon’s October Prime Day event. And while there are plenty of great deals across the board, some of the biggest savings so far are on robot vacuums. Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra — our favorite robot vacuum overall — is down to its best price to date, for instance, while even budget-friendly picks like the Tapo RV30 Max Plus are receiving sizable discounts. There’s something to suit just about every need and budget, so let’s dig into the best early robovac deals you can shop before Amazon’s two-day shopping event kicks off on October 7th. Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop which is why it’s our top pick overall. It features Roborock’s best obstacle avoidance, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice. Where to Buy: $1799.99 $999.99 at Best Buy The Roborock Q8 Max Plus is on sale at Walmart in white for $379.99 ($440 off), which is its best price to date. The robovac / mop hybrid isn’t as powerful or feature-rich as the S8 MaxV Ultra, but it still delivers 5,500Pa of suction and 30 adjustable water-flow levels. While it lacks a built-in camera for advanced object recognition, its built-in lidar navigation does a reliable job of steering clear of most obstacles. Roborock’s Saros Z70 is available for $1,999.99 from Amazon, Roborock, and Best Buy, which isn’t as low as its previous sale price of $1,599 but still a solid $400 discount. The Matter-compatible robot vacuum features a built-in robotic arm that can pick up small items, such as socks or tissues, although it isn’t always perfect. It’s also capable of climbing over thick carpets and offers great vacuuming prowess, with 22,000Pa of suction power and spinning mop pads that automatically detach when not in use. It even works with Roborock’s Multifunctional Dock 4.0, which allows it to automatically empty, charge, refill, and drain its own water tanks with minimal effort on your part. Read our review. Dreame L20 Ultra The high-end Dreame L20 Ultra is the least hands-on vacuum / mop you can buy. It can remove and reattach its oscillating mopping pads, wash and dry them, refill its water tank, and empty the bin. It can also do the splits with its mops to clean your baseboards better. The newer X30 Ultra has some improvements, but on balance, the L20 is still the best value. Where to Buy: $999.99 $449.99 at Dreame $999.99 $499.98 at Amazon The Dreame X40 Ultra is on sale for $699.99 ($500 off) directly from Dreame with code X40UFPD, which is one of its better prices to date. The robovac / mop hybrid delivers 12,000Pa of suction power and comes with an extendable side brush and self-cleaning mop pads, making it great for cleaning under furniture and tackling baseboards. What’s more, the X40 Ultra boasts a dirt-detection system capable of identifying and focusing on cleaning up particularly messy spills. The SwitchBot S10 is available from SwitchBot for $459.99 when you use coupon code OPOP700, down from $1,199.99 and approximately $60 shy of its all-time low. The budget-friendly robot vacuum and mop hybrid offers a lot of convenience for the price, with self-cleaning rolling mops that can dry themselves, a self-emptying bin, and up to 6,500Pa of suction power. The Matter-compatible vac can also run for as long as 90 days and offers decent AI-powered obstacle avoidance; however, in our experience, it can still get tripped up by laundry and other objects on the floor. Read our review. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop The Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop mops very well — doing a swinging, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” However, you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops, as it only self-empties in vacuum mode and can only avoid larger objects. Where to Buy: $699.99 $349.99 at Amazon $699.99 $349.99 at Best Buy $699.99 $399.99 at Shark The SwitchBot K10 Plus is on sale for $179.99 ($220 off) at SwitchBot’s online storefront (with promo code OPOP200), which is one of its better prices to date. The robovac offers just 2,500Pa of suction, but its small size makes it well-suited for cleaning tighter spaces, and it’s still powerful enough to effectively dig dirt out of your average carpet. It also comes with a self-emptying dock and disposable mopping pads, which aren’t the best, but they’re a handy perk if mopping isn’t a priority. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our favorite midrange robovac / mop, is down to $587 ($313 off) at Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon, which is one of its best prices to date. The X10 Pro Omni delivers 8,000Pa of suction power, and it’s especially great for cleaning up carpets and tiles. It also features reliable AI-powered obstacle detection, dual oscillating brushes for mopping up floors, and a dock that handles auto-emptying, washing, and refilling. Deebot X8 Pro Omni The Deebot X8 Pro Omni remains our favorite robot vacuum / mop. It represents a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line, with great obstacle avoidance, a small dock, and a convenient self-cleaning brush system. Where to Buy: $1399.99 $799.99 at Amazon $1399.99 $839.99 at Evovacs iRobot’s Roomba Combo 10 Max is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $599 ($800 off). It’s our favorite Roomba for pet owners, thanks to its exceptionally powerful suction, dual rubber roller brushes, and self-cleaning mop. Its AI-powered obstacle detection can even distinguish between a pile of popcorn and pet waste, ensuring it steers clear of the latter. Narwal’s Freo Z Ultra is on sale for $949.99 — down from $1,499.99 — at Costco, which is one of its better prices to date. The self-drying robovac / mop hybrid offers 12,000Pa of suction, and it leverages dual cameras and AI chips to continuously scan its surroundings. It then responds in real time, allowing it to maneuver around pet waste, switch to mop-only mode when it detects a spill, and carry out a host of other scenario-based actions. You can grab the Eufy Omni S1 Pro from Eufy for $649.99 ($650 off) when you use promo code WS24T2071111 at checkout. The robovac’s 11.4-inch roller mop and dual spinning side brushes do an excellent job of leaving hardwood floors spotless, and it can even wash and dry itself. Plus, with 8,000Pa of suction power, it’s a decent at picking up dirt and debris from carpets; it also features solid AI-powered obstacle avoidance, so you don’t need to worry about it getting stuck in clutter. Tapo RV30 Max Plus Our favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock. Where to Buy: $329.99 $279.99 at Amazon $329.99 $229.99 at TP-Link (code applied at checkout) Eufy’s discontinued 11S Max is still available at Amazon and Walmart for just $149.99 ($130 off), nearly matching its best price to date. The quiet robovac doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi, so you’ll need to control it using the onboard button or the included remote. It lacks higher-end features like self-emptying bins and AI obstacle avoidance, too, but with a decent 2,000Pa of suction power and easily replaceable parts, it’s a solid investment for those working with a relatively tight budget. Speaking of bump-and-roll bots, you can snag the Shark Ion at Amazon for $139.99 ($110 off), which is just $20 shy of its all-time low. It’s a no-frills robot vacuum that’s easy to operate, but still cleans surprisingly well thanks to a hybrid bristle-and-plastic roller brush that resists tangles and a set of big wheels that make crossing floor transitions easy. iRobot Roomba Combo i5 Although it has been discontinued, the Roomba Combo i5 Plus remains a solid budget robovac / mop hybrid with room mapping features and wide, dual rubber brushes that are great for picking up dirt and debris. Where to Buy: $549.99 $299 at Walmart (with self-emptying dock)",

OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls \"cameos.\" OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden. Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The UK government is reportedly once again demanding that Apple provide it with backdoor access to encrypted iCloud user data, following claims that the effort had been abandoned in August. The Financial Times reports that a new technical capability notice (TCN) was issued by the UK Home Office in early September, this time specifically targeting access to British citizens’ iCloud backups. This follows the UK issuing a broader secret order in January, demanding that Apple create a backdoor for security officials to access global encrypted user files. While it’s a criminal offense to reveal the existence of these secret TCN orders, Apple responded by filing an appeal and removing a feature, Advanced Data Protection, its end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, from the UK. After facing pressure from the US regarding potential violations of the Cloud Act, it was announced by US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Britain had rescinded the order. “The UK has agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a ‘back door’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,” Gabbard posted to X on August 19th. While US officials raised concerns about the order during President Trump’s state visit to the UK last month, according to The Financial Times, the publication reports that two senior British government figures said the UK was no longer facing US pressure to drop its demands. We have reached out to Apple for comment. The UK Home Office declined to comment on the situation. The UK’s revived attempt to bypass Apple’s data encryption has sparked concerns that security and privacy may still be impacted for users worldwide. “If Apple breaks end-to-end encryption for the UK, it breaks it for everyone,” said Privacy International, a non-profit privacy watchdog. “The resulting vulnerability can be exploited by hostile states, criminals and other bad actors the world over.”",

An unsophisticated, yet effective, delivery vector Security company Sekoia on Tuesday said that an analysis of “suspicious network traces” detected in its honeypots led to the discovery of a cellular router being abused to send SMS messages with phishing URLs. As company researchers investigated further, they identified more than 18,000 such routers accessible on the Internet, with at least 572 of them allowing free access to programming interfaces to anyone who took the time to look for them. The vast majority of the routers were running firmware versions that were more than three years out of date and had known vulnerabilities.Read full article Comments",

Their results suggest that extinct megafauna like giant sloths, giant armadillos, and elephant-like creatures were on the menu for Pleistocene hunters in South America. And that means human hunters may have played a nontrivial role in killing off the continent’s last great Ice Age megafauna. Giant ground sloth: It’s what’s for dinner Archaeologist Luciano Prates of Mexico's National University of La Plata and his colleagues counted the animal bones left behind by ancient people at 20 archaeological sites in modern-day Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. They compared the number of bones from extinct megafauna (technically, “megafauna” describes any animal over 44 kilograms) to the number of bones from smaller prey. They also tallied the remains of still-living species of megafauna like vicuñas. The archaeologists hoped to learn whether giant sloths, giant armadillos, and now-extinct species of horses were staples in the diets of Ice Age South Americans.Read full article Comments",

That kind of learning could underpin a robust version of a so-called \"world model\" that would represent a major breakthrough in generative AI's actual operant real-world capabilities. Recently, Google's DeepMind Research tried to add some scientific rigor to how well video models can actually learn about the real world from their training data. In the bluntly titled paper \"Video Models are Zero-shot Learners and Reasoners,\" the researchers used Google's Veo 3 model to generate thousands of videos designed to test its abilities across dozens of tasks related to perceiving, modeling, manipulating, and reasoning about the real world. In the paper, the researchers boldly claim that Veo 3 \"can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for\" (that's the \"zero-shot\" part of the title) and that video models \"are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.\" But digging into the actual results of those experiments, the researchers seem to be grading today's video models on a bit of a curve and assuming future progress will smooth out many of today's highly inconsistent results.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Netflix has released the full official trailer for director Guillermo del Toro's hotly anticipated new film Frankenstein, starring Oscar Isaac as the brilliant but tragically flawed mad scientist, Victor Frankenstein. Del Toro has been telling interviewers for years about his enduring love for Mary Shelley's novel and his long-standing desire to direct a film that would capture the novel's sense of grand Miltonian tragedy. He loved the original script for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 adaptation, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but the final film, alas, deviated sharply from that script and was just not that good. After several false starts, del Toro finally signed on to film his vision for Netflix in 2023. He called this film “the culmination of a journey that has occupied most of my life,” at the Netflix Tudum event earlier this year, adding, “Monsters have become my personal belief system. There are strands of Frankenstein through my films.” \"It was a religion for me,\" del Toro said during a press conference at the film's world premiere in Venice last month. \"Since I was a kid—I was raised very Catholic—I never quite understood the saints. And then when I saw Boris Karloff on the screen, I understood what a saint or a messiah looked like. So I've been following the creature since I was a kid, and I always waited for the movie to be done in the right conditions, both creatively in terms of achieving the scope that it needed for me to make it different, to make it at a scale that you could reconstruct the whole world.\"Read full article Comments",

Trump has maintained since taking office that reshoring of semiconductor supply chains is critical for economic and national security, and Lutnick indicated that Taiwan should agree to the unusual terms because it needs the US for protection. But speaking Wednesday, Cheng said that while \"certain progress\" has been made in trade talks, Taiwan has not only made \"no such commitment\" but that \"this issue was not discussed in this round of negotiation, and we will not agree to such a condition,\" Bloomberg reported.Read full article Comments",

The new app apparently boosts speed and reliability considerably, with camera feeds loading 70 percent faster and with 80 percent fewer app crashes.

It's still not for everyone, and in some ways, it has fallen behind the times since 2018. Nevertheless, the success of the streaming TV show based on the game franchise has attracted new players and given the developers a chance to seize the moment and attempt to complete a partial redemption story. To help make that happen, the game's developers will soon release an expansion fully capitalizing on that TV series for the first time, and I got to spend a few hours playing that update to see if it's any fun.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Without explanation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the Trump administration has reverted from using the disease name \"mpox\" to the obsolete \"monkeypox,\" which the world abandoned in 2022 because it was seen as racist and stigmatizing. Mpox is the name of the disease caused by Orthopoxvirus monkeypox, a relative of smallpox and cowpox that has exploded to global prominence in recent years. In 2022 and 2024, the spread of mpox caused the World Health Organization to declare international public health emergencies. Amid the attention, health officials became acutely aware of the problematic name.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Many of the most interesting bodies in our Solar System aren't planets, but the moons that orbit them. They have active volcanoes, hydrocarbon oceans, geysers, and moon-wide oceans buried under icy crusts. And, as far as we can tell, the physics of the processes that produce large planets should make moon formation inevitable. Given how common planets are, our galaxy should be teeming with moons. Yet, despite some tantalizing hints, we've not found a clear indication of a moon orbiting an exoplanet. What we have found are a few very young exoplanets that appear to have moon-forming disks around them. Now, the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a spectrum of the ring-forming disk around a giant super-Jupiter and found that it's rich in small carbon-based molecules. That's despite the fact that the star it's orbiting seems to have a planet-forming disk that's mostly water. Finding disks We search for exo-moons and moon-forming disks using completely different methods. To spot an actual moon, we rely on its gravitational influence. At some points in its orbit, it will be towing its planet forward to speed up its orbit; at others, it will be holding its planet back. This introduces subtle variations in the timing of when the planet arrives in front of the star from Earth's perspective.Read full article Comments",
