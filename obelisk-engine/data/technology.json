          "title": "Moving past speculation: How deterministic CPUs deliver predictable AI performance",
          "standfirst": "For more than three decades, modern CPUs have relied on speculative execution to keep pipelines full. When it emerged in the 1990s, speculation was hailed as a breakthrough — just as pipelining and superscalar execution had been in earlier decades. Each marked a generational leap in microarchitecture. By predicting the outcomes of branches and memory loads, processors could avoid stalls and keep execution units busy. But this architectural shift came at a cost: Wasted energy when predictions failed, increased complexity and vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown. These challenges set the stage for an alternative: A deterministic, time-based execution model. As David Patterson observed in 1980, “A RISC potentially gains in speed merely from a simpler design.” Patterson’s principle of simplicity underpins a new alternative to speculation: A deterministic, time-based execution model.\"For the first time since speculative execution became the dominant paradigm, a fundamentally new approach has been invented. This breakthrough is embodied in a series of six recently issued U.S. patents, sailing through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Together, they introduce a radically different instruction execution model. Departing sharply from conventional speculative techniques, this novel deterministic framework replaces guesswork with a time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism. Each instruction is assigned a precise execution slot within the pipeline, resulting in a rigorously ordered and predictable flow of execution. This reimagined model redefines how modern processors can handle latency and concurrency with greater efficiency and reliability. A simple time counter is used to deterministically set the exact time of when instructions should be executed in the future. Each instruction is dispatched to an execution queue with a preset execution time based on resolving its data dependencies and availability of resources — read buses, execution units and the write bus to the register file. Each instruction remains queued until its scheduled execution slot arrives. This new deterministic approach may represent the first major architectural challenge to speculation since it became the standard.The architecture extends naturally into matrix computation, with a RISC-V instruction set proposal under community review. Configurable general matrix multiply (GEMM) units, ranging from 8×8 to 64×64, can operate using either register-based or direct-memory acceess (DMA)-fed operands. This flexibility supports a wide range of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Early analysis suggests scalability that rivals Google’s TPU cores, while maintaining significantly lower cost and power requirements. Rather than a direct comparison with general-purpose CPUs, the more accurate reference point is vector and matrix engines: Traditional CPUs still depend on speculation and branch prediction, whereas this design applies deterministic scheduling directly to GEMM and vector units. This efficiency stems not only from the configurable GEMM blocks but also from the time-based execution model, where instructions are decoded and assigned precise execution slots based on operand readiness and resource availability. Execution is never a random or heuristic choice among many candidates, but a predictable, pre-planned flow that keeps compute resources continuously busy. Planned matrix benchmarks will provide direct comparisons with TPU GEMM implementations, highlighting the ability to deliver datacenter-class performance without datacenter-class overhead.Critics may argue that static scheduling introduces latency into instruction execution. In reality, the latency already exists — waiting on data dependencies or memory fetches. Conventional CPUs attempt to hide it with speculation, but when predictions fail, the resulting pipeline flush introduces delay and wastes power. The time-counter approach acknowledges this latency and fills it deterministically with useful work, avoiding rollbacks. As the first patent notes, instructions retain out-of-order efficiency: “A microprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions enables execution based on predicted timing rather than speculative issue and recovery,\" with preset execution times but without the overhead of register renaming or speculative comparators.Why speculation stalledSpeculative execution boosts performance by predicting outcomes before they’re known — executing instructions ahead of time and discarding them if the guess was wrong. While this approach can accelerate workloads, it also introduces unpredictability and power inefficiency. Mispredictions inject “No Ops” into the pipeline, stalling progress and wasting energy on work that never completes. These issues are magnified in modern AI and machine learning (ML) workloads, where vector and matrix operations dominate and memory access patterns are irregular. Long fetches, non-cacheable loads and misaligned vectors frequently trigger pipeline flushes in speculative architectures.The result is performance cliffs that vary wildly across datasets and problem sizes, making consistent tuning nearly impossible. Worse still, speculative side effects have exposed vulnerabilities that led to high-profile security exploits. As data intensity grows and memory systems strain, speculation struggles to keep pace — undermining its original promise of seamless acceleration.Time-based execution and deterministic schedulingAt the core of this invention is a vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions. Rather than relying on speculation, instructions are issued only when data dependencies and latency windows are fully known. This eliminates guesswork and costly pipeline flushes while preserving the throughput advantages of out-of-order execution. Architectures built on this patented framework feature deep pipelines — typically spanning 12 stages — combined with wide front ends supporting up to 8-way decode and large reorder buffers exceeding 250 entriesAs illustrated in Figure 1, the architecture mirrors a conventional RISC-V processor at the top level, with instruction fetch and decode stages feeding into execution units. The innovation emerges in the integration of a time counter and register scoreboard, strategically positioned between fetch/decode and the vector execution units. Instead of relying on speculative comparators or register renaming, they utilize a Register Scoreboard and Time Resource Matrix (TRM) to deterministically schedule instructions based on operand readiness and resource availability. Figure 1: High-level block diagram of deterministic processor. A time counter and scoreboard sit between fetch/decode and vector execution units, ensuring instructions issue only when operands are ready.A typical program running on the deterministic processor begins much like it does on any conventional RISC-V system: Instructions are fetched from memory and decoded to determine whether they are scalar, vector, matrix or custom extensions. The difference emerges at the point of dispatch. Instead of issuing instructions speculatively, the processor employs a cycle-accurate time counter, working with a register scoreboard, to decide exactly when each instruction can be executed. This mechanism provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.In conjunction with a register scoreboard, the time-resource matrix associates instructions with execution cycles, allowing the processor to plan dispatch deterministically across available resources. The scoreboard tracks operand readiness and hazard information, enabling scheduling without register renaming or speculative comparators. By monitoring dependencies such as read-after-write (RAW) and write-after-read, it ensures hazards are resolved without costly pipeline flushes. As noted in the patent, “in a multi-threaded microprocessor, the time counter and scoreboard permit rescheduling around cache misses, branch flushes, and RAW hazards without speculative rollback.”Once operands are ready, the instruction is dispatched to the appropriate execution unit. Scalar operations use standard artithmetic logic units (ALUs), while vector and matrix instructions execute in wide execution units connected to a large vector register file. Because instructions launch only when conditions are safe, these units stay highly utilized without the wasted work or recovery cycles caused by mis-predicted speculation. The key enabler of this approach is a simple time counter that orchestrates execution according to data readiness and resource availability, ensuring instructions advance only when operands are ready and resources available. The same principle applies to memory operations: The interface predicts latency windows for loads and stores, allowing the processor to fill those slots with independent instructions and keep execution flowing.Programming model differencesFrom the programmer’s perspective, the flow remains familiar — RISC-V code compiles and executes in the usual way. The crucial difference lies in the execution contract: Rather than relying on dynamic speculation to hide latency, the processor guarantees predictable dispatch and completion times. This eliminates the performance cliffs and wasted energy of speculation while still providing the throughput benefits of out-of-order execution. This perspective underscores how deterministic execution preserves the familiar RISC-V programming model while eliminating the unpredictability and wasted effort of speculation. As John Hennessy put it: \"It’s stupid to do work in run time that you can do in compile time”— a remark reflecting the foundations of RISC and its forward-looking design philosophy.The RISC-V ISA provides opcodes for custom and extension instructions, including floating-point, DSP, and vector operations. The result is a processor that executes instructions deterministically while retaining the benefits of out-of-order performance. By eliminating speculation, the design simplifies hardware, reduces power consumption and avoids pipeline flushes. These efficiency gains grow even more significant in vector and matrix operations, where wide execution units require consistent utilization to reach peak performance. Vector extensions require wide register files and large execution units, which in speculative processors necessitate expensive register renaming to recover from branch mispredictions. In the deterministic design, vector instructions are executed only after commit, eliminating the need for renaming.Each instruction is scheduled against a cycle-accurate time counter: “The time counter provides a deterministic execution contract, ensuring instructions complete at predictable cycles and reducing wasted issue slots.” The vector register scoreboard resolves data dependency before issuing instructions to execution pipeline. Instructions are dispatched in a known order at the correct cycle, making execution both predictable and efficient.Vector execution units (integer and floating point) connect directly to a large vector register file. Because instructions are never flushed, there is no renaming overhead. The scoreboard ensures safe access, while the time counter aligns execution with memory readiness. A dedicated memory block predicts the return cycle of loads. Instead of stalling or speculating, the processor schedules independent instructions into latency slots, keeping execution units busy. “A vector coprocessor with a time counter for statically dispatching instructions ensures high utilization of wide execution units while avoiding misprediction penalties.”In today’s CPUs, compilers and programmers write code assuming the hardware will dynamically reorder instructions and speculatively execute branches. The hardware handles hazards with register renaming, branch prediction and recovery mechanisms. Programmers benefit from performance, but at the cost of unpredictability and power consumption.In the deterministic time-based architecture, instructions are dispatched only when the time counter indicates their operands will be ready. This means the compiler (or runtime system) doesn’t need to insert guard code for misprediction recovery. Instead, compiler scheduling becomes simpler, as instructions are guaranteed to issue at the correct cycle without rollbacks. For programmers, the ISA remains RISC-V compatible, but deterministic extensions reduce reliance on speculative safety nets.Application in AI and MLIn AI/ML kernels, vector loads and matrix operations often dominate runtime. On a speculative CPU, misaligned or non-cacheable loads can trigger stalls or flushes, starving wide vector and matrix units and wasting energy on discarded work. A deterministic design instead issues these operations with cycle-accurate timing, ensuring high utilization and steady throughput. For programmers, this means fewer performance cliffs and more predictable scaling across problem sizes. And because the patents extend the RISC-V ISA rather than replace it, deterministic processors remain fully compatible with the RVA23 profile and mainstream toolchains such as GCC, LLVM, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr.In practice, the deterministic model doesn’t change how code is written — it remains RISC-V assembly or high-level languages compiled to RISC-V instructions. What changes is the execution contract: Rather than relying on speculative guesswork, programmers can expect predictable latency behavior and higher efficiency without tuning code around microarchitectural quirks.The industry is at an inflection point. AI/ML workloads are dominated by vector and matrix math, where GPUs and TPUs excel — but only by consuming massive power and adding architectural complexity. In contrast, general-purpose CPUs, still tied to speculative execution models, lag behind.A deterministic processor delivers predictable performance across a wide range of workloads, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of task complexity. Eliminating speculative execution enhances energy efficiency and avoids unnecessary computational overhead. Furthermore, deterministic design scales naturally to vector and matrix operations, making it especially well-suited for AI workloads that rely on high-throughput parallelism. This new deterministic approach may represent the next such leap: The first major architectural challenge to speculation since speculation itself became the standard.Will deterministic CPUs replace speculation in mainstream computing? That remains to be seen. But with issued patents, proven novelty and growing pressure from AI workloads, the timing is right for a paradigm shift. Taken together, these advances signal deterministic execution as the next architectural leap — redefining performance and efficiency just as speculation once did.Speculation marked the last revolution in CPU design; determinism may well represent the next.Thang Tran is the founder and CTO of Simplex Micro.Read more from our guest writers.

          "standfirst": "Techtober may have come to an end, but our reviews team is still hard at work with this fall’s haul of new devices. Over the last two weeks, we’ve tested two new Apple products, a powerful gaming handheld, some seriously impressive headphones and Meta’s sporty smart glasses — and that’s just the start. Read on to catch up on all you might’ve missed, including our picks for the best of 2025. Apple MacBook Pro M5 (14-inch) When it comes to the new M5-powered MacBook Pro, the question isn’t whether it’s a capable machine or not. The real dilemma is whether to buy now or wait for even more muscle from the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. “If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip),” senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar explained. “But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.” Sennheiser HDB 630 Sennheiser uses a USB-C dongle to bridge the gap between wireless convenience and audiophile-grade sound quality with the HDB 630. The problem is they don’t really look like a set of high-end headphones and the $500 asking price is steep. “As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone,” I wrote. “If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.” Lenovo Legion Go 2 Sometimes it’s better to have a utility player instead of a specialist. According to senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford, that’s exactly what you get with Lenovo’s Legion Go 2. You encounter great performance from a device with a huge 8.8-inch OLED display, but the handheld is expensive and bulky. “Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show,” he said. “While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.” Apple iPad Pro M5 (13-inch) The M5 iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also entirely too expensive.

Engadget’s best of 2025 In case you missed it, we announced our best of 2025 earlier this week. We made our picks based solely on the highest review scores in a variety of categories, so there’s a range of devices that made the cut. Our editors also explained why each one was the best in its category, so this is a good opportunity to get reacquainted with this year’s crop of gadgets and services. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-an-apple-duo-sennheiser-hdb-630-lenovo-legion-go-2-and-more-120000983.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Techtober may have come to an end, but our reviews team is still hard at work with this fall’s haul of new devices. Over the last two weeks, we’ve tested two new Apple products, a powerful gaming handheld, some seriously impressive headphones and Meta’s sporty smart glasses — and that’s just the start. Read on to catch up on all you might’ve missed, including our picks for the best of 2025. Apple MacBook Pro M5 (14-inch) When it comes to the new M5-powered MacBook Pro, the question isn’t whether it’s a capable machine or not. The real dilemma is whether to buy now or wait for even more muscle from the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. “If you absolutely need a workhorse MacBook Pro today, you'll have to settle for the M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are still far faster than the base M5 chip),” senior reviews reporter Devindra Hardawar explained. “But for most creatives, the M5 MacBook Pro offers an impressive balance of power and portability.” Sennheiser HDB 630 Sennheiser uses a USB-C dongle to bridge the gap between wireless convenience and audiophile-grade sound quality with the HDB 630. The problem is they don’t really look like a set of high-end headphones and the $500 asking price is steep. “As good as the HDB 630 is sound-wise, I can also appreciate that these aren’t the best headphones for everyone,” I wrote. “If you crave the best sound quality that still offers the convenience of wireless headphones — and you’re okay with a few extra steps — the HDB 630 is a worthy investment. Just don’t leave home without that dongle.” Lenovo Legion Go 2 Sometimes it’s better to have a utility player instead of a specialist. According to senior reviews reporter Sam Rutherford, that’s exactly what you get with Lenovo’s Legion Go 2. You encounter great performance from a device with a huge 8.8-inch OLED display, but the handheld is expensive and bulky. “Just like an SUV that might go off-road once or twice a year, you might not use the Legion Go 2's full capabilities all the time, but when you do and everything comes together, you realize all that utility isn't just for show,” he said. “While the ROG Xbox Ally X is the better value, I appreciate how Lenovo's handheld was made to handle a variety of battle conditions.” Apple iPad Pro M5 (13-inch) The M5 iPad Pro is impressive, but it’s also entirely too expensive. While the new chip offers a sizable upgrade, the screen is excellent and fast charging has finally hit the iPad, this model also requires you to spend more on accessories. “Unless you are going to use it as your main computer — all day, every day — and know exactly what benefits you’ll get from the iPad over a more traditional laptop, you’re probably better off buying an iPad Air and saving yourself a lot of money,” deputy news editor Nathan Ingraham wrote.

          "title": "How to make your lock screen background holographic in iOS 26",
          "standfirst": "Apple continues to refine the look and feel of the iPhone with each major iOS release, and iOS 26 places more emphasis than ever on personalization. The one big change is the introduction of Spatial Scenes, a feature that allows you to create what Apple calls “holographic” lock screens. Instead of being a flat image, the wallpaper reacts to the way you move your device, giving it a sense of depth and motion that feels far more dynamic than a standard background. The effect is similar to the parallax wallpapers Apple experimented with years ago, but this time it is more refined, more responsive and built around machine learning that separates the subject from the background in a photo. This effect works exclusively on the lock screen, leaving the home screen static unless you choose to pair wallpapers. It integrates seamlessly with existing customization tools, including widgets, clock styles and color options, giving your lock screen a fresh appearance without limiting your control. What are Spatial Scenes in iOS 26? Spatial Scenes in iOS 26 provides a more immersive and interactive way to personalize the iPhone. Unlike static wallpapers, the holographic lock screen responds to movement, adding depth and visual interest. It gives users more control over their device’s appearance, while still preserving usability and readability. By selecting images with clear depth and following the step-by-step setup, anyone can create a lock screen that feels dynamic and engaging. Choosing the right photo The type of image you select is key to achieving a successful holographic lock screen. Photos with a clear subject in the foreground with sufficient separation from the background process more effectively. Portraits, pets, buildings and landscapes often yield the best results. Images with busy backgrounds, excessive filters or heavy editing can confuse the depth detection, producing a less convincing effect. It is also important to consider the placement of your subject. Avoid placing the main focus near the top of the photo, where it could overlap the clock or widgets, as this may interfere with the visual layering. If you store photos in iCloud with “Optimize iPhone Storage” enabled, download the full-resolution version first to ensure the effect works correctly. Choosing the right photo will save time and improve the overall holographic appearance. How to create a holographic lock screen To create a holographic lock screen, start by waking up your iPhone and holding your finger on the lock screen until the wallpaper gallery appears. Tap Customize on an existing wallpaper or select the plus button to add a new one. If you are adding a new wallpaper, choose Photos and browse your library to select an image that shows a clear depth of field and a distinct foreground subject. Once you’ve picked your photo, a preview screen appears with a small hexagon icon in the lower right corner. This icon activates the Spatial Scene effect. Tap it to allow iOS to process the image. The system creates a depth map, separating the subject from the background. If the icon does not appear, the photo may not be good for Spatial Scenes, so choosing another image is recommended. After processing, adjust the image using pinch and drag gestures to zoom or reposition the subject. Proper framing ensures the subject does not conflict with the clock or widgets. Once satisfied, tap Add or Done. You will then choose whether to apply the wallpaper as a pair, which sets it for both lock and home screens, or restrict it to the lock screen only. The holographic effect will appear whenever you view your lock screen. Optimizing the effect Spatial Scenes are supported on iPhone 12 models and newer, since the processing relies on more advanced chips. Low Power Mode may interfere with the motion effect, so disabling it can help if the wallpaper appears static. Accessibility settings like Reduce Motion also impact Spatial Scenes, so check these if the effect does not display. Restarting the device or selecting a different image often resolves any issues. Wide landscapes and images with a clear foreground are the most reliable, while selfies or highly filtered photos may not produce the intended depth. It is also worth noting that the clock and widgets remain legible regardless of the effect. iOS adjusts the layering automatically, ensuring important information is not obscured by the animated depth. This balance between motion and readability makes the feature practical as well as visually appealing. Experiencing the holographic lock screen Once your lock screen is set, tilting your iPhone causes the foreground and background to shift independently, creating a layered, three-dimensional look. The effect is subtle enough to avoid distraction but noticeable enough to make the lock screen feel alive. You can still change clock styles, colors and widget placements without disrupting the 3D effect. If you later decide you prefer a standard wallpaper, simply hold down on the lock screen and tap the hexagon icon to disable Spatial Scenes while keeping the photo intact.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-make-your-lock-screen-background-holographic-in-ios-26-110049999.html?src=rss",

As always, we have a bunch of new games for you to check out this weekend, along with fresh looks at some upcoming projects and a release date or two.But first, I really enjoyed this week's edition of The Guardian's Pushing Buttons newsletter. The publication's video games editor, Keza MacDonald, wrote about spending a day in a theater playing what sounds like the ultimate pass-the-controller game with dozens of other people. The attendees were there to experience Asses.Masses, which is designed to be played collaboratively. The aim is to help a herd of unemployed donkeys get their jobs back. Audience members take turns to pick up the controller, and everyone else in the room can offer advice. It sounds like a fascinating social experiment.New releases'Tis the season for scares, so of course we have to include some creepy games in this week's roundup. There was some buzz this week around The Séance of Blake Manor from Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury. This is a supernatural detective mystery game in which you investigate a woman's disappearance in 19th century Ireland.To solve the case, you'll have to interrogate suspects and keep track of environmental clues and other evidence. You’ll encounter strange goings-on as you conduct the investigation amid a gathering of mystics who are looking to speak to the dead on All Hallow's Eve. The art style is quite fetching, and the vibes remind me of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes and Blue Prince.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now on Steam. The regular price is $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 10.The Run is a choose-your-own-adventure-style interactive film from PRM Games, Benacus Entertainment and RNF Productions. It's an FMV experience in which you help a fitness influencer (played by Roxanne McKee, who appeared in Game of Thrones) make decisions and try to survive the masked figures who are hunting her in northern Italy. There are 20 possible deaths and around five endings. Legendary giallo filmmaker Dario Argento makes a cameo appearance too.It's neat to see more FMV games popping up (and we’ve got another one to highlight momentarily). The Run is out now on iOS for $10. It's coming to Android and Steam soon. You'll also be able to check it out at the Genesis Cinema in London. A two-month residency of The Run just started there. The audience votes on choices using glowsticks.Solo developer Yannick Audéoud (aka Misty Whale) spent a decade making his debut game, Orbyss, and now it's out in the wild. This is a puzzle game that sees you switching between orbs to solve puzzles — bit like in Cocoon. Instead of a beetle that carries such spheres, you technically play as \"a firefly of energy\" that can bounce between the objects.Orbyss has time-manipulation puzzles and ones that involve drones. Audéoud has included accessibility features as well, such as visual cues to represent sound-based mechanics on screen. This self-published game is on Steam. The regular price is $15 and there's a 15 percent discount until November 12.Death by Scrolling is the latest game from Ron Gilbert's Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse Software. The famed director of the first two Monkey Island games (who has had a hand in so many other great games over the years) has now created a vertically scrolling roguelite.The idea here is to stay alive long enough and earn enough gold to pay a ferryman and escape purgatory. I'm probably not going to jump into another roguelite for a minute since I'm still recovering from my time with CloverPit and Ball x Pit, but I definitely want to try out Death by Scrolling at some point. It'll typically run you $8 on Steam, but there's a 10 percent discount until November 11.Upcoming Here's another FMV game for you. This one is all about taking care of a very, very good dog. Golden Retriever Simple Life features Pichu, the pet pooch of developer Pablo Coma (Rablo Games). You'll feed, train and play with the doggo. Going on walks and learning tricks is part of the fun too. There's no release window as yet for Golden Retriever Simple Life, which is coming to Steam. In the meantime, you can stay up to date on the game's progress with developer updates Good Boy Diaries from Pichu.I've seen Egging On pop up from time to time and I've been looking forward to checking it out. I won't have to wait much longer to do that as it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC (Xbox app and Steam) on November 6. It'll hit Game Pass on day one.In this precision platformer, you play as an egg (yes, a hen's egg) that tries to escape a farm. Fall too far and... well, you can probably guess what happens. Egobounds developed Egging On, and Alibi Games and IndieArk are the game's publishers. Anchor takes the format of games like Rust and Valheim and plunges you into the depths of the sea in the wake of a nuclear holocaust. The multiplayer survival game is slated to support more than 150 players per server and there are plans to expand that. You and your friends will take charge of genetically engineered beings and build a base that you have to defend from threats such as \"failed clone experiments\" and raids from other players. Things will change in this world even when you're not playing the game, so you'd better make sure your base is secure. Sharks are a major factor in Anchor as well. They aren't always necessarily hostile. But, as in real life, they're attracted to blood, so any damage you sustain could spell doom.Fearem is the developer of Anchor, which doesn't yet have a release window. It has set course for Steam.Hi everyone!Yes as ID@Xbox Showcase Fall 2025 announcement earlier, it's coming soon to Xbox PC and Xbox Series X|S too for launch day.We heard that there's no default subtitle loaded in the IGN Showcase, here's the one that do! also thankyou for your support @jokoanwar… pic.twitter.com/xFEuC5F0xA— Separuh Interactive | WISHLIST AGNI: VOC NOW! (@SeparuhGames) October 29, 2025 There's a lot going on in this trailer for Agni: Village of Calamity, which premiered during the ID@Xbox indie showcase this week. In this debut title from Separuh Interactive, you play as Agni, an investigator who undertakes an unauthorized investigation in a remote village. You'll need to solve puzzles and fend off monsters as you try to uncover the village's secrets and find your missing partner.Agni: Village of Calamity is steeped in Indonesian folklore. The one large monster that speaks in a childlike voice is quite unsettling. I'm intrigued to learn more about this survival horror game. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox PC and Steam in 2026.Let's wrap things up for this week with one more survival horror tale. There's often horror in beauty and vice versa (take a look at Silent Hill f, for instance). The Florist leans into both as well. As Jessica Park, you deliver a flower arrangement to a lakeside town. But an affliction takes over the area, causing the spread of flora that snares victims and turns them into monsters. For what it's worth, the teaser in that final shot of the trailer reminds me of a certain sequence from The Last of Us Part II. Unclear Games is taking an old-school approach here as it's using a fixed-camera design. You likely know the drill here: solving puzzles and defeating foes is your only way to stay alive. Finding out information about floral specimens will be helpful too. The Florist is coming to Steam in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-supernatural-detective-mystery-fmv-terror-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000853.html?src=rss",

Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $39 (14 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Anker MagGo power bank with kickstand (Qi2, 15W, 10K) for $57 (37 percent off): One of our favorite power banks, this brick from Anker gives you 10K capacity in a magnetic, relatively slim package. The built-in kickstand makes it easy to watch videos or make FaceTime calls while powering up, and the small display on the bank's edge will show you how much power is flowing to your phone. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Shark Steam and Scrub Steamer Mop for $110 (31 percent off): This is a slightly more affordable version of this Shark steamer I bought earlier this year and has become one of my favorite things. The one on sale has almost an identical design and arguably the most important feature: rotating dual pads on the bottom that actually lift up the dirt and stains on your floor without too much extra elbow grease needed on your part. It also has three different cleaning modes to choose from, depending on how stubborn the mess is that you're trying to clean up. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.

          "standfirst": "If you’re looking for a live TV streaming service, you probably want to watch live sports, catch local news or get access to your favorite linear channels — perhaps you want all three. Cable was once the only way to get all that content in one place, but for a decade or so now, live TV streaming services have provided an alternative that’s less confusing, easier to cancel and somewhat less expensive, though price hikes from every major streamer have brought the starting price to over $80 monthly for most plans.There are also plenty of free live TV streaming services from operators like Tubi, Pluto and Plex. And traditional streaming services like Peacock, Prime Video, Max, Apple TV+ and even Netflix are broadcasting live sporting events and shows. That's all to say that picking the best live TV streaming service may take some consideration. We tested every major option, spelling out the prices, pros, cons and features of each one to help you out.Editor's note: Each week brings new announcements in the live TV streaming world. YouTube TV resolved its dispute with NBC Universal only to get into another kerfuffle with Disney that caused ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and other networks to go dark on YouTube TV. For its part, Disney has completed combining the businesses of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV (which will continue to operate as separate entities for now) and CNN is again offering its own streaming service, called All Access, but it doesn’t include live CNN. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "content": "If you’re looking for a live TV streaming service, you probably want to watch live sports, catch local news or get access to your favorite linear channels — perhaps you want all three. Cable was once the only way to get all that content in one place, but for a decade or so now, live TV streaming services have provided an alternative that’s less confusing, easier to cancel and somewhat less expensive, though price hikes from every major streamer have brought the starting price to over $80 monthly for most plans.There are also plenty of free live TV streaming services from operators like Tubi, Pluto and Plex. And traditional streaming services like Peacock, Prime Video, Max, Apple TV+ and even Netflix are broadcasting live sporting events and shows. That's all to say that picking the best live TV streaming service may take some consideration. We tested every major option, spelling out the prices, pros, cons and features of each one to help you out.Editor's note: Each week brings new announcements in the live TV streaming world. YouTube TV resolved its dispute with NBC Universal only to get into another kerfuffle with Disney that caused ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and other networks to go dark on YouTube TV. For its part, Disney has completed combining the businesses of Fubo and Hulu + Live TV (which will continue to operate as separate entities for now) and CNN is again offering its own streaming service, called All Access, but it doesn’t include live CNN. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.

          "title": "Large reasoning models almost certainly can think",
          "standfirst": "Recently, there has been a lot of hullabaloo about the idea that large reasoning models (LRM) are unable to think. This is mostly due to a research article published by Apple, \"The Illusion of Thinking\" Apple argues that LRMs must not be able to think; instead, they just perform pattern-matching. The evidence they provided is that LRMs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are unable to carry on the calculation using a predefined algorithm as the problem grows.This is a fundamentally flawed argument. If you ask a human who already knows the algorithm for solving the Tower-of-Hanoi problem to solve a Tower-of-Hanoi problem with twenty discs, for instance, he or she would almost certainly fail to do so. By that logic, we must conclude that humans cannot think either. However, this argument only points to the idea that there is no evidence that LRMs cannot think. This alone certainly does not mean that LRMs can think — just that we cannot be sure they don’t.In this article, I will make a bolder claim: LRMs almost certainly can think. I say ‘almost’ because there is always a chance that further research would surprise us. But I think my argument is pretty conclusive.What is thinking?Before we try to understand if LRMs can think, we need to define what we mean by thinking. But first, we have to make sure that humans can think per the definition. We will only consider thinking in relation to problem solving, which is the matter of contention.1. Problem representation (frontal and parietal lobes)When you think about a problem, the process engages your prefrontal cortex. This region is responsible for working memory, attention and executive functions — capacities that let you hold the problem in mind, break it into sub-components and set goals. Your parietal cortex helps encode symbolic structure for math or puzzle problems.2. Mental simulation (morking Memory and inner speech)This has two components: One is an auditory loop that lets you talk to yourself — very similar to CoT generation. The other is visual imagery, which allows you to manipulate objects visually. Geometry was so important for navigating the world that we developed specialized capabilities for it. The auditory part is linked to Broca’s area and the auditory cortex, both reused from language centers. The visual cortex and parietal areas primarily control the visual component.3. Pattern matching and retrieval (Hippocampus and Temporal Lobes)These actions depend on past experiences and stored knowledge from long-term memory:The hippocampus helps retrieve related memories and facts.The temporal Lobe brings in semantic knowledge — meanings, rules, categories.This is similar to how neural networks depend on their training to process the task.4. Monitoring and evaluation (Anterior Cingulate Cortex)Our anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) monitors for errors, conflicts or impasses — it’s where you notice contradictions or dead ends. This process is essentially based on pattern matching from prior experience.5. Insight or reframing (default mode network and right hemisphere)When you&#x27;re stuck, your brain might shift into default mode — a more relaxed, internally-directed network. This is when you step back, let go of the current thread and sometimes ‘suddenly’ see a new angle (the classic “aha!” moment).This is similar to how DeepSeek-R1 was trained for CoT reasoning without having CoT examples in its training data. Remember, the brain continuously learns as it processes data and solves problems.In contrast, LRMs aren’t allowed to change based on real-world feedback during prediction or generation. But with DeepSeek-R1’s CoT training, learning did happen as it attempted to solve the problems — essentially updating while reasoning.Similarities betweem CoT reasoning and biological thinkingLRM does not have all of the faculties mentioned above. For example, an LRM is very unlikely to do too much visual reasoning in its circuit, although a little may happen. But it certainly does not generate intermediate images in the CoT generation.Most humans can make spatial models in their heads to solve problems. Does this mean we can conclude that LRMs cannot think? I would disagree. Some humans also find it difficult to form spatial models of the concepts they think about. This condition is called aphantasia. People with this condition can think just fine. In fact, they go about life as if they don’t lack any ability at all. Many of them are actually great at symbolic reasoning and quite good at math — often enough to compensate for their lack of visual reasoning. We might expect our neural network models also to be able to circumvent this limitation.If we take a more abstract view of the human thought process described earlier, we can see mainly the following things involved:1. Pattern-matching is used for recalling learned experience, problem representation and monitoring and evaluating chains of thought.2. Working memory is to store all the intermediate steps.3. Backtracking search concludes that the CoT is not going anywhere and backtracks to some reasonable point.Pattern-matching in an LRM comes from its training. The whole point of training is to learn both knowledge of the world and the patterns to process that knowledge effectively. Since an LRM is a layered network, the entire working memory needs to fit within one layer. The weights store the knowledge of the world and the patterns to follow, while processing happens between layers using the learned patterns stored as model parameters.Note that even in CoT, the entire text — including the input, CoT and part of the output already generated — must fit into each layer. Working memory is just one layer (in the case of the attention mechanism, this includes the KV-cache).CoT is, in fact, very similar to what we do when we are talking to ourselves (which is almost always). We nearly always verbalize our thoughts, and so does a CoT reasoner.There is also good evidence that CoT reasoner can take backtracking steps when a certain line of reasoning seems futile. In fact, this is what the Apple researchers saw when they tried to ask the LRMs to solve bigger instances of simple puzzles. The LRMs correctly recognized that trying to solve the puzzles directly would not fit in their working memory, so they tried to figure out better shortcuts, just like a human would do. This is even more evidence that LRMs are thinkers, not just blind followers of predefined patterns.But why would a next-token-predictor learn to think?Neural networks of sufficient size can learn any computation, including thinking. But a next-word-prediction system can also learn to think. Let me elaborate. A general idea is LRMs cannot think because, at the end of the day, they are just predicting the next token; it is only a &#x27;glorified auto-complete.&#x27; This view is fundamentally incorrect — not that it is an &#x27;auto-complete,&#x27; but that an &#x27;auto-complete&#x27; does not have to think. In fact, next word prediction is far from a limited representation of thought. On the contrary, it is the most general form of knowledge representation that anyone can hope for. Let me explain.Whenever we want to represent some knowledge, we need a language or a system of symbolism to do so. Different formal languages exist that are very precise in terms of what they can express. However, such languages are fundamentally limited in the kinds of knowledge they can represent.For example, first-order predicate logic cannot represent properties of all predicates that satisfy a certain property, because it doesn&#x27;t allow predicates over predicates.Of course, there are higher-order predicate calculi that can represent predicates on predicates to arbitrary depths. But even they cannot express ideas that lack precision or are abstract in nature.Natural language, however, is complete in expressive power — you can describe any concept in any level of detail or abstraction. In fact, you can even describe concepts about natural language using natural language itself. That makes it a strong candidate for knowledge representation.The challenge, of course, is that this expressive richness makes it harder to process the information encoded in natural language. But we don’t necessarily need to understand how to do it manually — we can simply program the machine using data, through a process called training.A next-token prediction machine essentially computes a probability distribution over the next token, given a context of preceding tokens. Any machine that aims to compute this probability accurately must, in some form, represent world knowledge.A simple example: Consider the incomplete sentence, \"The highest mountain peak in the world is Mount ...\" — to predict the next word as Everest, the model must have this knowledge stored somewhere. If the task requires the model to compute the answer or solve a puzzle, the next-token predictor needs to output CoT tokens to carry the logic forward.This implies that, even though it’s predicting one token at a time, the model must internally represent at least the next few tokens in its working memory — enough to ensure it stays on the logical path.If you think about it, humans also predict the next token — whether during speech or when thinking using the inner voice. A perfect auto-complete system that always outputs the right tokens and produces correct answers would have to be omniscient. Of course, we’ll never reach that point — because not every answer is computable.However, a parameterized model that can represent knowledge by tuning its parameters, and that can learn through data and reinforcement, can certainly learn to think.Does it produce the effects of thinking?At the end of the day, the ultimate test of thought is a system’s ability to solve problems that require thinking. If a system can answer previously unseen questions that demand some level of reasoning, it must have learned to think — or at least to reason — its way to the answer.We know that proprietary LRMs perform very well on certain reasoning benchmarks. However, since there&#x27;s a possibility that some of these models were fine-tuned on benchmark test sets through a backdoor, we’ll focus only on open-source models for fairness and transparency.We evaluate them using the following benchmarks:As one can see, in some benchmarks, LRMs are able to solve a significant number of logic-based questions. While it’s true that they still lag behind human performance in many cases, it’s important to note that the human baseline often comes from individuals trained specifically on those benchmarks. In fact, in certain cases, LRMs outperform the average untrained human.ConclusionBased on the benchmark results, the striking similarity between CoT reasoning and biological reasoning, and the theoretical understanding that any system with sufficient representational capacity, enough training data, and adequate computational power can perform any computable task — LRMs meet those criteria to a considerable extent.It is therefore reasonable to conclude that LRMs almost certainly possess the ability to think.Debasish Ray Chawdhuri is a senior principal engineer at Talentica Software and a Ph.D. candidate in Cryptography at IIT Bombay.

          "content": "Recently, there has been a lot of hullabaloo about the idea that large reasoning models (LRM) are unable to think. This is mostly due to a research article published by Apple, \"The Illusion of Thinking\" Apple argues that LRMs must not be able to think; instead, they just perform pattern-matching. The evidence they provided is that LRMs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are unable to carry on the calculation using a predefined algorithm as the problem grows.This is a fundamentally flawed argument. If you ask a human who already knows the algorithm for solving the Tower-of-Hanoi problem to solve a Tower-of-Hanoi problem with twenty discs, for instance, he or she would almost certainly fail to do so. By that logic, we must conclude that humans cannot think either. However, this argument only points to the idea that there is no evidence that LRMs cannot think. This alone certainly does not mean that LRMs can think — just that we cannot be sure they don’t.In this article, I will make a bolder claim: LRMs almost certainly can think. I say ‘almost’ because there is always a chance that further research would surprise us. But I think my argument is pretty conclusive.What is thinking?Before we try to understand if LRMs can think, we need to define what we mean by thinking. But first, we have to make sure that humans can think per the definition. We will only consider thinking in relation to problem solving, which is the matter of contention.1. Problem representation (frontal and parietal lobes)When you think about a problem, the process engages your prefrontal cortex. This region is responsible for working memory, attention and executive functions — capacities that let you hold the problem in mind, break it into sub-components and set goals. Your parietal cortex helps encode symbolic structure for math or puzzle problems.2. Mental simulation (morking Memory and inner speech)This has two components: One is an auditory loop that lets you talk to yourself — very similar to CoT generation. The other is visual imagery, which allows you to manipulate objects visually. Geometry was so important for navigating the world that we developed specialized capabilities for it. The auditory part is linked to Broca’s area and the auditory cortex, both reused from language centers. The visual cortex and parietal areas primarily control the visual component.3. Pattern matching and retrieval (Hippocampus and Temporal Lobes)These actions depend on past experiences and stored knowledge from long-term memory:The hippocampus helps retrieve related memories and facts.The temporal Lobe brings in semantic knowledge — meanings, rules, categories.This is similar to how neural networks depend on their training to process the task.4. Monitoring and evaluation (Anterior Cingulate Cortex)Our anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) monitors for errors, conflicts or impasses — it’s where you notice contradictions or dead ends. This process is essentially based on pattern matching from prior experience.5. Insight or reframing (default mode network and right hemisphere)When you&#x27;re stuck, your brain might shift into default mode — a more relaxed, internally-directed network. This is when you step back, let go of the current thread and sometimes ‘suddenly’ see a new angle (the classic “aha!” moment).This is similar to how DeepSeek-R1 was trained for CoT reasoning without having CoT examples in its training data. Remember, the brain continuously learns as it processes data and solves problems.In contrast, LRMs aren’t allowed to change based on real-world feedback during prediction or generation. But with DeepSeek-R1’s CoT training, learning did happen as it attempted to solve the problems — essentially updating while reasoning.Similarities betweem CoT reasoning and biological thinkingLRM does not have all of the faculties mentioned above. For example, an LRM is very unlikely to do too much visual reasoning in its circuit, although a little may happen. But it certainly does not generate intermediate images in the CoT generation.Most humans can make spatial models in their heads to solve problems. Does this mean we can conclude that LRMs cannot think? I would disagree. Some humans also find it difficult to form spatial models of the concepts they think about. This condition is called aphantasia. People with this condition can think just fine. In fact, they go about life as if they don’t lack any ability at all.
