          "standfirst": "Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy. Table of contents The best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device How we tested Bluetooth trackers Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Bluetooth tracker FAQs Best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. Device compatibility Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags. Finding network Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range. Apple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US Now that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices. Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users. In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Samsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs. Amy Skorheim / Engadget Separation alerts A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house. Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item. Connectivity and volume The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device. If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature. The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels. Design and alternative formats Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring. You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The SmartLock from KeySmart is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag. Battery life AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable). Stalking, theft and data privacy AirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android. Last year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose. How we tested Bluetooth trackers Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options. Here’s the full list of every tracker we tested: Apple AirTag Chipolo Card Spot Chipolo One Spot Chipolo One Chipolo Card Chipolo Loop Chipolo Pop KeySmart SmartLock Motorola Moto Tag Pebblebe Clip Universal Pebblebee Clip Samsung SmartTag 2 Chipolo One Point Pebblebee Clip for Android Tile Pro (2024) Tile Mate (2024) Tile Mate (2022) Tile Pro (2022) Tile Slim (2022) After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use. As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Motorola Moto Tag The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house. It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself just out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better. Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024) Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices. There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob. I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).

For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks). Recent Updates October 2025: Added Chipolo Loop as a new pick for best rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. Detailed our experience with the Moto Tag and KeySmart SmartLock. Updated details about separation alerts and Ultra Wideband tech. August 2025: Updated the name of Google's finding network to Find Hub, instead of Find My Device.

We’re testing out the new services and we’ll let you know how the new options affect your options. For now, these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get for your money.Editor's note: There’s been a lot of hubbub in the streaming world lately. YouTube TV subscribers nearly missed out on access to NBC Universal channels — but the companies ultimately came to a multi-year agreement. Disney (and by extension Hulu+ Live TV) lost a whole bunch of subscribers over free speech dissent — and then announced a price hike for Hulu+ Live TV, bringing it to $90 monthly. Philo implemented a $5 monthly price increase, but users will now get to watch HBO Max and Discovery+, so it’s not all bad. Speaking of HBO Max, customers will no longer get CNN’s livestream as of November 17 because the latter entity is going to try yet again to offer its own service. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "standfirst": "Like clockwork, Apple has introduced a new M-series chip on updated versions of the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and for the first time, Apple Vision Pro. The new M5 chip shares plenty of similarities with the M4 chip Apple introduced in 2024, but the biggest seems to be a focus on improving graphics and AI performance.The M5 chip is made using a new third-generation 3nm process, according to Apple, with an updated 10-core GPU architecture on all versions that offers four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4, while carrying over support for things like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The M5 also features a 10-core CPU, just like the M4, with six efficiency and up to four performance cores. The M5 chip configurations for the iPad Pro.AppleThat is unless you're buying an M5 iPad Pro. The 1TB and 2TB models of the Pro feature a 10-core CPU and GPU, but if you opt for a smaller storage size of 256GB or 512GB, you'll get a nine-core CPU with six efficiency cores and three performance cores. Apple says the 10-core CPU offers \"up to 15 percent faster multithreaded performance\" over the M4 chip, though it's not clear if that's due to the CPU or memory improvements. That’s because the new chip offers an improved memory bandwidth of 153GB/s, up from the starting 120GB/s bandwidth on the M4, though less than what you can get with the M4 Pro or M4 Max. Apple will likely release M5 versions of both chips next year, but it's worth knowing what you're missing if you opt for the M5 right now.The performance gains Apple was able to squeeze out of its new GPU and improved memory bandwidth seem like the biggest changes users will actually notice from the M5. That includes \"up to 30 percent faster\" graphics performance than the M4 and \"up to a 45 percent graphics uplift in apps using ray tracing.\" Apple introduced the M4 with a focus on dynamic caching and ray tracing, and it seems like the M5 makes both graphical processes more efficient. The gains are apparently even more noticeable on the M5 Vision Pro, where the headset can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate, up from the 100Hz max Apple guaranteed before, and is now able to render \"10 percent more pixels.\"AI performance is also improved, though not necessarily thanks to the M5's 16-core Neural Engine alone, which seems to be the same Neural Engine used in the M4. Instead, Apple's taking a new approach to AI processing by including dedicated \"Neural Accelerators\" in each core of its GPU. This extra help has led to faster performance when devices are using Apple Intelligence skills or AI-powered features like the Vision Pro's ability to generate a Persona, according to Apple.In-depth testing and benchmarking of Apple's new M5 devices will be required to accurately capture how the M5 chip changes things, especially when it comes to general CPU performance. For now, though, Apple's chips continue to get more graphically powerful, which bodes well for anyone who uses MacBooks and iPads for creative tasks, AI or playing games.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-m5-chip-pushes-ai-performance-with-new-neural-accelerators-193745702.html?src=rss",

The decision effectively democratizes access to what the company characterizes as \"near-frontier-level intelligence\" — capabilities that would have been available only in expensive, premium models months ago.\"The launch of Claude Haiku 4.5 means that near-frontier-level intelligence is available for free to all users through Claude.ai,\" the Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"It also offers significant advantages to our enterprise customers: Sonnet 4.5 can handle frontier planning while Haiku 4.5 powers sub-agents, enabling multi-agent systems that tackle complex refactors, migrations, and large features builds with speed and quality.\"This multi-agent architecture signals a significant shift in how AI systems are deployed. Rather than relying on a single, monolithic model, enterprises can now orchestrate teams of specialized AI agents: a more sophisticated Sonnet 4.5 model breaking down complex problems and delegating subtasks to multiple Haiku 4.5 agents working in parallel. For software development teams, this could mean Sonnet 4.5 plans a major code refactoring while Haiku 4.5 agents simultaneously execute changes across dozens of files.The approach mirrors how human organizations distribute work, and could prove particularly valuable for enterprises seeking to balance performance with cost efficiency — a critical consideration as AI deployment scales.Inside Anthropic&#x27;s path to $7 billion in annual revenueThe model launch coincides with revelations that Anthropic&#x27;s business is experiencing explosive growth. The company&#x27;s annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion this month, Anthropic told Reuters, up from more than $5 billion reported in August. Internal projections obtained by Reuters suggest the company is targeting between $20 billion and $26 billion in annualized revenue for 2026, representing growth of more than 200% to nearly 300%.The company now serves more than 300,000 business customers, with enterprise products accounting for approximately 80% of revenue. Among Anthropic&#x27;s most successful offerings is Claude Code, a code-generation tool that has reached nearly $1 billion in annualized revenue since launching earlier this year.Those numbers come as artificial intelligence enters what many in the industry characterize as a critical inflection point. After two years of what Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger recently described as \"AI FOMO\" — where companies adopted AI tools without clear success metrics — enterprises are now demanding measurable returns on investment.\"The best products can be grounded in some kind of success metric or evaluation,\" Krieger said on the \"Superhuman AI\" podcast. \"I&#x27;ve seen that a lot in talking to companies that are deploying AI.\"For enterprises evaluating AI tools, the calculus increasingly centers on concrete productivity gains. Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed in June that AI had generated a 10% boost in engineering velocity at his company — though measuring such improvements across different roles and use cases remains challenging, as Krieger acknowledged.Why AI safety testing matters more than ever for enterprise adoptionAnthropic&#x27;s launch comes amid heightened scrutiny of the company&#x27;s approach to AI safety and regulation. On Tuesday, David Sacks, the White House&#x27;s AI \"czar\" and a venture capitalist, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering\" that is \"damaging the startup ecosystem.\"The attack targeted remarks by Jack Clark, Anthropic&#x27;s British co-founder and head of policy, who had described being \"deeply afraid\" of AI&#x27;s trajectory. Clark told Bloomberg he found Sacks&#x27; criticism \"perplexing.\"Anthropic addressed such concerns head-on in its release materials, emphasizing that Haiku 4.5 underwent extensive safety testing. The company classified the model as ASL-2 — its AI Safety Level 2 standard — compared to the more restrictive ASL-3 designation for the more powerful Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 models.\"Our teams have red-teamed and tested our agentic capabilities to the limits in order to assess whether it can be used to engage in harmful activity like generating misinformation or promoting fraudulent behavior like scams,\" the spokesperson told VentureBeat. \"In our automated alignment assessment, it showed a statistically significantly lower overall rate of misaligned behaviors than both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.1 — making it, by this metric, our safest model yet.\"The company said its safety testing showed Haiku 4.5 poses only limited risks regarding the production of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. Anthropic has also implemented classifiers designed to detect and filter prompt injection attacks, a common method for attempting to manipulate AI systems into producing harmful content.The emphasis on safety reflects Anthropic&#x27;s founding mission. The company was established in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, including siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who left amid concerns about OpenAI&#x27;s direction following its partnership with Microsoft. Anthropic has positioned itself as taking a more cautious, research-oriented approach to AI development.Benchmark results show Haiku 4.5 competing with larger, more expensive modelsAccording to Anthropic&#x27;s benchmarks, Haiku 4.5 performs competitively with or exceeds several larger models across multiple evaluation criteria. On SWE-bench Verified, a widely used test measuring AI systems&#x27; ability to solve real-world software engineering problems, Haiku 4.5 scored 73.3% — slightly ahead of Sonnet 4&#x27;s 72.7% and close to GPT-5 Codex&#x27;s 74.5%.The model demonstrated particular strength in computer use tasks, achieving 50.7% on the OSWorld benchmark compared to Sonnet 4&#x27;s 42.2%. This capability allows the AI to interact directly with computer interfaces — clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating applications — which could prove transformative for automating routine digital tasks.In coding-specific benchmarks like Terminal-Bench, which tests AI agents&#x27; ability to complete complex software tasks using command-line tools, Haiku 4.5 scored 41.0%, trailing only Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s 50.0% among Claude models.The model maintains a 200,000-token context window for standard users, with developers accessing the Claude Developer Platform able to use a 1-million-token context window. That expanded capacity means the model can process extremely large codebases or documents in a single request — roughly equivalent to a 1,500-page book.What three major AI model releases in two months says about the competitionWhen asked about the rapid succession of model releases, the Anthropic spokesperson emphasized the company&#x27;s focus on execution rather than competitive positioning.\"We&#x27;re focused on shipping the best possible products for our customers — and our shipping velocity speaks for itself,\" the spokesperson said. \"What was state-of-the-art just five months ago is now faster, cheaper, and more accessible.\"That velocity stands in contrast to the company&#x27;s earlier, more measured release schedule. Anthropic appeared to have paused development of its Haiku line after releasing version 3.5 at the end of last year, leading some observers to speculate the company had deprioritized smaller models.That rapid price-performance improvement validates a core promise of artificial intelligence: that capabilities will become dramatically cheaper over time as the technology matures and companies optimize their models. For enterprises, it suggests that today&#x27;s budget constraints around AI deployment may ease considerably in coming years.From customer service to code: Real-world applications for faster, cheaper AIThe practical applications of Haiku 4.5 span a wide range of enterprise functions, from customer service to financial analysis to software development. The model&#x27;s combination of speed and intelligence makes it particularly suited for real-time, low-latency tasks like chatbot conversations and customer support interactions, where delays of even a few seconds can degrade user experience.In financial services, the multi-agent architecture enabled by pairing Sonnet 4.5 with Haiku 4.5 could transform how firms monitor markets and manage risk. Anthropic envisions Haiku 4.5 monitoring thousands of data streams simultaneously — tracking regulatory changes, market signals and portfolio risks — while Sonnet 4.5 handles complex predictive modeling and strategic analysis.For research organizations, the division of labor could compress timelines dramatically. Sonnet 4.5 might orchestrate a comprehensive analysis while multiple Haiku 4.5 agents parallelize literature reviews, data gathering and document synthesis across dozens of sources, potentially \"compressing weeks of research into hours,\" according to Anthropic&#x27;s use case descriptions.Several companies have already integrated Haiku 4.5 and reported positive results. Guy Gur-Ari, co-founder of coding startup Augment, said the model \"hit a sweet spot we didn&#x27;t think was possible: near-frontier coding quality with blazing speed and cost efficiency.\" In Augment&#x27;s internal testing, Haiku 4.5 achieved 90% of Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s performance while matching much larger models.Jeff Wang, CEO of Windsurf, another coding-focused startup, said Haiku 4.5 \"is blurring the lines\" on traditional trade-offs between speed, cost and quality. \"It&#x27;s a fast frontier model that keeps costs efficient and signals where this class of models is headed.\"Jon Noronha, co-founder of presentation software company Gamma, reported that Haiku 4.5 \"outperformed our current models on instruction-following for slide text generation, achieving 65% accuracy versus 44% from our premium tier model — that&#x27;s a game-changer for our unit economics.\"The price of progress: What plummeting AI costs mean for enterprise strategyFor enterprises evaluating AI strategies, Haiku 4.5 presents both opportunity and challenge. The opportunity lies in accessing sophisticated AI capabilities at dramatically lower costs, potentially making viable entire categories of applications that were previously too expensive to deploy at scale.The challenge is keeping pace with a technology landscape that is evolving faster than most organizations can absorb. As Krieger noted in his recent podcast appearance, companies are moving beyond \"AI FOMO\" to demand concrete metrics and demonstrated value. But establishing those metrics and evaluation frameworks takes time — time that may be in short supply as competitors race ahead.The shift from single-model deployments to multi-agent architectures also requires new ways of thinking about AI systems. Rather than viewing AI as a monolithic assistant, enterprises must learn to orchestrate multiple specialized agents, each optimized for particular tasks — more akin to managing a team than operating a tool.The fundamental economics of AI are shifting with remarkable speed. Five months ago, Sonnet 4&#x27;s capabilities commanded premium pricing and represented the cutting edge. Today, Haiku 4.5 delivers similar performance at a third of the cost. If that trajectory continues — and both Anthropic&#x27;s release schedule and competitive pressure from OpenAI and Google suggest it will — the AI capabilities that seem remarkable today may be routine and inexpensive within a year.For Anthropic, the challenge will be translating technical achievements into sustainable business growth while maintaining the safety-focused approach that differentiates it from competitors. The company&#x27;s projected revenue growth to as much as $26 billion by 2026 suggests strong market traction, but achieving those targets will require continued innovation and successful execution across an increasingly complex product portfolio.Whether enterprises will choose Claude over increasingly capable alternatives from OpenAI, Google and a growing field of competitors remains an open question. But Anthropic is making a clear bet: that the future of AI belongs not to whoever builds the single most powerful model, but to whoever can deliver the right intelligence, at the right speed, at the right price — and make it accessible to everyone.In an industry where the promise of artificial intelligence has long outpaced reality, Anthropic is betting that delivering on that promise, faster and cheaper than anyone expected, will be enough to win. And with pricing dropping by two-thirds in just five months while performance holds steady, that promise is starting to look like reality.",
          "content": "Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5 on Wednesday, a smaller and significantly cheaper artificial intelligence model that matches the coding capabilities of systems that were considered cutting-edge just months ago, marking the latest salvo in an intensifying competition to dominate enterprise AI.The model costs $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens — roughly one-third the price of Anthropic&#x27;s mid-sized Sonnet 4 model released in May, while operating more than twice as fast.

          "title": "Google releases new AI video model Veo 3.1 in Flow and API: what it means for enterprises",
          "standfirst": "As expected after days of leaks and rumors online, Google has unveiled Veo 3.1, its latest AI video generation model, bringing a suite of creative and technical upgrades aimed at improving narrative control, audio integration, and realism in AI-generated video. While the updates expand possibilities for hobbyists and content creators using Google’s online AI creation app, Flow, the release also signals a growing opportunity for enterprises, developers, and creative teams seeking scalable, customizable video tools.The quality is higher, the physics better, the pricing the same as before, and the control and editing features more robust and varied.My initial tests showed it to be a powerful and performant model that immediately delights with each generation. However, the look is more cinematic, polished and a little more \"artificial\" than by default than rivals such as OpenAI&#x27;s new Sora 2, released late last month, which may or may not be what a particular user is going after (Sora excels at handheld and \"candid\" style videos). Expanded Control Over Narrative and AudioVeo 3.1 builds on its predecessor, Veo 3 (released back in May 2025) with enhanced support for dialogue, ambient sound, and other audio effects. Native audio generation is now available across several key features in Flow, including “Frames to Video,” “Ingredients to Video,” and “Extend,\" which give users the ability to, respectively: turn still images into video; use items, characters and objects from multiple images in a single video; and generate longer clips than the initial 8 seconds, to more than 30 seconds or even 1+ plus when continuing from a prior clip&#x27;s final frame. Before, you had to add audio manually after using these features. This addition gives users greater command over tone, emotion, and storytelling — capabilities that have previously required post-production work.In enterprise contexts, this level of control may reduce the need for separate audio pipelines, offering an integrated way to create training content, marketing videos, or digital experiences with synchronized sound and visuals.Google noted in a blog post that the updates reflect user feedback calling for deeper artistic control and improved audio support. Gallegos emphasizes the importance of making edits and refinements possible directly in Flow, without reworking scenes from scratch.Richer Inputs and Editing CapabilitiesWith Veo 3.1, Google introduces support for multiple input types and more granular control over generated outputs. The model accepts text prompts, images, and video clips as input, and also supports:Reference images (up to three) to guide appearance and style in the final outputFirst and last frame interpolation to generate seamless scenes between fixed endpointsScene extension that continues a video’s action or motion beyond its current durationThese tools aim to give enterprise users a way to fine-tune the look and feel of their content—useful for brand consistency or adherence to creative briefs.Additional capabilities like “Insert” (add objects to scenes) and “Remove” (delete elements or characters) are also being introduced, though not all are immediately available through the Gemini API.Deployment Across PlatformsVeo 3.1 is accessible through several of Google’s existing AI services:Flow, Google’s own interface for AI-assisted filmmakingGemini API, targeted at developers building video capabilities into applicationsVertex AI, where enterprise integration will soon support Veo’s “Scene Extension” and other key featuresAvailability through these platforms allows enterprise customers to choose the right environment—GUI-based or programmatic—based on their teams and workflows.Pricing and AccessThe Veo 3.1 model is currently in preview and available only on the paid tier of the Gemini API. The cost structure is the same as Veo 3, the preceding generation of AI video models from Google.Standard model: $0.40 per second of videoFast model: $0.15 per secondThere is no free tier, and users are charged only if a video is successfully generated. This model is consistent with previous Veo versions and provides predictable pricing for budget-conscious enterprise teams.Technical Specs and Output ControlVeo 3.1 outputs video at 720p or 1080p resolution, with a 24 fps frame rate. Duration options include 4, 6, or 8 seconds from a text prompt or uploaded images, with the ability to extend videos up to 148 seconds (more than 2 and half minutes!) when using the “Extend” feature.New functionality also includes tighter control over subjects and environments. For example, enterprises can upload a product image or visual reference, and Veo 3.1 will generate scenes that preserve its appearance and stylistic cues across the video. This could streamline creative production pipelines for retail, advertising, and virtual content production teams.Initial ReactionsThe broader creator and developer community has responded to Veo 3.1’s launch with a mix of optimism and tempered critique—particularly when comparing it to rival models like OpenAI’s Sora 2.Matt Shumer, an AI founder of Otherside AI/Hyperwrite, and early adopter, described his initial reaction as “disappointment,” noting that Veo 3.1 is “noticeably worse than Sora 2” and also “quite a bit more expensive.”However, he acknowledged that Google’s tooling—such as support for references and scene extension—is a bright spot in the release.Travis Davids, a 3D digital artist and AI content creator, echoed some of that sentiment. While he noted improvements in audio quality, particularly in sound effects and dialogue, he raised concerns about limitations that remain in the system. These include the lack of custom voice support, an inability to select generated voices directly, and the continued cap at 8-second generations—despite some public claims about longer outputs.Davids also pointed out that character consistency across changing camera angles still requires careful prompting, whereas other models like Sora 2 handle this more automatically. He questioned the absence of 1080p resolution for users on paid tiers like Flow Pro and expressed skepticism over feature parity.On the more positive end, @kimmonismus, an AI newsletter writer, stated that “Veo 3.1 is amazing,” though still concluded that OpenAI’s latest model remains preferable overall.Collectively, these early impressions suggest that while Veo 3.1 delivers meaningful tooling enhancements and new creative control features, expectations have shifted as competitors raise the bar on both quality and usability.Adoption and ScaleSince launching Flow five months ago, Google says over 275 million videos have been generated across various Veo models. The pace of adoption suggests significant interest not only from individuals but also from developers and businesses experimenting with automated content creation.Thomas Iljic, Director of Product Management at Google Labs, highlights that Veo 3.1’s release brings capabilities closer to how human filmmakers plan and shoot. These include scene composition, continuity across shots, and coordinated audio—all areas that enterprises increasingly look to automate or streamline.Safety and Responsible AI UseVideos generated with Veo 3.1 are watermarked using Google’s SynthID technology, which embeds an imperceptible identifier to signal that the content is AI-generated. Google applies safety filters and moderation across its APIs to help minimize privacy and copyright risks. Generated content is stored temporarily and deleted after two days unless downloaded.For developers and enterprises, these features provide reassurance around provenance and compliance—critical in regulated or brand-sensitive industries.Where Veo 3.1 Stands Among a Crowded AI Video Model SpaceVeo 3.1 is not just an iteration on prior models—it represents a deeper integration of multimodal inputs, storytelling control, and enterprise-level tooling. While creative professionals may see immediate benefits in editing workflows and fidelity, businesses exploring automation in training, advertising, or virtual experiences may find even greater value in the model’s composability and API support.The early user feedback highlights that while Veo 3.1 offers valuable tooling, expectations around realism, voice control, and generation length are evolving rapidly. As Google expands access through Vertex AI and continues refining Veo, its competitive positioning in enterprise video generation will hinge on how quickly these user pain points are addressed.",

However, the look is more cinematic, polished and a little more \"artificial\" than by default than rivals such as OpenAI&#x27;s new Sora 2, released late last month, which may or may not be what a particular user is going after (Sora excels at handheld and \"candid\" style videos). Expanded Control Over Narrative and AudioVeo 3.1 builds on its predecessor, Veo 3 (released back in May 2025) with enhanced support for dialogue, ambient sound, and other audio effects. Native audio generation is now available across several key features in Flow, including “Frames to Video,” “Ingredients to Video,” and “Extend,\" which give users the ability to, respectively: turn still images into video; use items, characters and objects from multiple images in a single video; and generate longer clips than the initial 8 seconds, to more than 30 seconds or even 1+ plus when continuing from a prior clip&#x27;s final frame. Before, you had to add audio manually after using these features. This addition gives users greater command over tone, emotion, and storytelling — capabilities that have previously required post-production work.In enterprise contexts, this level of control may reduce the need for separate audio pipelines, offering an integrated way to create training content, marketing videos, or digital experiences with synchronized sound and visuals.Google noted in a blog post that the updates reflect user feedback calling for deeper artistic control and improved audio support. Gallegos emphasizes the importance of making edits and refinements possible directly in Flow, without reworking scenes from scratch.Richer Inputs and Editing CapabilitiesWith Veo 3.1, Google introduces support for multiple input types and more granular control over generated outputs. The model accepts text prompts, images, and video clips as input, and also supports:Reference images (up to three) to guide appearance and style in the final outputFirst and last frame interpolation to generate seamless scenes between fixed endpointsScene extension that continues a video’s action or motion beyond its current durationThese tools aim to give enterprise users a way to fine-tune the look and feel of their content—useful for brand consistency or adherence to creative briefs.Additional capabilities like “Insert” (add objects to scenes) and “Remove” (delete elements or characters) are also being introduced, though not all are immediately available through the Gemini API.Deployment Across PlatformsVeo 3.1 is accessible through several of Google’s existing AI services:Flow, Google’s own interface for AI-assisted filmmakingGemini API, targeted at developers building video capabilities into applicationsVertex AI, where enterprise integration will soon support Veo’s “Scene Extension” and other key featuresAvailability through these platforms allows enterprise customers to choose the right environment—GUI-based or programmatic—based on their teams and workflows.Pricing and AccessThe Veo 3.1 model is currently in preview and available only on the paid tier of the Gemini API. The cost structure is the same as Veo 3, the preceding generation of AI video models from Google.Standard model: $0.40 per second of videoFast model: $0.15 per secondThere is no free tier, and users are charged only if a video is successfully generated. This model is consistent with previous Veo versions and provides predictable pricing for budget-conscious enterprise teams.Technical Specs and Output ControlVeo 3.1 outputs video at 720p or 1080p resolution, with a 24 fps frame rate. Duration options include 4, 6, or 8 seconds from a text prompt or uploaded images, with the ability to extend videos up to 148 seconds (more than 2 and half minutes!) when using the “Extend” feature.New functionality also includes tighter control over subjects and environments. For example, enterprises can upload a product image or visual reference, and Veo 3.1 will generate scenes that preserve its appearance and stylistic cues across the video. This could streamline creative production pipelines for retail, advertising, and virtual content production teams.Initial ReactionsThe broader creator and developer community has responded to Veo 3.1’s launch with a mix of optimism and tempered critique—particularly when comparing it to rival models like OpenAI’s Sora 2.Matt Shumer, an AI founder of Otherside AI/Hyperwrite, and early adopter, described his initial reaction as “disappointment,” noting that Veo 3.1 is “noticeably worse than Sora 2” and also “quite a bit more expensive.”However, he acknowledged that Google’s tooling—such as support for references and scene extension—is a bright spot in the release.Travis Davids, a 3D digital artist and AI content creator, echoed some of that sentiment. While he noted improvements in audio quality, particularly in sound effects and dialogue, he raised concerns about limitations that remain in the system. These include the lack of custom voice support, an inability to select generated voices directly, and the continued cap at 8-second generations—despite some public claims about longer outputs.Davids also pointed out that character consistency across changing camera angles still requires careful prompting, whereas other models like Sora 2 handle this more automatically. He questioned the absence of 1080p resolution for users on paid tiers like Flow Pro and expressed skepticism over feature parity.On the more positive end, @kimmonismus, an AI newsletter writer, stated that “Veo 3.1 is amazing,” though still concluded that OpenAI’s latest model remains preferable overall.Collectively, these early impressions suggest that while Veo 3.1 delivers meaningful tooling enhancements and new creative control features, expectations have shifted as competitors raise the bar on both quality and usability.Adoption and ScaleSince launching Flow five months ago, Google says over 275 million videos have been generated across various Veo models. The pace of adoption suggests significant interest not only from individuals but also from developers and businesses experimenting with automated content creation.Thomas Iljic, Director of Product Management at Google Labs, highlights that Veo 3.1’s release brings capabilities closer to how human filmmakers plan and shoot. These include scene composition, continuity across shots, and coordinated audio—all areas that enterprises increasingly look to automate or streamline.Safety and Responsible AI UseVideos generated with Veo 3.1 are watermarked using Google’s SynthID technology, which embeds an imperceptible identifier to signal that the content is AI-generated. Google applies safety filters and moderation across its APIs to help minimize privacy and copyright risks. Generated content is stored temporarily and deleted after two days unless downloaded.For developers and enterprises, these features provide reassurance around provenance and compliance—critical in regulated or brand-sensitive industries.Where Veo 3.1 Stands Among a Crowded AI Video Model SpaceVeo 3.1 is not just an iteration on prior models—it represents a deeper integration of multimodal inputs, storytelling control, and enterprise-level tooling. While creative professionals may see immediate benefits in editing workflows and fidelity, businesses exploring automation in training, advertising, or virtual experiences may find even greater value in the model’s composability and API support.The early user feedback highlights that while Veo 3.1 offers valuable tooling, expectations around realism, voice control, and generation length are evolving rapidly. As Google expands access through Vertex AI and continues refining Veo, its competitive positioning in enterprise video generation will hinge on how quickly these user pain points are addressed.",

There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood.I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money.

At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs.Editor's note: This list has been completely overhauled and rewritten as of September 2025. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors. Table of contents Best VPNs for 2025 Other VPNs we tested What to look for in a VPN VPN FAQs Best VPNs for 2025 Other VPNs we tested The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. CyberGhost There's a lot to recommend with CyberGhost. Its streaming-optimized servers meet a high standard for playback quality, it's pretty fast overall and its Smart Rules offer some of the deepest VPN automation on the market. The ad blocker works well, and the NoSpy servers are a neat idea — CyberGhost keeps them under lock and key near its Romania headquarters and carefully fine-tunes all their settings. On the other hand, its apps just aren't up to the standard set by our favorites on this list. I like the designs on paper, but there are too many snags in the experience, from laggy connections to an overactive kill switch that often blocks internet access even when the VPN is working perfectly. I also have some concerns about its commitment to data privacy, since its privacy policy retains the right to share your personal data with its entire corporate family. CyberGhost's parent company, Kape Technologies, also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, but neither of those VPNs have privacy policies quite so permissive. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy.

          "standfirst": "For as long as I can remember, I've had trouble going to sleep. When I lay down, my mind inevitably starts racing a thousand miles an hour, thinking about anything and everything. On several recent nights, though, my pre-slumber thoughts had a singular focus. I mulled over possibilities like, \"What if I fuse a ball that heals my character with one that splits into smaller balls with the same effect, and add a passive that fires a baby ball every time I'm healed?\" Then I grab my PlayStation Portal and do just that until I doze off. This is the hold Ball x Pit has had over me. Kenny Sun and a small group of collaborators have cooked up a mesmerizing brick-breaking roguelite. Ball x Pit is a blend of dual-stick shoot-'em-up action, base building and about a dozen other things that keeps calling me back for one more run... and another, and another.After a cataclysmic event wipes out the city of Ballbylon and leaves an enormous pit, hunters descend into the depths in search of treasure. For our purposes, this means playing levels to collect resources in order to build structures in New Ballbylon. These buildings unlock perks, such as new characters, that help with future runs. The sickly chaos of the levels and the calmer city building aspect feed into each other smartly and combine for a satisfying loop.Base building in Ball x PitKenny Sun/Devolver DigitalThat’s not the only important interplay here. Like any good roguelite, Ball x Pit is all about finding synergies for maximum impact. It's right there in the title, with the \"x\" denoting a relationship between two things (it's derived from shipping in fandom parlance). In the pit, you battle monsters by — surprise! — firing balls at them. Along with regular “baby balls,” each character has a unique ability and a special starter ball. In the vein of Vampire Survivors, you'll unlock more special balls and passive abilities when you collect enough gems to level up. One ball has a chance to freeze enemies and another is slower but deals much more damage. There are dozens of others.The real fun comes in when you start fusing these balls and their effects together, freeing up space for another weapon. It gets even better when you're able to evolve a pair of balls into something new. It's possible to fuse evolved balls, or even evolve them again. There’s a strategic aspect to this, as you won’t want to fuse balls that can nearly cancel each other out, such as merging an area-of-effect ball with one that disappears on impact, or leave yourself with too few balls in the face of danger.Once I unlocked the option to take two characters on a run and combine their passive abilities, that's where things went into overdrive. The possibilities became very exciting at this point, and I ended up playing Ball x Pit way past my ideal bedtime as a result.It does take a while to get to that point, though. Progression is slow at first. The repetition can get to be a little much as you need to beat each stage multiple times before moving onto the next. Also, I wish there was a bit more to the game narratively than a basic setup and some character descriptions. But there's so much to consider on each run, and that’s what keeps me coming back. Each of the nine levels is set in a different biome, with its own hazards, enemies and bosses. Some late-game characters turn the game on its head by shifting playstyles in surprising ways, but I don't want to spoil those. Along with the absolute chaos and dopamine hits of slicing through enemies, discovering killer combinations between characters, special balls — especially the evolutions — and passives drives so much of the joy of this game.Whenever you do fuse or evolve a pair of balls, rather than having to click an \"OK\" button to get back in the action, the prompt reads \"Whoa.\" That's on the nose, but funny. And I'll be damned if I didn't say that very thing out loud many times when I saw what a new evolved ball could do. Ball x Pit is out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $15. It's available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is coming later this fall with a free upgrade from the Switch version.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pits-deeply-satisfying-grind-keeps-me-coming-back-for-more-171000754.html?src=rss",

          "title": "How to cancel Proton VPN and get a refund",
          "standfirst": "Proton VPN currently tops my list of the best VPNs, and I gave it a glowing recommendation in my detailed Proton VPN review. It's easy to use, fast, cheap and secure, with a large server network and one of the industry's best scores at unblocking streaming sites. All that said, there's no such thing as a perfect VPN, and you may find that Proton isn't working for you. If that happens, here's how to cancel your subscription. How to cancel Proton VPN through a browser If you initially signed up less than 30 days ago, you can cancel your subscription and request a refund by contacting tech support. See \"How to get a refund from Proton VPN\" below for details. If more than 30 days have passed, use the following steps to cancel your subscription. Open your browser and go to protonvpn.com. At the top-right, click Sign in, then enter your username and password. You'll be taken to your account dashboard. At the left side of the dashboard, click the Subscription tab. Scroll all the way down to the section labeled Cancel subscription. Click the \"Continue\" button. A pop-up window will appear, asking if you're sure. Click Cancel subscription. Sam Chapman for Engadget Cancelling this way doesn't immediately terminate service — it just means your subscription won't auto-renew. You can still use Proton VPN's paid features, including the entire server network, until the current period expires. After that, you'll be automatically downgraded to the free plan. During this time, your account dashboard will still be active, so you can use it to turn renewal back on if you change your mind. This method also works in mobile browser apps. Just follow the same steps on your mobile device and you'll cancel in the same way, with service continuing until your subscription expires. How to downgrade from Proton Unlimited to Proton VPN only A Proton Unlimited subscription applies to all Proton products. Since it's mainly founded on Proton Mail, though, downgrading to VPN service only is tricky and requires some extra steps. First, downgrade Proton Unlimited to Proton Free from your main account dashboard. Log in at account.proton.me, then click Settings, All settings, Dashboard and Your plan. Under \"Proton Unlimited,\" click Explore other Proton plans. On the next page, select Proton Free. This will effectively cancel Proton Unlimited, though you can still use it until the end of the pay period. Finally, go to the Proton VPN website (not the overall Proton site) and sign up for a Proton VPN Plus plan. Since you downgraded instead of deleting your account, you should be able to use the same account address. How to delete your Proton account on mobile You can also use the mobile app to delete your entire Proton account, instantly and irreversibly ending your subscriptions to Proton VPN, Proton Mail and any other products in the line. Taking this action permanently burns your Proton username, so you won't be able to use it again if you decide to re-subscribe (in that case, you’ll just have to make a new one). The process is the same on both Android and iOS — the apps have slight cosmetic differences, but everything is in the same place. Follow the steps below to nuke your Proton account from orbit. Open the Proton VPN app on your Android phone. Click Settings at the bottom of the window. At the top of the settings page, click your account email address. This will take you to Account settings. Click Delete account. A window will open in your web browser, showing your general Proton account page. Scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the red Delete your account button. Select a reason for deleting your account and leave feedback in the box provided. You have to pick an option from the menu and type at least 10 characters in the box, though feel free to keyboard mash if you don't want to say anything. Check the box on the next page beside \"Yes, I want to permanently delete this account and all its data.\" Finally, click the red Delete account button. Sam Chapman for Engadget How to get a refund from Proton VPN Proton VPN has a 30-day refund policy. As long as you paid for your VPN less than 30 days ago, you can get your money back. To request a refund, send a message through the contact form on the website. You can also email protonvpn@support.zendesk.com. There's a minimum of 100 characters in the \"What happened?\" box. Unlike when you're simply deleting your account, I do recommend putting a brief real answer here, clearly stating that you would like to cancel your account and receive a refund. Sam Chapman for Engadget According to its terms of service, Proton will only refund you for the portion of the service you didn't use. If you spend $10 for a one-month subscription and cancel after 15 days, you'll get $5 back. The terms do state that the company \"may also provide you with a full refund upon request\" — directly asking for such a refund in your contact form makes this more likely. If you cancel after 30 days are up, you may still be able to get a prorated payment for your remaining time, either in cash or account credit. You'll have to ask for this specifically, as the default option is that your account just stays active until it runs out. What to do if you subscribed through an app store If you bought your Proton VPN subscription through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, then Apple or Google processed your money and you're subject to their refund policies. If you subscribed through Apple, go to your Apple ID profile in iOS settings, click on Subscriptions, scroll to Proton VPN and click on Cancel subscription. You'll then get the opportunity to request a refund. On Android, log into the Google Play Store, click on your profile picture, then click Manage subscriptions. Find Proton VPN, click Cancel subscription and provide a reason. As with iOS, the steps will walk you through the refund process. Proton VPN alternatives Once you've fully cancelled Proton VPN, you may be in the market for an alternative. I recommend a few of my other favorites, depending on why Proton didn't work for you. Surfshark is faster, ExpressVPN has some of the best app design and NordVPN has a wider range of interesting features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The VSCO photo editing and sharing app has been around for nearly as long as Instagram, positioning itself as the serious photographer’s choice for mobile editing. The original focus was on tasteful filters and editing tools, all of which got significantly more powerful and flexible over time; VSCO has long been doing the same sort of film emulations that have made Fujifilm’s cameras so desirable in recent years. The company also built up a loyal community of photographers who share their edits far and wide, both in the VSCO app as well as on more mainstream platforms like Instagram itself. Now, the company is making an unsurprising but potentially controversial move: it is releasing its first AI-powered image editing tool. “Remove,” as the name suggests, lets you erase “unwanted elements” from your photos without compromising the image’s full resolution. At first glance, it feels quite similar to tools like Google’s own Magic Eraser. You just pop open an image in the editor and highlight the portion you want to remove, and VSCO will do its best to obliterate the offending bits and fill in whatever is in the background that it deems appropriate. I haven’t had a chance to test how effective this tool is yet, but VSCO is using Black Forest Lab’s FLUX.1 Kontext model to do its magic, combined with its own proprietary technology specifically focused on making results that the company says look authentic. A quick look at Black Forest Lab and the FLUX.1 model show a tool that does appear to be well-suited to removing unwanted parts of an image and properly filling in the space that remains — but we’ll have to see it in action to judge whether it does the job well.This new Remove tool isn’t the only AI-powered editor VSCO is working on. There’s also an Upscale tool in the works that the company says will “enhance image resolution” while keeping color and composition unchanged. These sorts of tools will live under a new umbrella the company is calling AI Lab, making it clear this will be an ongoing initiative and not just a one-off release.On one hand, I’m not at all surprised to see VSCO jumping into AI-powered editing; it has to keep up with the rest of the industry. But on the other hand, the company has made its mark by building a community of photographers who value authenticity in their work, something that cannot help but be in conflict with AI tools, at least on the surface.VSCO’s CEO Eric Wittman acknowledged that tension in a conversation with Engadget. “We have a very photographer-centric, creator-first point of view,” Wittman said. “But where we see AI fitting in is in support of those folks, and that work, and that vision. The intention isn’t to replace [that work], though — AI has a place, but it’s not to replace what creators, and photographers in particular, are doing.” That mindset makes sense with something like Remove, which duplicates something people have done with Photoshop for years. Rather than generating new images or radically changing the truth of a photo like you can do with some of Google’s tools on the Pixel phones, Remove is a bit more subtle. “You would use masks, you would manually painstakingly edit things at a pixel by pixel level,” Wittman said. “What a lot of Remove tools would do is basically like automate that.”Wittman also cited preserving image quality as a key part of the work behind its own Remove tool. “We know that many people who were attempting to use AI in the early days, especially photographers, a lot of their disappointment was just in the preservation of the integrity and the quality of the work,” he said. “So what we've really tried to do is continue to help automate where we can and make things easier, but also preserve the quality.” To that end, VSCO is stressing that all these edits are non-destructive and the output will be in full, original resolution. As VSCO starts dabbling in more AI editing tools, Wittman emphasized that the company wants to stay on the side of helping photographers realize a creative vision rather than helping them make entirely unreal images, while also avoiding the mess of copyright issues and inauthentic content that is flooding the internet thanks to AI. “When you think about things like copyright, and the incredible importance of copyright, integrity, and authenticity — we're big believers as a company in both the laws and the norms that have been around for many many years. But obviously on some platforms there are people who are maliciously manipulating things, and we don't want to be participants in that.”VSCO’s first AI Labs feature is available as of today in the VSCO app for iOS; it should come to Android eventually but there’s no word yet on specific timing. To use it, you’ll need an active VSCO Pro subscription, which runs $13 per month or $60 a year. A Pro plans contains a ton more than just AI Labs features, though — it unlocks a full editing suite on mobile and the web, professional profile and website creation, hundreds of presets and film emulation settings and a lot more.

          "title": "Apple's long-rumored smart display will reportedly cost $350",
          "standfirst": "Apple has been expected to widen its smart home offering for a long time now, and if a new report is accurate, we could be getting a trio of new devices fairly soon. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on an indoor camera and a smart display to arrive in 2026, as well as a tabletop robot, with the latter expected to launch in 2027. An Apple-made smart display in particular has featured heavily in the rumor mill for a number of years, but it appears to be closer than ever. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple’s new home hub will have a 7-inch square LCD display, a built-in FaceTime camera and an OS that dynamically adjusts depending on who’s using it. It will also ship with an improved version of Siri that will behave more like ChatGPT or other chatbots in how it uses the web to answer your questions. The product, along with the more advanced Siri chatbot, had been slated for release earlier this year, but Apple reportedly scrapped those plans in favor of a spring 2026 launch. Bloomberg claims there will be two versions of the home hub, one code-named J940 which takes the form of a display mounted on a HomePod mini-like speaker, and the other (J491) designed to be hung on a wall. With both you’ll be able to control smart appliances, play music and presumably interact with Apple’s various apps on other devices. Apple is said to be targeting a price of around $350, although the Bloomberg report does not specify which version of the device that price refers to. The tabletop robot scheduled to launch in 2027 will effectively be the smart display Apple could be releasing next year mounted into a motorized arm that can move the device to different positions, which sounds like the company’s take on Amazon’s (slightly creepy) swivelling Echo Show 10, first launched in 2021. This product will have a larger 9-inch display, but is said to be delayed after Apple encountered engineering challenges with the motor. Bloomberg reports that all three of these devices will be built in Vietnam, which sources said represented a \"major change\" in how Apple launches a new product category, as it has traditionally relied on China at the outset. In 2020 it emerged that Apple was looking to diversify its production by moving some of its iPad and MacBook manufacturing to Vietnam, and the US’ trade war with China has only intensified during Trump’s second administration. Vietnam has not escaped tariffs of its own, but they’re less severe than imports from China.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/apples-long-rumored-smart-display-will-reportedly-cost-350-165801748.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Apple's first M5 laptop is the 14-inch MacBook Pro",
          "standfirst": "The new M5 MacBook Pro has arrived — and brought something of a strategy change for Apple's chip release strategy this year. This time around, Apple has led with the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, which retains the same $1,599 starting price as its M4 predecessor. It debuts alongside new 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros and a refreshed Apple Vision Pro that have the same M5 chipset, but — unlike last year — there's no M5 Pro and M5 Max devices to be found. In the past, Apple has favored launching its entire MacBook Pro lineup at once, as it did in 2024 with the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max models. However, it may have decided to release the M5 model now so it could get a jump start on sales, since the M5 Pro and M5 Max versions are reportedly still several months away. Apple may have also opted for a low-key release since the M5 MacBook Pro is largely unchanged from the previous model. With that, the emphasis is squarely on the M5 chip and its extra performance. Reportedly due to cost reasons, Apple decided to use the same 3-nanometer fabrication process for the M5 as it did for the M4. The new chip has 10 GPU cores and 10 CPU cores, along with a 16-core Neural Engine. Apple claims the M5 has the \"world’s fastest CPU core\" with up to 20 percent faster multithreaded performance compared with the M4 chip. As for the GPU, the company says that offers \"up to 1.6x faster graphics performance in pro apps and enables up to 1.6x higher frame rates in games compared to the M4 model.\" That should make the M5 MacBook Pro a better option than the M4 model for things like gaming and video editing. To that end, compared with the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple says the latest model delivers up to 1.8x faster \"AI video-enhancing performance\" in Topaz Video, up to 1.7x faster 3D rendering in Blender and up to 1.2x faster build performance during code compiling in Xcode. The company is promising 3.5x faster AI performance than with the M4 model, and up to 6x faster performance than M1. It also claims SSD performance is up to twice as fast as the previous generation. The M5 MacBook Pro comes with the same 14.2-inch, 3,024 x 1,964 Liquid Retina XDR display that can hit 1,000 nits in SDR mode and up to 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content. It has adaptive refresh rates at up to 120Hz and offers a wide P3 color gamut with up to 1 billion colors, ideal for video editors and Lightroom users. Other key features include an SDXC card slot, HDMI port and 3.5mm headphone jack. There are three USB-C ports as before, but they're still the Thunderbolt 4 type with speeds up to 40 Gbps, and not the 80 Gbps Thunderbolt 5 ports found on M4 Pro and Max models. It also comes with a six-speaker system with support for Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio as before, along with Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 and a 12MP Center Stage 1080p webcam. As you might imagine, it comes with macOS Tahoe ready to go. Per the comparison page on Apple's site, except for the different CPU, the M5 MacBook Pro otherwise has identical specs to its M4 predecessor, right down to the same dimensions, weight and 70-watt power adapter. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is now available for pre-order starting at $1,599 with 16GB memory and 512GB storage. It maxes out at 32GB of RAM and 4TB of storage. Shipping will start October 22. Update, 12:52PM ET: Confirmed via Apple's spec page that there are no real differences between the M4 and M5 MacBook Pro aside from the new CPU.

          "title": "The best VPN deals: Get up to 87 percent off ProtonVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark and more",
          "standfirst": "A virtual private network (VPN) is useful in lots of ways every day, whether you're streaming foreign TV shows or keeping yourself anonymous online so advertisers can't track you. But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one — pricing can be opaque for these services, and you can't always trust how the providers portray their best deals. Even so, there are genuinely great deals to be had. VPN providers love to give out deep discounts to anybody willing to sign up for a year or more at once. This means you've got to pay out more upfront, but if you divide the cost by the months of service, you're actually paying less per month over time. With deals like this, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now. Best VPN deals NordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping. ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (86 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This evergreen deal gives you 86 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with two months free (73 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. However, if you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. What makes a good VPN deal Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "title": "Apple's new Vision Pro gets an M5 chip and Dual Knit Band, but it's still $3,499",
          "standfirst": "Apple has introduced an upgraded version of its Vision Pro headset that's powered by the company's M5 chip, its latest silicon that will also come with the new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. The first generation of the headset was equipped with Apple's M2, so you can expect this device to be faster and come with more capabilities. Apple hasn't budged the price from $3,499 with 256GB of storage, but at least it comes with a Dual Knit Band, which adds a top strap for extra security and comfort. (Existing Vision Pro users can also buy the Dual Knit Band separately for $99.) As you'd expect, Apple claims the refreshed Vision Pro should be faster while loading apps, browsing the web and doing just about everything. The M5 chip also includes a new 10-core GPU, with better support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, \"enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control,\" according to Apple. The company also says the M5 Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on its micro-OLED displays, which should make everything look a bit sharper. The M5 Vision Pro should last a bit longer than the original model, as well. Apple claims it supports up to two and a half hours of typical usage, and up to three hours of video playback. The previous model was rated for two hours of general usage and two and a half hours of video viewing. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a few days ago that Apple was due for another wave of product announcements. He wrote back then that the new iPad Pro and Vision Pro are already being mass produced and that Apple is \"gearing up for an imminent release.\" Apple had originally wanted to launch a a lighter and cheaper version of the Vision Pro headset, as well, but it reportedly decided to shift its focus on the development of smart glasses. The company pulled people working on the lighter Vision Pro, Gurman said in another report, and moved them to its smart glasses project. Apple is reportedly working on a smart glasses model with no display and is meant to pair with iPhones, along with another model that's equipped with a built-in screen and can directly compete with Meta's Ray-Ban Display. The company is aiming to release the model with no screen in 2027 and the one with a screen in 2028, Gurman said. \"The Vision Pro is a flawed product, but it's certainly not empty,\" we noted in our review of the original headset. \"It's as if Apple has compiled everything it's learned from building the Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods into a single device, all in a bid to avoid the Innovator's Dilemma.\" At first glance, the M5 Vision Pro doesn't seem to change that conclusion much, not without more content and apps built around spatial computing. A price drop and more storage on the base model would certainly make the Vision Pro more compelling, until that happens it'll remain more of a developer kit than a full-fledged consumer product. The M5 Vision Pro is now ready to pre-order and will once again set you back $3,499. Apple will start shipping the device on October 22.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/apples-new-vision-pro-gets-an-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band-but-its-still-3499-132123957.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Apple has introduced an upgraded version of its Vision Pro headset that's powered by the company's M5 chip, its latest silicon that will also come with the new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. The first generation of the headset was equipped with Apple's M2, so you can expect this device to be faster and come with more capabilities. Apple hasn't budged the price from $3,499 with 256GB of storage, but at least it comes with a Dual Knit Band, which adds a top strap for extra security and comfort. (Existing Vision Pro users can also buy the Dual Knit Band separately for $99.) As you'd expect, Apple claims the refreshed Vision Pro should be faster while loading apps, browsing the web and doing just about everything. The M5 chip also includes a new 10-core GPU, with better support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, \"enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control,\" according to Apple. The company also says the M5 Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on its micro-OLED displays, which should make everything look a bit sharper. The M5 Vision Pro should last a bit longer than the original model, as well. Apple claims it supports up to two and a half hours of typical usage, and up to three hours of video playback. The previous model was rated for two hours of general usage and two and a half hours of video viewing. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a few days ago that Apple was due for another wave of product announcements. He wrote back then that the new iPad Pro and Vision Pro are already being mass produced and that Apple is \"gearing up for an imminent release.\" Apple had originally wanted to launch a a lighter and cheaper version of the Vision Pro headset, as well, but it reportedly decided to shift its focus on the development of smart glasses.

          "standfirst": "Apple's latest 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros have arrived, and though they're the first with the company's all-new M5 chip, they're otherwise largely identical to last year's models. The main reason to buy one, then, would be for the extra performance over the M4 — something that may be worthwhile to content creators and other power users looking for a tablet instead of a laptop. Last year Apple decided to debut its M4 chip with the iPad Pro lineup and not its laptops. The reason? Only the entry-level M4 was ready (and not the M4 Pro and M4 Max), so Apple decided to wait before putting in its MacBooks so it could launch the entire lineup at once. With updated Magic Keyboards, It also showed that Apple was marketing the iPad Pro as a feasible MacBook replacement for power users. The same applies with the M5, except this time the company also launched its entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro at the same time. As before, the new M5 processor uses TSMC's 3-nanometer process, as Apple reportedly decided against 2-nanometer chips due to cost considerations. The entry-level M5 comes in a couple of versions. The iPad Pro with either 256GB or 512GB of storage gets an M5 with a 9-core CPU (3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores), 10-core GPU and 12GB of RAM. The 1TB and 2TB models get a fourth performance core and 16GB of RAM. The big upgrade here appears to be to the GPU; Apple says each of the 10 GPU cores have a Neural Accelerator on board, which will allow GPU-based AI processing to run significantly faster than on the M4. Apple claims it has more than four times the peak GPU compute performance of the M4 (which is only about 18 months old, mind you). Graphics performance should be about 45 percent higher than on the M4, as well. Overall multithreaded performance is 15 percent faster than the M4, and Apple says that video transcoding is six times faster than what the old M1 iPad Pro from 2021 delivered. As for battery life, Apple claims the same 10 hours that basically every iPad has ever been rated at. But for the first time, the iPad Pro supports fast charging — you can get up to 50 percent in 30 minutes using a 60W USB-C power adaptor. Apple is also using the C1X modem that it originally introduced last month in the iPhone Air; that'll provide the optional 5G service that Apple has offered on iPads for a few years now. There's also an N1 chip (also found in the iPhone Air), which is an Apple-designed networking chip for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread connectivity. Apple claims this new chip will make features like Personal Hotspot and Airdrop more reliable while also offering improved performance on 5GHz Wi-Fi networks. As before, the 2025 iPad Airs are extremely thin and light. The 11-inch model is 5.3mm thick and tips the scales at just under one pound, while the 13-incher is just 5.1mm thick weighs 1.29 pounds. Both feature \"tandem\" OLED Ultra Display XDR screens that hit up to 1,000 nits brightness and peak at 1,600 nits — so they're perfect for viewing and editing HDR content. The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model with 256GB of storage ($1,199 with 5G) and $1,299 for the 13-inch ($1,499 with 5G). Those are the same prices as last year — still extremely expensive, but at least not more than before. You can pre-order the new iPad Pro now, and it'll be available on October 22.

          "title": "ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X review: An extra life for Xbox",
          "standfirst": "Xbox is at a crossroads. While the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 continue to gain popularity, multiple price hikes for the Xbox Series S and X have killed their momentum. And with several big box retailers like Costco deciding to drop Microsoft’s console from their shelves, the current-gen Xbox may be dead in the water. So what should the company do? Microsoft’s most straightforward option would be to simply punt the end of the Xbox's lifecycle, regroup and come back strong with a brand new console in a year or two. On the flipside, the company could follow in Sega's footsteps after the untimely demise of the Dreamcast and become a cross-platform game publisher with a large stable of first-party studios. However, there's a third route that could fill the gap between now and whenever the next Xbox arrives that could potentially expand its reach to a whole new segment: Give handheld gaming a go. Engineering and building a new portable gaming device isn't cheap or quick. So instead of doing everything itself, Microsoft teamed up with ASUS to create the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X — a pair of Windows 11-based portable gaming PCs enhanced with Microsoft's DNA. And while it's too early to say if these handhelds will help save Xbox itself, they're more than solid portables that could have a big impact on portable gaming going forward. Editor's note: This review is focused on the ROG Xbox Ally X, primarily because that's all we have at the moment. However, the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share many features including the same basic design , display, button layout and software (the only difference is their color). That said, the base Xbox Ally has less impressive specs as it comes with a slower AMD Ryzen Z2 chip, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a smaller 60WHr battery. It’s also a touch lighter (1.48 pounds vs 1.58) and has a lower price of $600 instead of $1,000. Design and display: The Xbox goes portable Sam Rutherford for Engadget When you look at the ROG Xbox Ally X, it might appear as if ASUS bolted larger grips to its previous handheld — the Ally X — and called it a day. However, the company says the Xbox Ally was redesigned from the ground up, in large part to include a number of signature features that will make Xbox faithful feel right at home. This includes things like the classic ABXY button layout, Impulse triggers with tons of travel and, of course, the requisite Xbox home button. Then smack dab in the middle of everything is a 7-inch IPS LCD screen. Speaking of the display, ASUS picked a FHD IPS panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that appears to be the exact same screen used on the Ally X. While it doesn't deliver pure blacks like you'd get from OLED, contrast was still surprisingly good. With a brightness of 500 nits (the one on our review unit was actually a touch higher at 510 nits), this display delivers almost everything you want without feeling like you need to upgrade to something like the huge 8.8-inch OLED panel on the Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Around back, there are two customizable paddles while the top edge houses a fingerprint reader and all of the Xbox Ally X's connectivity: two USB-C ports, a microSD card reader and 3.5mm audio. Notably, while both ports support charging and display capabilities, the one furthest to the left is also Thunderbolt 4 compliant. This means it has enough bandwidth to support external GPUs like ASUS' recently updated XG Mobile graphics dock. Ultimately, the ROG Xbox Ally might not look all that different from ASUS' previous handhelds, but between its buttons, triggers and those big new grips, it really does feel like you're holding a portable version of Microsoft's console. Even without Hall Effect sensors, the Xbox Ally X's joysticks are tight and responsive, while the triggers offer a ton of travel. The only thing I wish ASUS and Microsoft had paid a little more attention to is the handheld's haptics, which are fine, but they’re a far cry from the expressive rumble motors you get from a DualSense controller or the Switch 2's Joy-Con. Performance: Flagship handheld power Sam Rutherford for Engadget As the higher-end model in ASUS and Microsoft's new joint handheld lineup, the ROG Xbox Ally X features a AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip with 24GB of memory (which is shared with its GPU) and 1TB of storage that can be expanded via microSD. However, thanks in part to the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft tweaked a number of the handheld's background processes and services for the first time on a Windows 11-based handheld. The result is a slightly more optimized device even when compared to its closest rivals. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 1,920 x 1,080, medium graphics and FSR set to performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X hit 62.1 fps while plugged in and set to its max 35-watt Turbo mode. That's almost five fps higher than what we got from the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (57.5 fps) when its settings are similarly maxed out. Admittedly, this might not sound like a huge improvement, but it ends up being an extra seven percent performance from the same chip, which ain't bad. Meanwhile in Returnal, I got similar numbers after switching to the Ally's more energy-efficient 17-watt Performance Mode (unplugged), where it produced 42 fps at full HD on medium versus 39 fps for the Lenovo. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, it's important to note that the Ally's performance changes depending on whether it's plugged into the wall or not. If you want its full 35-watt Turbo Mode, you're going to need to use a power adapter, while its 17-watt Performance and 13-watt Silent modes stay the same no matter what you do. There’s also a manual performance customization tool, but to access it, you'll need to switch over to ASUS' Armoury Crate app, as there isn't a place to change things directly inside the Xbox app. Software: The tailored gaming experience we needed Getting excited about the software on a gaming handheld is usually pretty difficult. However, between the aforementioned tweaks to background services and the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft has managed to remove a ton of the clunkiness that typically plagues other Windows-based gaming handhelds. Instead of having to wade your way through the traditional Windows desktop before booting into a game, now you're greeted by the Xbox app upon startup (and even during initial setup), so there are fewer steps to get between you and your favorite title. Furthermore, Microsoft has come up with a revamped layout that makes core features super easy to find. The Home tab is where all your installed software is, while there are other dedicated sections for Game Pass downloads (assuming you have a subscription) cloud gaming/remote play (also via Game Pass) and the Microsoft Store. If you prefer other digital marketplaces like Steam or Epic, there are shortcuts to download installers for those stores (and a few more like GOG and Ubisoft) in the My Apps tab. You don't need to open a web browser and do things manually. To switch between apps in Microsoft's new full-screen Xbox experience, all you need to do is swipe up from the bottom of the ROG Xbox Ally X's screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Furthermore, hitting the Xbox button summons a handful of quick settings for all sorts of things, including the Command Center for performance, toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, your Xbox friends list and a whole lot more. It's kind of like a do-everything button and it makes accessing almost all of your most important tools and features quick and easy. On top of that, there are new gestures that you can access by swiping in on the screen in different directions. Dragging your finger in from the left calls up the Xbox Game Bar overlay, even when you're in the middle of playing a game, while swiping in from the right opens your Windows notifications. But my favorite command is swiping up from the bottom, which is a new way to switch between apps (or a cooler version of Alt + Tab, depending on how you look at it). From there, you can even scroll through any programs that are currently open just by tapping the Xbox Ally's shoulder buttons. If you want to use the handheld like a real PC, you can also activate the Windows desktop from there too. Microsoft has also thoughtfully included compatibility tags on a number of games in its store to give buyers a sense of how well a game will run on the ROG Xbox Ally X. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The redesigned Xbox experience is very breezy and handles 90 to 95 percent of your traditional gaming functions, but there are still times when some of Window's underlying awkwardness shows through. Most often, I found this happens when exiting a game from a third-party store, where the Xbox Ally will spit you out into your Steam library (for example), where you'll often have to rely on touchscreen controls instead of the joysticks or the desktop mode's mouse cursor to navigate around. It's not a big deal compared to other Windows-based handhelds, and even though Microsoft has taken a big step forward on the Xbox Ally, there is still a little polishing to be done. Battery life: A solid jump in longevity One of the biggest benefits of going with the ROG Xbox Ally X is that it comes with a larger 80WHr battery than the base model (60Whr). When that is combined with improved energy efficiency from its new chip, you get very solid battery life — just as long as you don’t max out the power settings. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I tested this by playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at full HD on medium settings and max brightness (Protip: don’t do this at night if you want to get to sleep on time) and the Xbox Ally X lasted just shy of three and a half hours. That’s 30 minutes longer than what I got from the Legion Go 2, although considering the latter has a much larger screen (with the same 500 nits of brightness), that difference wasn’t a big shock. The bigger revelation is that when compared to the original Ally X, ASUS and Microsoft’s new jointly-made device provided an extra hour of runtime, which could make a meaningful difference on a long trip. Wrap-up While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements. The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here. Sure, there are still a few edge cases where you’ll have to tap the screen or flip between the Xbox app and ASUS’ Armoury Create to tweak certain settings, but compared to most of its rivals, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a massive upgrade in general usability. Here is a size comparison between the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (bottom) and the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (top). Sam Rutherford for Engadget The bigger grips and a familiar button layout will instantly make longtime Xbox fans feel right at home. And thanks to the new chip and more processes and services that run in the background while you’re gaming, you get class-leading performance and battery life. Aside from lackluster haptics, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s biggest issue is its price. I totally get that there’s a growing number of gamers who constantly crave better performance from their portable PCs. However, the trade-off for all this is a much bigger hit to your wallet. It wasn’t that long ago when the going rate for a premium handheld was more like $500, which made it easier to afford. After all, those devices weren’t really designed to be your main gaming rig like a laptop or desktop. Ultimately the biggest deciding factor for purchasing the ROG Xbox Ally X may be how much someone is already invested into the Xbox ecosystem. If you’re a fan of other game stores or you don’t have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass or a ton of friends on the platform, you won’t get the full benefit of everything Microsoft has integrated into the handheld’s new software. This goes double for devotees of Valve’s digital store and Linux-based OS that don’t need bleeding edge performance, who can safely stick to much more affordable Steam Decks or the Legion Go S. Alternatively, if you want a versatile portable with a giant OLED screen and detachable controllers, the Legion Go 2 is worth consideration as well. Though at $1,300 for the model with a Z2 Extreme chip, it’s even more expensive than this new handheld Xbox. Still, despite some minor caveats, Microsoft has finally put its spin on portable PC gaming (with an assist from ASUS) and brought some welcome upgrades to the space that have made the ROG Xbox Ally X a top shelf device.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html?src=rss",

If you prefer other digital marketplaces like Steam or Epic, there are shortcuts to download installers for those stores (and a few more like GOG and Ubisoft) in the My Apps tab. You don't need to open a web browser and do things manually. To switch between apps in Microsoft's new full-screen Xbox experience, all you need to do is swipe up from the bottom of the ROG Xbox Ally X's screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Furthermore, hitting the Xbox button summons a handful of quick settings for all sorts of things, including the Command Center for performance, toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, your Xbox friends list and a whole lot more. It's kind of like a do-everything button and it makes accessing almost all of your most important tools and features quick and easy. On top of that, there are new gestures that you can access by swiping in on the screen in different directions. Dragging your finger in from the left calls up the Xbox Game Bar overlay, even when you're in the middle of playing a game, while swiping in from the right opens your Windows notifications. But my favorite command is swiping up from the bottom, which is a new way to switch between apps (or a cooler version of Alt + Tab, depending on how you look at it). From there, you can even scroll through any programs that are currently open just by tapping the Xbox Ally's shoulder buttons. If you want to use the handheld like a real PC, you can also activate the Windows desktop from there too. Microsoft has also thoughtfully included compatibility tags on a number of games in its store to give buyers a sense of how well a game will run on the ROG Xbox Ally X. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The redesigned Xbox experience is very breezy and handles 90 to 95 percent of your traditional gaming functions, but there are still times when some of Window's underlying awkwardness shows through. Most often, I found this happens when exiting a game from a third-party store, where the Xbox Ally will spit you out into your Steam library (for example), where you'll often have to rely on touchscreen controls instead of the joysticks or the desktop mode's mouse cursor to navigate around. It's not a big deal compared to other Windows-based handhelds, and even though Microsoft has taken a big step forward on the Xbox Ally, there is still a little polishing to be done. Battery life: A solid jump in longevity One of the biggest benefits of going with the ROG Xbox Ally X is that it comes with a larger 80WHr battery than the base model (60Whr). When that is combined with improved energy efficiency from its new chip, you get very solid battery life — just as long as you don’t max out the power settings. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I tested this by playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at full HD on medium settings and max brightness (Protip: don’t do this at night if you want to get to sleep on time) and the Xbox Ally X lasted just shy of three and a half hours. That’s 30 minutes longer than what I got from the Legion Go 2, although considering the latter has a much larger screen (with the same 500 nits of brightness), that difference wasn’t a big shock. The bigger revelation is that when compared to the original Ally X, ASUS and Microsoft’s new jointly-made device provided an extra hour of runtime, which could make a meaningful difference on a long trip. Wrap-up While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements. The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here. Sure, there are still a few edge cases where you’ll have to tap the screen or flip between the Xbox app and ASUS’ Armoury Create to tweak certain settings, but compared to most of its rivals, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a massive upgrade in general usability. Here is a size comparison between the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (bottom) and the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (top). Sam Rutherford for Engadget The bigger grips and a familiar button layout will instantly make longtime Xbox fans feel right at home. And thanks to the new chip and more processes and services that run in the background while you’re gaming, you get class-leading performance and battery life. Aside from lackluster haptics, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s biggest issue is its price. I totally get that there’s a growing number of gamers who constantly crave better performance from their portable PCs. However, the trade-off for all this is a much bigger hit to your wallet. It wasn’t that long ago when the going rate for a premium handheld was more like $500, which made it easier to afford. After all, those devices weren’t really designed to be your main gaming rig like a laptop or desktop. Ultimately the biggest deciding factor for purchasing the ROG Xbox Ally X may be how much someone is already invested into the Xbox ecosystem. If you’re a fan of other game stores or you don’t have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass or a ton of friends on the platform, you won’t get the full benefit of everything Microsoft has integrated into the handheld’s new software. This goes double for devotees of Valve’s digital store and Linux-based OS that don’t need bleeding edge performance, who can safely stick to much more affordable Steam Decks or the Legion Go S. Alternatively, if you want a versatile portable with a giant OLED screen and detachable controllers, the Legion Go 2 is worth consideration as well. Though at $1,300 for the model with a Z2 Extreme chip, it’s even more expensive than this new handheld Xbox. Still, despite some minor caveats, Microsoft has finally put its spin on portable PC gaming (with an assist from ASUS) and brought some welcome upgrades to the space that have made the ROG Xbox Ally X a top shelf device.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Every now and then, you review a product you can’t get along with in any way, shape or form. Sometimes, it’s about the quality of the hardware, but more often it’s about the philosophy of its makers. Imagine trying to review a toilet built by, and for, aliens from the planet Zog: You can appreciate the intention behind it, but you’ll never be able to praise it. That’s the issue I’ve had with Halliday’s smart glasses, because almost every design decision made by its creators feels, to me, like the wrong one. Cofounder Carter Hou conceded that some people love Halliday’s approach and others haven’t taken to it anywhere near as much. Sadly, I’ve found myself in the latter category. Halliday announced itself to the world at CES in January, dragging behind it a truckload of promises about its Wayfarer-style smart glasses. It said the glasses would be “invisible to onlookers,” styled to be as close to a regular pair of specs as it could manage. There’d be no outward facing camera or sensors, just a tiny interior display projecting data into the wearer’s view. It talked up its “proactive” AI assistant that was always listening and would pipe up with an answer when asked a question. It would be discreetly controlled with a touchpad ring, so you’d not need to visibly fiddle with your phone or the glasses’ touch-sensitive arm to use it. Plus, it would weigh just 35 grams. What’s not to like? The company launched a Kickstarter at the end of January, earning $3,305,917 from more than 8,000 backers. The company has already shared its first product with backers, and it’s now ready to share it with retail customers. I’ve been testing the hardware for around a month with regular software updates. Halliday assured me that the last few issues, like inconsistent Bluetooth connectivity, should be ironed out by the time it’s available to the masses. Hardware Halliday’s chunky Wayfarer-style glasses are made out of plastic, with thin plastic lenses set to your prescription. Plastic is obviously easy to work with and affordable, but it also can give the appearance and feel of looking a bit cheap and flimsy. Even the temple tips are made of solid plastic, which means they can’t be adjusted to suit your head shape and comfort levels.The only way to modify how they sit on your face is by contorting the nose pads, which you’ll be told to do during setup. On the underside of the right temple tip, you’ll find a rubber gasket covering its built-in USB-C charging port. Follow it towards the front and you’ll find one of two speakers (its twin sits on the opposite arm), the touch surface for control and the power button. Sitting over the right lens is a little plastic cantilever arm, on the end of which is a 3.6mm round microLED display module. The arm can be pulled in or out and tilted up and down to put the display into your peripheral vision. The aim, as stated, was to make a small and light pair of glasses that wouldn’t draw attention to themselves. Sadly, Halliday couldn’t avoid the issue that plagues all smart glasses, which is that they have to be bigger to accommodate all the electronics. But, to my eye, they only just about register as a bold style choice rather than as a comically-oversized pair of specs. I keep flip-flopping on this: Half the time, they’re bold, half the time, I feel like I’m wearing faux Marx-brothers glasses from a Halloween store. Daniel Cooper for Engadget The control ring is available in US sizes 8-15, and is made of silver plastic with a small clickpad section embedded. Continuing Halliday’s focus on subtlety, the ring’s only distinguishing mark is a small black line on one side of the clickpad to indicate the right hand side. Slide the ring on without remembering to check its orientation and you’ll be trying to use the menus upside down and back to front. Like a lot of smart rings, it’ll certainly stand out on your hand if you’re used to thinner, daintier adornments.

Like a lot of smart rings, it’ll certainly stand out on your hand if you’re used to thinner, daintier adornments. Display Closeup image of the Halliday Smart Glasses display Daniel Cooper for Engadget It’s easy enough to put a teeny-tiny display close to your eye, ostensibly tricking it into thinking it's much larger. The 3.6mm microLED module is meant to project the equivalent of a 3.5-inch display into your field of view. It’s the same sort of barebones green monochrome display found in a lot of wearables since green is easy to read and not too power-hungry. Again, the focus on invisibility means you’re meant to flick your eyes toward it, read what you need and flick back before anyone’s really noticed. There are many reasons why this is a smart choice compared to companies using waveguide prisms embedded in the lenses itself. It saves a lot of weight, makes what you’re looking at far more private and cuts down the cost. Since, after all, you can just use cheap regular or prescription lenses in the frame, rather than specialist ones with the built-in prisms. But the use of a tiny-display-close-to-your-eye is a problem if you are already a glasses wearer. After all, the screen is behind the prescription, so it’s not as simple as just glancing or catching it in my peripheral vision. In my experience, I’d get a notification, look up, and then have to wait for my eyes to refocus before I could see what was going on. That’s not a big deal if it’s just the time or an icon telling you there’s a new WhatsApp, but it’s hard to read full sentences of text. Personally, I found the display to be too close and too unnaturally placed for me to comfortably use it. I tried every adjustment possible to make it easier to use, even wearing them in silly ways to no avail. And this gets worse when you’re being asked to engage with the lengthy responses produced by its “Proactive” AI. Reading paragraphs of text on a 3.6mm screen is a one-way ticket to the sort of eye pain you’d normally only experience after downing a pint of ice cream. If you struggle to use those sorts of displays, then you’ll also struggle with the other text-heavy features the glasses offer. Most notably, its “reactive” AI, translation and Cheatsheet — its teleprompter-esque service for presentations. In use Image of the rear temple tips of the Halliday Smart Glasses Daniel Cooper for Engadget Once you’ve followed the YouTube clip guiding you through setup, you’ll control your glasses via Halliday’s app. Set that up, make sure it’s connected, and it’ll be easy enough to run things just with the ring. You’ll need to memorize a cumbersome control scheme, which has to work to overcome its limited inputs. For instance, it’s easy enough to think that a click would be the dominant action, with the tap acting as the secondary one — but it’s the other way around. Initially, I was clicking (which activates the notification center) rather than tapping to access a menu item. That the clickpad is so small means you’ll do a fair bit of scrolling, too. Halliday’s focus on lightness extended beyond what you’d wear on your face, but how much you’d need to carry in your bag on the go. Rather than build a charging case, the USB-C charger is on the temple tip, hidden behind a little rubber gasket. Except, the gasket is very difficult to actually flick out of its recess and often gets pushed further in. It got to the point where I keep a paperclip on hand to flick it out when it’s time to recharge. Close up of the Control Ring and charger for the Halliday Smart Glasses Daniel Cooper for Engadget The control ring is charged magnetically, so you will be carrying around a little dongle and USB-C cable. It’s not much extra weight to carry, but it is yet another thing to deal with. Plus, if you’re in a hurry for power, you’ll need to charge two devices simultaneously rather than just putting both in a charging case. Look, maybe this is a gripe too far, but it feels like Halliday attempted to reduce complexity and, in doing so, made things a hell of a lot fiddlier when it comes to charging. Proactive AI Image of how Halliday pitched its proactive AI. Halliday Halliday pitched its glasses as being the “first” with a “proactive” AI running in the background of your day to offer context-based assistance. In one of the company’s examples, the system is listening to a conversation, enabling its wearer to act like a know-it-all. Certainly, it was this feature that most intrigued me as I’m sure we’ve all hoped for an electronic version of Gary from Veep every now and again. Image of a conversation between me and Halliday's Proactive AI Daniel Cooper for Engadget The Star Trek-esque promise of such a system clashes with its reality, since the proactive AI is just a constantly-running chatbot which treats everything as a prompt. Here’s the app’s own record of a conversation I had in which every line it heard gets its own response. It will even try to respond to the ums, ahs and other non-speech glue that holds speech together, saying that the line “doesn’t contain any factual claims.” And, don’t forget, all of this is being pushed into your peripheral vision for as long as the AI is active. Bear in mind you only have a limited amount of time credits with which to use the AI. So you can’t have it running in the background 24/7, but on this evidence, I’m not sure that you would ever want to. Hou says the company is working on improving this but, at this point, it doesn’t feel like a feature you’d want to use on a regular basis. Reactive AI The glasses’ reactive AI, meanwhile, is in dire need of some sort of help, since it often refused to answer my questions and, when it did, it often got its facts wrong. On September 18, I asked it who the current manager of (Portuguese football team) Benfica was, since it had just hired a new manager. But it told me the name of the old one, who’d been fired on August 31 — which isn’t ideal. Similarly, questions around basic facts concerning geography and science were either met with blank responses or lackluster answers. I know that plenty of AIs aren’t perfect for up-to-the-minute information, but what else would you want to use it for? Audio memo and transcription You can record audio memos through the glasses if you need to express an idea in a hurry. It’s worth noting, however, that the microphone quality is poor. It sounds like the sort of crunchy radio microphone audio you last heard in a live news broadcast from the 1980s. Given how much of the interaction with these glasses is through speech, the poor microphone quality is baffling. Sure, save on weight as much as possible, but not for the thing the glasses need to do one of their most critical jobs. Once recorded, you can then listen back to the memo in the app, and can even ask the system for a transcription. Bafflingly, you can’t just press the button and then go do something else in the app. If you want your words turned into (an approximate) text record, you’ll need to leave that specific pane open while it runs. I found this out after pressing the button a third time and, rather than moving to the next memo to get that transcribed, I was distracted by something on my laptop and then saw the transcript finally appear before my eyes. Music Halliday’s app claims it’s possible to use the glasses’ built-in speakers in place of your wireless headphones. And, yes, it is technically possible to do this, in the same way that it’s technically possible to steer a motorcycle with your feet or carve a block of marble with an iPhone. I’m no audiophile, but if you’re looking for a better listening experience, listening to a broken record player from a mile away with two paper cups and some string is probably better. It’s very much the sort of option you’d go for if you had to listen to something in the direst of emergencies — and then never again. Price and the competition If you opted to back Halliday’s glasses on Kickstarter, you could pick them up for $399. For the rest of us, it will be available to order through the Halliday website for $499, with shipping due to begin at the end of October. It is available in one of three colors: Black, Gradient or Tortoisehell, with prescription lenses included in the price, at least at the time of publication. If you order now, you will also get the control ring for free, but it will eventually cost $69. In terms of rival smart glasses, the closest competitor is likely Brilliant Labs’ Halo, which uses a similar standalone microLED display with the same focus on AI. Given the display option, if you think you’d struggle with Halliday, it’s easy to assume you won’t be happy with these either. Halo will set you back $299, although it’s worth mentioning that it’ll only be sold in limited quantities. One alternative is Rokid’s forthcoming Glasses, which are equipped with the sort of waveguide display lenses I prefer. The company promises it’ll offer real-time translation, a built-in AI assistant and an outward-facing camera. Would-be backers can pick them up for $549 on Kickstarter at present, with a retail price likely closer to $750 when they launch toward the end of this year. But if I was looking for a product that did a lot of what Halliday offered, albeit in a much more polished package, it’d be Even Realities G1. There’s a lot to like about the G1, as it offers a more limited feature set, but one in which things actually work a lot better. The one downside is the price, since you’ll need to fork out $600 for the glasses and another $150 for the lenses. The big tech elephant in the room, of course, is Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses that seem to pay off on the promise of smart glasses’ premise. They’re obviously pricey, retailing for $799, but have all of the gadgets and gizmos you are likely to want and need. It ships with a 600 x 600 full color display in the lens, letting you engage with notifications a lot more like you would if you were using your phone. Wrap-up Close up of the Halliday Smart Glasses ring Daniel Cooper for Engadget My issues with the display certainly didn’t endear Halliday to me. But I think that the product is less than the sum of its parts, both from a hardware and software standpoint. The “proactive” AI is perhaps the biggest disappointment, given it’s just a chatbot responding to every interaction like a prompt. In every facet, the company prioritized things that weren’t worth the effort. What appeared to be a series of great ideas on paper is, in reality, not all that.

I found this out after pressing the button a third time and, rather than moving to the next memo to get that transcribed, I was distracted by something on my laptop and then saw the transcript finally appear before my eyes. Music Halliday’s app claims it’s possible to use the glasses’ built-in speakers in place of your wireless headphones. And, yes, it is technically possible to do this, in the same way that it’s technically possible to steer a motorcycle with your feet or carve a block of marble with an iPhone. I’m no audiophile, but if you’re looking for a better listening experience, listening to a broken record player from a mile away with two paper cups and some string is probably better. It’s very much the sort of option you’d go for if you had to listen to something in the direst of emergencies — and then never again. Price and the competition If you opted to back Halliday’s glasses on Kickstarter, you could pick them up for $399. For the rest of us, it will be available to order through the Halliday website for $499, with shipping due to begin at the end of October. It is available in one of three colors: Black, Gradient or Tortoisehell, with prescription lenses included in the price, at least at the time of publication. If you order now, you will also get the control ring for free, but it will eventually cost $69. In terms of rival smart glasses, the closest competitor is likely Brilliant Labs’ Halo, which uses a similar standalone microLED display with the same focus on AI. Given the display option, if you think you’d struggle with Halliday, it’s easy to assume you won’t be happy with these either. Halo will set you back $299, although it’s worth mentioning that it’ll only be sold in limited quantities. One alternative is Rokid’s forthcoming Glasses, which are equipped with the sort of waveguide display lenses I prefer. The company promises it’ll offer real-time translation, a built-in AI assistant and an outward-facing camera. Would-be backers can pick them up for $549 on Kickstarter at present, with a retail price likely closer to $750 when they launch toward the end of this year. But if I was looking for a product that did a lot of what Halliday offered, albeit in a much more polished package, it’d be Even Realities G1. There’s a lot to like about the G1, as it offers a more limited feature set, but one in which things actually work a lot better. The one downside is the price, since you’ll need to fork out $600 for the glasses and another $150 for the lenses. The big tech elephant in the room, of course, is Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses that seem to pay off on the promise of smart glasses’ premise. They’re obviously pricey, retailing for $799, but have all of the gadgets and gizmos you are likely to want and need. It ships with a 600 x 600 full color display in the lens, letting you engage with notifications a lot more like you would if you were using your phone. Wrap-up Close up of the Halliday Smart Glasses ring Daniel Cooper for Engadget My issues with the display certainly didn’t endear Halliday to me. But I think that the product is less than the sum of its parts, both from a hardware and software standpoint. The “proactive” AI is perhaps the biggest disappointment, given it’s just a chatbot responding to every interaction like a prompt. In every facet, the company prioritized things that weren’t worth the effort. What appeared to be a series of great ideas on paper is, in reality, not all that.

          "standfirst": "You'll get access to Windows 10 a little longer by doing this. (Getty Images) Still running Windows 10 on your PC? Did you know that as of October 14, Microsoft moved the software to its \"end of life\" phase? So while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. The good news is you still have three options to make sure your computer remains secure: You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible. You can buy a new PC that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook). Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year. Option three is pretty easy — and can now be done for free in many cases — so we'll focus on that one here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least. How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer We can question Microsoft's motives for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely. At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen. Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings > System > About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available. Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see \"Administrator\" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings > Your Info.) Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not) If you see an option to upgrade to Windows 11, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates. Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates Sign up for ESU by selecting Update & Security from the Settings menu. Click the \"Enroll Now\" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it). Find out if you need to update your computer. (Screenshot/Engadget) If you're not seeing the \"Enroll now\" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above). By enrolling in Extended Security Updates, you'll have another year before you need to upgrade to Windows 11. (Screenshots/Engadget) Step 5: Choose your upgrade method Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to use your administrator account to get started. Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube) That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with no strings attached.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this \"free\" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe. The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first 5 GB of storage. Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings > OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start. Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says \"Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates.\" Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done. A note: Thanks to YouTube's Explaining Computers channel, where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their full video if you'd like a deeper dive into the process. That's it, you're done! (Until next year) You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are. You did it right if you see this window.

It’s more than possible to find a pair with clean sound, strong noise cancellation and a rich set of features for less than $100. That said, there’s still plenty of junk in the bargain bin, so you need to be careful.If you’re looking to make an audio upgrade on the cheap, we’ve read countless reviews, compared specs and tested a few dozen models ourselves to find the best budget wireless earbuds you can buy. This is a busy market with new options releasing all the time, but you can find our current favorites below. Table of contents Best budget wireless earbuds for 2025 Other budget wireless earbuds we tested Best cheap wireless earbuds: FAQs Recent updates Best budget wireless earbuds for 2025 Other budget wireless earbuds we tested The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy earbuds we’ve put through their paces, not a comprehensive list of everything we’ve ever tried. Skullcandy Method 360 ANC The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC is often available for $100, and at that price it’s worth considering over our picks above. These earphones have an extremely V-shaped sound signature with thunderous bass and noticeably clearer highs than the Soundcore Space A40, along with decent ANC and a bulky yet comfortable design that takes after Bose’s old QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. They technically have a list price of $130, however, which puts them over the $100 limit we have for picks in this guide. Their enormous case and lack of wireless charging don’t help either. You can read our review for a full breakdown. Beats Solo Buds The $80 Beats Solo Buds are comfortable and long-lasting, with an impressive 18 hours of battery life. But they sound a bit flat and are severely lacking in features. There’s no ANC, wear detection or official water-resistance rating, and the included case can’t wirelessly charge the earbuds on its own. You can read our full review for more details. JLab Go Pop ANC The $30 JLab Go Pop ANC is worth a look if you just want a competent pair of wireless earphones for as little money as possible. It’s the cheapest set we’ve tested with active noise cancellation and transparency mode, though neither feature is all that effective. Like the Go Sport+, it also relies on a short USB-C cable tethered to its case to charge. But it actually sounds OK for the price: not particularly wide or detailed, but not harsh either, with decent energy and bass punch. The tiny earpieces fit snugly and isolate a good chunk of background noise passively. They’re also IP55-rated, while the case is similarly compact. There’s no auto-pausing, but you can connect to two devices at once, the touch controls work well and JLab’s app makes it easy to adjust settings. Battery life is alright at six to seven hours, too, though this is another one that’ll get wrecked by the wind if you take a call outside. The JLab Go Pop+ is another option here. It gives up the ANC, IP55 rating and multipoint connectivity, but it costs $5 less and has longer battery life. EarFun Air Pro 4 We liked what we heard from the EarFun Air Pro 4 for about a day or so — then one earbud broke, apparently deciding that it would only play at an extremely low volume from that point on. We’ve seen a few users report the same issue, while others have noted problems with crackling sounds coming out of single earpieces. This pair has received heaps of praise from other outlets, and we generally liked its predecessor, so it may well work for you. But we can’t recommend something that died before we could finish testing it. The Beats Solo Buds. Photo by Billy Steele / Engadget EarFun Free Pro 3 The EarFun Free Pro 3 are totally solid, but the Space A40 gets you superior ANC, longer battery life and a more comfortable design for a lower price these days. EarFun Air 2 Along those lines, the EarFun Air 2 are a good alternative to EarFun’s Free 2S if you’re partial an AirPods-style stem design, but they cost $10 more and aren’t significantly better. Baseus Bowie MA10 The Baseus Bowie MA10 are saddled with a ginormous charging case, a sloppy app and bulky earpieces that we found uncomfortable to wear over time. Baseus Eli Sport 1 The Baseus Eli Sport 1 have a fully open design that wraps around the ear and rests outside of your ear canal entirely. That’s nice for staying alert to the outside world, but it’s less so for getting the most detail out of your music. This is another pair with an oversized case, too. OnePlus Buds 3 The OnePlus Buds 3 have an excited sound and a stylish design in the same vein as the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, and their mic is a bit clearer for phone calls. They fall short of Anker’s pair when it comes to noise cancellation and battery life, however. Skullcandy Dime 3 The Skullcandy Dime 3 deliver a surprisingly neutral sound profile for their dirt-cheap price, so they’re worth considering over the JLab Go Pop ANC if you see them in the $25 range. Like that pair, they can also connect to two devices simultaneously. But their overall battery life is a bit shorter, their call quality is poor and their physical controls are both unintuitive and uncomfortable, since they lead you to push the buds deeper into your ear canals. Skullcandy Smokin' Buds The Skullcandy Smokin’ Buds are another ultra-budget option with a sick name, bro, but they sound harsher in the treble than the JLab Go Pop ANC and offer worse battery life through their charging case. This pair does use tap-based controls, but they can be finicky, and they still aren’t the most straightforward things to operate. Best cheap wireless earbuds: FAQs The JLab Go Pop ANC (left) and EarFun Air Pro 4. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What are the biggest differences between cheaper earbuds and more premium models? A higher price does not guarantee higher quality. We'd take a pair like the Anker Soundcore Space A40 over many alternatives priced well over $100. Broadly speaking, though, the pricier components used by the best wireless earbuds let them put out a more detailed and versatile sound, more powerful active noise cancellation and a more complete list of features like multipoint connectivity, faster pairing, wear detection or wireless charging. They generally feel less flimsy in the hand, and their companion software tends to be less buggy. Battery life may be longer as well. But you have to look at these things on a case-by-case basis: Some earbuds justify their cost, others very much do not. Can you improve the sound of cheap wireless earbuds? Evaluating audio quality is always subjective to some extent — what I find \"bloated,\" you may consider \"fun\" or \"lively.\" In general, if a set of earbuds is tuned poorly or built with cheap materials, you can't magically fix that. However, most new pairs allow you to adjust their EQ curve through software, so you can sculpt the frequency ranges in a way that better suits your tastes, at least somewhat. Also, remember that fit is king: If your in-ear headphones aren't sealed tight enough, they'll inevitably sound less detailed, with weaker bass response and worse isolation from outside noise. Consider trying different ear tips in that case. Can cheap earbuds sound as good as AirPods? A few can, sure! I'd take the top-end AirPods Pro 3 over any of the top picks in this guide, but they are far from unassailable. Meanwhile, the AirPods 4's unsealed design prevents them from pumping out truly deep bass, and I find them to sound a bit veiled in the treble. (They're still a level above the open-back Amazon Echo Buds, though.) The big appeal with AirPods is how tightly they integrate with other Apple devices: You open them with an iPhone and they just work. No other earbuds can replicate that, cheap or otherwise, because Apple uses proprietary tech that prevents competitors from offering the same features. Again, price and advertising budget has little to do with how good a set of earbuds is. (This is a silly question, but we know some casual buyers will inevitably ask it.) Recent updates October 2025: We’ve made a few light edits to ensure our recommendations are still up-to-date. June 2025: We’ve ensured our picks are still accurate and added testing notes on Skullcandy’s Method 360 ANC. April 2025: The JLab Go Sport+ replaces the older JLab Go Air Sport as our “best for workouts” pick. We’ve also added testing notes on the EarFun Air Pro 4 and JLab Go Pop ANC, removing our blurbs for their predecessors along the way. December 2024: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and moved the aging JLab Go Air Pop and EarFun Air Pro 3 from honorable mentions to our “others we tested” section. September 2024: We’ve added notes on a handful of other budget wireless earbuds that we’ve tested but fall short of our top picks, which remain unchanged. June 2024: We’ve checked this guide to ensure that all of our picks are still in stock. Accordingly, we’ve removed the Nothing Ear Stick as an honorable mention, as it no longer appears to be available — though it remains a decent option if you do see it and want an unsealed alternative to the Amazon Echo Buds. We’re also still in the process of testing several other sub-$100 Bluetooth earbuds for a future update.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html?src=rss",

Also, remember that fit is king: If your in-ear headphones aren't sealed tight enough, they'll inevitably sound less detailed, with weaker bass response and worse isolation from outside noise. Consider trying different ear tips in that case. Can cheap earbuds sound as good as AirPods? A few can, sure! I'd take the top-end AirPods Pro 3 over any of the top picks in this guide, but they are far from unassailable. Meanwhile, the AirPods 4's unsealed design prevents them from pumping out truly deep bass, and I find them to sound a bit veiled in the treble. (They're still a level above the open-back Amazon Echo Buds, though.) The big appeal with AirPods is how tightly they integrate with other Apple devices: You open them with an iPhone and they just work. No other earbuds can replicate that, cheap or otherwise, because Apple uses proprietary tech that prevents competitors from offering the same features. Again, price and advertising budget has little to do with how good a set of earbuds is. (This is a silly question, but we know some casual buyers will inevitably ask it.) Recent updates October 2025: We’ve made a few light edits to ensure our recommendations are still up-to-date. June 2025: We’ve ensured our picks are still accurate and added testing notes on Skullcandy’s Method 360 ANC. April 2025: The JLab Go Sport+ replaces the older JLab Go Air Sport as our “best for workouts” pick. We’ve also added testing notes on the EarFun Air Pro 4 and JLab Go Pop ANC, removing our blurbs for their predecessors along the way. December 2024: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and moved the aging JLab Go Air Pop and EarFun Air Pro 3 from honorable mentions to our “others we tested” section. September 2024: We’ve added notes on a handful of other budget wireless earbuds that we’ve tested but fall short of our top picks, which remain unchanged. June 2024: We’ve checked this guide to ensure that all of our picks are still in stock. Accordingly, we’ve removed the Nothing Ear Stick as an honorable mention, as it no longer appears to be available — though it remains a decent option if you do see it and want an unsealed alternative to the Amazon Echo Buds. We’re also still in the process of testing several other sub-$100 Bluetooth earbuds for a future update.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-budget-wireless-earbuds-130028735.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Dfinity launches Caffeine, an AI platform that builds production apps from natural language prompts",
          "standfirst": "The Dfinity Foundation on Wednesday released Caffeine, an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to build and deploy web applications through natural language conversation alone, bypassing traditional coding entirely. The system, which became publicly available today, represents a fundamental departure from existing AI coding assistants by building applications on a specialized decentralized infrastructure designed specifically for autonomous AI development.Unlike GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other \"vibe coding\" tools that help human developers write code faster, Caffeine positions itself as a complete replacement for technical teams. Users describe what they want in plain language, and an ensemble of AI models writes, deploys, and continually updates production-grade applications — with no human intervention in the codebase itself.\"In the future, you as a prospective app owner or service owner… will talk to AI. AI will give you what you want on a URL,\" said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at the Dfinity Foundation, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"You will use that, completely interact productively, and you&#x27;ll just keep talking to AI to evolve what that does. The AI, or an ensemble of AIs, will be your tech team.\"The platform has attracted significant early interest: more than 15,000 alpha users tested Caffeine before its public release, with daily active users representing 26% of those who received access codes — \"early Facebook kind of levels,\" according to Williams. The foundation reports some users spending entire days building applications on the platform, forcing Dfinity to consider usage limits due to underlying AI infrastructure costs.Why Caffeine&#x27;s custom programming language guarantees your data won&#x27;t disappearCaffeine&#x27;s most significant technical claim addresses a problem that has plagued AI-generated code: data loss during application updates. The platform builds applications using Motoko, a programming language developed by Dfinity specifically for AI use, which provides mathematical guarantees that upgrades cannot accidentally delete user data.\"When AI is updating apps and services in production, a mistake cannot lose data. That&#x27;s a guarantee,\" Williams said. \"It&#x27;s not like there are some safeguards to try and stop it losing data. This language framework gives it rails that guarantee if an upgrade, an update to its app&#x27;s underlying logic, would cause data loss, the upgrade fails and the AI just tries again.\"This addresses what Williams characterizes as critical failures in competing platforms. User forums for tools like Lovable and Replit, he notes, frequently report three major problems: applications that become irreparably broken as complexity increases, security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, and mysterious data loss during updates.Traditional tech stacks evolved to meet human developer needs — familiarity with SQL databases, preference for known programming languages, existing skill investments. \"That&#x27;s how the traditional tech stacks evolved. It&#x27;s really evolved to meet human needs,\" Williams explained. \"But in the future, it&#x27;s going to be different. You&#x27;re not going to care how the AI did it. Instead, for you, AI is the tech stack.\"Caffeine&#x27;s architecture reflects this philosophy. Applications run entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a blockchain-based network that Dfinity launched in May 2021 after raising over $100 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. The ICP uses what Dfinity calls \"chain-key cryptography\" to create what Williams describes as \"tamper-proof\" code — applications that are mathematically guaranteed to execute their written logic without interference from traditional cyberattacks.\"The code can&#x27;t be affected by ransomware, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about malware in the same way you do,\" Williams said. \"Configuration errors don&#x27;t result in traditional cyber attacks. That passive traditional cyber attacks isn&#x27;t something you need to worry about.\"How &#x27;orthogonal persistence&#x27; lets AI build apps without managing databasesAt the heart of Caffeine&#x27;s technical approach is a concept called \"orthogonal persistence,\" which fundamentally reimagines how applications store and manage data. In traditional development, programmers must write extensive code to move data between application logic and separate database systems — marshaling data in and out of SQL servers, managing connections, handling synchronization.Motoko eliminates this entirely. Williams demonstrated with a simple example: defining a blog post data type and declaring a variable to store an array of posts requires just two lines of code. \"This declaration is all that&#x27;s necessary to have the blog maintain its list of posts,\" he explained during a presentation on the technology. \"Compare that to traditional IT where in order to persist the blog posts, you&#x27;d have to marshal them in and out of a database server. This is quite literally orders of magnitude more simple.\"This abstraction allows AI to work at a higher conceptual level, focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. \"Logic and data are kind of the same,\" Williams said. \"This is one of the things that enables AI to build far more complicated functionality than it could otherwise do.\"The system also employs what Dfinity calls \"loss-safe data migration.\" When AI needs to modify an application&#x27;s data structure — adding a \"likes\" field to blog posts, for example — it must write migration logic in two passes. The framework automatically verifies that the transformation won&#x27;t result in data loss, refusing to compile or deploy code that could delete information unless explicitly instructed.From million-dollar SaaS contracts to conversational app building in minutesWilliams positions Caffeine as particularly transformative for enterprise IT, where he claims costs could fall to \"1% of what they were before\" while time-to-market shrinks to similar fractions. The platform targets a spectrum from individual creators to large corporations, all of whom currently face either expensive development teams or constraining low-code templates.\"A corporation or government department might want to create a corporate portal or CRM, ERP functionality,\" Williams said, referring to customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. \"They will otherwise have to obtain this by signing up for some incredibly expensive SaaS service where they become locked in, their data gets stuck, and they still have to spend a lot of money on consultants customizing the functionality.\"Applications built through Caffeine are owned entirely by their creators and cannot be shut down by centralized parties — a consequence of running on the decentralized Internet Computer network rather than traditional cloud providers like Amazon Web Services. \"When someone says built on the internet computer, it actually means built on the internet computer,\" Williams emphasized, contrasting this with blockchain projects that merely host tokens while running actual applications on centralized infrastructure.The platform demonstrated this versatility during a July 2025 hackathon in San Francisco, where participants created applications ranging from a \"Will Maker\" tool for generating legal documents, to \"Blue Lens,\" a voice-AI water quality monitoring system, to \"Road Patrol,\" a gamified community reporting app for infrastructure problems. Critically, many of these came from non-technical participants with no coding background.\"I&#x27;m from a non-technical background, I&#x27;m actually a quality assurance professional,\" said the creator of Blue Lens in a video testimonial. \"Through Caffeine I can build something really intuitive and next-gen to the public.\" The application integrated multiple external services — Eleven Labs for voice AI, real-time government water data through retrieval-augmented generation, and Midjourney-generated visual assets — all coordinated through conversational prompts.What separates Caffeine from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and the &#x27;vibe coding&#x27; waveCaffeine enters a crowded market of AI-assisted development tools, but Williams argues the competition isn&#x27;t truly comparable. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and similar tools serve human developers working with traditional technology stacks. Platforms like Replit and Lovable occupy a middle ground, offering \"vibe coding\" that mixes AI generation with human editing.\"If you&#x27;re a Node.js developer, you know you&#x27;re working with the traditional stack, and you might want to do your coding with Copilot or using Claude or using Cursor,\" Williams said. \"That&#x27;s a very different thing to what Caffeine is offering. There&#x27;ll always be cases where you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to hand over the logic of the control system for a new nuclear missile silo to AI. But there&#x27;s going to be these holdout areas, right? And there&#x27;s all the legacy stuff that has to be maintained.\"The key distinction, according to Williams, lies in production readiness. Existing AI coding tools excel at rapid prototyping but stumble when applications grow complex or require guaranteed reliability. Reddit forums for these platforms document users hitting insurmountable walls where applications break irreparably, or where AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities.\"As the demands and the requirements become more complicated, eventually you can hit a limit, and when you hit that limit, not only can you not go any further, but sometimes your app will get broken and there&#x27;s no way of going back to where you were before,\" Williams said. \"That can&#x27;t happen with productive apps, and it also can&#x27;t be the case that you&#x27;re getting hacked and losing data, because once you go hands-free, if you like, and there&#x27;s no tech team, there&#x27;s no technical people involved, who&#x27;s going to run the backups and restore your app?\"The Internet Computer&#x27;s architecture addresses this through Byzantine fault tolerance — even if attackers gain physical control over some network hardware, they cannot corrupt applications or their data. \"This is the beginning of a compute revolution and it&#x27;s also the perfect platform for AI to build on,\" Williams said.Inside the vision: A web that programs itself through natural languageDfinity frames Caffeine within a broader vision it calls the \"self-writing internet,\" where the web literally programs itself through natural language interaction. This represents what Williams describes as a \"seismic shift coming to tech\" — from human developers selecting technology stacks based on their existing skills, to AI selecting optimal implementations invisible to users.\"You don&#x27;t care about whether some human being has learned all of the different platforms and Amazon Web Services or something like that. You don&#x27;t care about that. You just care: Is it secure? Do you get security guarantees? Is it resilient? What&#x27;s the level of resilience?\" Williams said. \"Those are the new parameters.\"The platform demonstrated this during live demonstrations, including at the World Computer Summit 2025 in Zurich. Williams created a talent recruitment application from scratch in under two minutes, then modified it in real-time while the application ran with users already interacting with it. \"You will continue talking to the AI and just keep on refreshing the URL to see the changes,\" he explained.This capability extends to complex scenarios. During demonstrations, Williams showed building a tennis lesson booking system, an e-commerce platform, and an event registration system — all simultaneously, working on multiple applications in parallel. \"We predict that as people get very proficient with Caffeine, they could be working on even 10 apps in parallel,\" he said.The system writes substantial code: a simple personal blog generated 700 lines of code in a couple of minutes. More complex applications can involve thousands of lines across frontend and backend components, all abstracted away from the user who only describes desired functionality.The economics of cloning: How Caffeine&#x27;s app market challenges traditional storesCaffeine&#x27;s economic model differs fundamentally from traditional software-as-a-service platforms. Applications run on the Internet Computer Protocol, which uses a \"reverse gas model\" where developers pay for computation rather than users paying transaction fees. The platform includes an integrated App Market where creators can publish applications for others to clone and adapt — creating what Dfinity envisions as a new economic ecosystem.\"App stores today obviously operate on gatekeeping,\" said Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at Dfinity, during the World Computer Summit. \"That&#x27;s going to erode.\" Rather than purchasing applications, users can clone them and modify them for their own purposes — fundamentally different from Apple&#x27;s App Store or Google Play models.Williams acknowledges that Caffeine itself currently runs on centralized infrastructure, despite building applications on the decentralized Internet Computer. \"Caffeine itself actually is centralized. It uses aspects of the Internet Computer. We want Caffeine itself to run on the Internet Computer in the future, but it&#x27;s not there now,\" he said. The platform leverages commercially available foundation models from companies like Anthropic, whose Claude Sonnet model powers much of Caffeine&#x27;s backend logic.This pragmatic approach reflects Dfinity&#x27;s strategy of using best-in-class AI models while focusing its own development on the specialized infrastructure and programming language designed for AI use. \"These content models have been developed by companies with enormous budgets, absolutely enormous budgets,\" Williams said. \"I don&#x27;t think in the near future we&#x27;ll run AI on the Internet Computer for that reason, unless there&#x27;s a special case.\"A decade in the making: From Ethereum roots to the self-writing internetThe Dfinity Foundation has pursued this vision since Williams began researching decentralized networks in late 2013. After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a \"world computer\"—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.\"By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,\" Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that \"in the future, the tech stack will be AI,\" according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the World Computer Summit in June 2025.One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is OpenChat, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. \"The community is actually controlling the source code updates,\" Williams explained. \"Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.\"The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing aheadThe platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. \"The Web3 industry&#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,\" he said during the World Computer Summit. \"Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.\"The foundation&#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then crashed below $3 in 2023 before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits alleging misleading investors, and Dfinity filed defamation claims against industry critics.Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. \"Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,\" Williams explained.The platform&#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.When five billion smartphone users become developersWilliams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. \"The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,\" he said. \"Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.\"During his World Computer Summit demonstration, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. \"Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,\" he said. \"But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.\"The hackathon results suggest this isn&#x27;t pure hyperbole. A dentist built \"Dental Tracks\" to help patients manage their dental records. A transportation industry professional created \"Road Patrol\" for gamified infrastructure reporting. A frustrated knitting student built \"Skill Sprout,\" a garden-themed app for learning new hobbies, complete with material checklists and step-by-step skill breakdowns—all without writing a single line of code.\"I was learning to knit. I got irritated because I had the wrong materials,\" the creator explained in a video interview. \"I don&#x27;t know how to do the stitches, so I have to individually search, and it&#x27;s really intimidating when you&#x27;re trying to learn something you don&#x27;t—you don&#x27;t even know what you don&#x27;t know.\"Whether Caffeine succeeds depends on factors still unknown: how production applications perform under real-world stress, whether the Internet Computer scales to millions of applications, whether enterprises can overcome their skepticism of blockchain-adjacent technology. But if Williams is right about the fundamental shift — that AI will be the tech stack, not just a tool for human developers — then someone will build what Caffeine promises.The question isn&#x27;t whether the future looks like this. It&#x27;s who gets there first, and whether they can do it without losing everyone&#x27;s data along the way.",

After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a \"world computer\"—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.\"By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,\" Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that \"in the future, the tech stack will be AI,\" according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the World Computer Summit in June 2025.One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is OpenChat, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. \"The community is actually controlling the source code updates,\" Williams explained. \"Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.\"The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing aheadThe platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. \"The Web3 industry&#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,\" he said during the World Computer Summit. \"Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.\"The foundation&#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then crashed below $3 in 2023 before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits alleging misleading investors, and Dfinity filed defamation claims against industry critics.Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. \"Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,\" Williams explained.The platform&#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.When five billion smartphone users become developersWilliams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. \"The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,\" he said. \"Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.\"During his World Computer Summit demonstration, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. \"Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,\" he said. \"But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.\"The hackathon results suggest this isn&#x27;t pure hyperbole. A dentist built \"Dental Tracks\" to help patients manage their dental records. A transportation industry professional created \"Road Patrol\" for gamified infrastructure reporting. A frustrated knitting student built \"Skill Sprout,\" a garden-themed app for learning new hobbies, complete with material checklists and step-by-step skill breakdowns—all without writing a single line of code.\"I was learning to knit. I got irritated because I had the wrong materials,\" the creator explained in a video interview. \"I don&#x27;t know how to do the stitches, so I have to individually search, and it&#x27;s really intimidating when you&#x27;re trying to learn something you don&#x27;t—you don&#x27;t even know what you don&#x27;t know.\"Whether Caffeine succeeds depends on factors still unknown: how production applications perform under real-world stress, whether the Internet Computer scales to millions of applications, whether enterprises can overcome their skepticism of blockchain-adjacent technology. But if Williams is right about the fundamental shift — that AI will be the tech stack, not just a tool for human developers — then someone will build what Caffeine promises.The question isn&#x27;t whether the future looks like this. It&#x27;s who gets there first, and whether they can do it without losing everyone&#x27;s data along the way.",

          "standfirst": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $30 ($40 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $5 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing as of October 21, 2025, accounting for the latest price hike. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$/8month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "standfirst": "2025 was supposed to be the year of \"AI agents,\" according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and other AI industry personnel. And it has been, in many ways, with numerous leading AI model providers such as OpenAI, Google, and even Chinese competitors like Alibaba releasing fine-tuned AI models or applications designed to focus on a narrow set of tasks, such as web search and report writing. But one big hurdle to a future of highly performant, reliable, AI agents remains: getting them to stay on task when the task extends over a number of steps. Third-party benchmark tests show even the most powerful AI models experience higher failure rates the more steps they take to complete a task, and the longer time they spend on it (exceeding hours). A new academic framework called EAGLET proposes a practical and efficient method to improve long-horizon task performance in LLM-based agents — without the need for manual data labeling or retraining. Developed by researchers from Tsinghua University, Peking University, DeepLang AI, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, EAGLET offers a \"global planner\" that can be integrated into existing agent workflows to reduce hallucinations and improve task efficiency.EAGLET is a fine-tuned language model that interprets task instructions — typically provided as prompts by the user or the agent&#x27;s operating environment — and generates a high-level plan for the agent (powered by its own LLM). It does not intervene during execution, but its up-front guidance helps reduce planning errors and improve task completion rates.Addressing the Planning Problem in Long-Horizon AgentsMany LLM-based agents struggle with long-horizon tasks because they rely on reactive, step-by-step reasoning. This approach often leads to trial-and-error behavior, planning hallucinations, and inefficient trajectories. EAGLET tackles this limitation by introducing a global planning module that works alongside the executor agent. Instead of blending planning and action generation in a single model, EAGLET separates them, enabling more coherent, task-level strategies.A Two-Stage Training Pipeline with No Human AnnotationsEAGLET’s planner is trained using a two-stage process that requires no human-written plans or annotations. The first stage involves generating synthetic plans with high-capability LLMs, such as GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think. These plans are then filtered using a novel strategy called homologous consensus filtering, which retains only those that improve task performance for both expert and novice executor agents. In the second stage, a rule-based reinforcement learning process further refines the planner, using a custom-designed reward function to assess how much each plan helps multiple agents succeed.Introducing the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR)One of EAGLET’s key innovations is the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR). This reward measures the value of a generated plan by checking whether it helps both high- and low-capability agents complete tasks more successfully and with fewer steps. It also includes a decay factor to favor shorter, more efficient task trajectories. This approach avoids over-rewarding plans that are only useful to already-competent agents and promotes more generalizable planning guidance.Compatible with Existing Agents and ModelsThe EAGLET planner is designed to be modular and \"plug-and-play,\" meaning it can be inserted into existing agent pipelines without requiring executor retraining. In evaluations, the planner boosted performance across a variety of foundational models, including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and Qwen2.5. It also proved effective regardless of prompting strategy, working well with standard ReAct-style prompts as well as approaches like Reflexion.State-of-the-Art Performance Across BenchmarksEAGLET was tested on three widely used benchmarks for long-horizon agent tasks: ScienceWorld, which simulates scientific experiments in a text-based lab environment; ALFWorld, which tasks agents with completing household activities through natural language in a simulated home setting; and WebShop, which evaluates goal-driven behavior in a realistic online shopping interface.Across all three, executor agents equipped with EAGLET outperformed their non-planning counterparts and other planning baselines, including MPO and KnowAgent. In experiments with the open source Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, EAGLET boosted average performance from 39.5 to 59.4, a +19.9 point gain across tasks. On ScienceWorld unseen scenarios, it raised performance from 42.2 to 61.6. In ALFWorld seen scenarios, EAGLET improved outcomes from 22.9 to 54.3, a more than 2.3× increase in performance.Even stronger gains were seen with more capable models. For instance, GPT-4.1 improved from 75.5 to 82.2 average score with EAGLET, and GPT-5 rose from 84.5 to 88.1, despite already being strong performers. In some benchmarks, performance gains were as high as +11.8 points, such as when combining EAGLET with the ETO executor method on ALFWorld unseen tasks.Compared to other planning baselines like MPO, EAGLET consistently delivered higher task completion rates. For example, on ALFWorld unseen tasks with GPT-4.1, MPO achieved 79.1, while EAGLET scored 83.6—a +4.5 point advantage.Additionally, the paper reports that agents using EAGLET complete tasks in fewer steps on average. With GPT-4.1 as executor, average step count dropped from 13.0 (no planner) to 11.1 (EAGLET). With GPT-5, it dropped from 11.4 to 9.4, supporting the claim of improved execution efficiency.Efficiency Gains in Training and ExecutionCompared to RL-based methods like GiGPO, which can require hundreds of training iterations, EAGLET achieved better or comparable results with roughly one-eighth the training effort. This efficiency also carries over into execution: agents using EAGLET typically needed fewer steps to complete tasks. This translates into reduced inference time and compute cost in production scenarios.No Public Code—YetAs of the version submitted to arXiv, the authors have not released an open-source implementation of EAGLET. It is unclear if or when the code will be released, under what license, or how it will be maintained, which may limit the near-term utility of the framework for enterprise deployment. VentureBeat has reached out to the authors to clarify these points and will update this piece when we hear back.Enterprise Deployment Questions RemainWhile the planner is described as plug-and-play, it remains unclear whether EAGLET can be easily integrated into popular enterprise agent frameworks such as LangChain or AutoGen, or if it requires a custom stack to support plan-execute separation. Similarly, the training setup leverages multiple executor agents, which may be difficult to replicate in enterprise environments with limited model access. VentureBeat has asked the researchers whether the homologous consensus filtering method can be adapted for teams that only have access to one executor model or limited compute resources.EAGLET’s authors report success across model types and sizes, but it is not yet known what the minimal viable model scale is for practical deployment. For example, can enterprise teams use the planner effectively with sub-10B parameter open models in latency-sensitive environments? Additionally, the framework may offer industry-specific value in domains like customer support or IT automation, but it remains to be seen how easily the planner can be fine-tuned or customized for such verticals.Real-Time vs. Pre-Generated PlanningAnother open question is how EAGLET is best deployed in practice. Should the planner operate in real-time alongside executors within a loop, or is it better used offline to pre-generate global plans for known task types? Each approach has implications for latency, cost, and operational complexity. VentureBeat has posed this question to the authors and will report any insights that emerge.Strategic Tradeoffs for Enterprise TeamsFor technical leaders at medium-to-large enterprises, EAGLET represents a compelling proof of concept for improving the reliability and efficiency of LLM agents. But without public tooling or implementation guidelines, the framework still presents a build-versus-wait decision. Enterprises must weigh the potential gains in task performance and efficiency against the costs of reproducing or approximating the training process in-house.Potential Use Cases in Enterprise SettingsFor enterprises developing agentic AI systems—especially in environments requiring stepwise planning, such as IT automation, customer support, or online interactions—EAGLET offers a template for how to incorporate planning without retraining. Its ability to guide both open- and closed-source models, along with its efficient training method, may make it an appealing starting point for teams seeking to improve agent performance with minimal overhead.",

Instead of blending planning and action generation in a single model, EAGLET separates them, enabling more coherent, task-level strategies.A Two-Stage Training Pipeline with No Human AnnotationsEAGLET’s planner is trained using a two-stage process that requires no human-written plans or annotations. The first stage involves generating synthetic plans with high-capability LLMs, such as GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think. These plans are then filtered using a novel strategy called homologous consensus filtering, which retains only those that improve task performance for both expert and novice executor agents. In the second stage, a rule-based reinforcement learning process further refines the planner, using a custom-designed reward function to assess how much each plan helps multiple agents succeed.Introducing the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR)One of EAGLET’s key innovations is the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR). This reward measures the value of a generated plan by checking whether it helps both high- and low-capability agents complete tasks more successfully and with fewer steps. It also includes a decay factor to favor shorter, more efficient task trajectories. This approach avoids over-rewarding plans that are only useful to already-competent agents and promotes more generalizable planning guidance.Compatible with Existing Agents and ModelsThe EAGLET planner is designed to be modular and \"plug-and-play,\" meaning it can be inserted into existing agent pipelines without requiring executor retraining. In evaluations, the planner boosted performance across a variety of foundational models, including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and Qwen2.5. It also proved effective regardless of prompting strategy, working well with standard ReAct-style prompts as well as approaches like Reflexion.State-of-the-Art Performance Across BenchmarksEAGLET was tested on three widely used benchmarks for long-horizon agent tasks: ScienceWorld, which simulates scientific experiments in a text-based lab environment; ALFWorld, which tasks agents with completing household activities through natural language in a simulated home setting; and WebShop, which evaluates goal-driven behavior in a realistic online shopping interface.Across all three, executor agents equipped with EAGLET outperformed their non-planning counterparts and other planning baselines, including MPO and KnowAgent. In experiments with the open source Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, EAGLET boosted average performance from 39.5 to 59.4, a +19.9 point gain across tasks. On ScienceWorld unseen scenarios, it raised performance from 42.2 to 61.6. In ALFWorld seen scenarios, EAGLET improved outcomes from 22.9 to 54.3, a more than 2.3× increase in performance.Even stronger gains were seen with more capable models. For instance, GPT-4.1 improved from 75.5 to 82.2 average score with EAGLET, and GPT-5 rose from 84.5 to 88.1, despite already being strong performers. In some benchmarks, performance gains were as high as +11.8 points, such as when combining EAGLET with the ETO executor method on ALFWorld unseen tasks.Compared to other planning baselines like MPO, EAGLET consistently delivered higher task completion rates. For example, on ALFWorld unseen tasks with GPT-4.1, MPO achieved 79.1, while EAGLET scored 83.6—a +4.5 point advantage.Additionally, the paper reports that agents using EAGLET complete tasks in fewer steps on average. With GPT-4.1 as executor, average step count dropped from 13.0 (no planner) to 11.1 (EAGLET). With GPT-5, it dropped from 11.4 to 9.4, supporting the claim of improved execution efficiency.Efficiency Gains in Training and ExecutionCompared to RL-based methods like GiGPO, which can require hundreds of training iterations, EAGLET achieved better or comparable results with roughly one-eighth the training effort. This efficiency also carries over into execution: agents using EAGLET typically needed fewer steps to complete tasks. This translates into reduced inference time and compute cost in production scenarios.No Public Code—YetAs of the version submitted to arXiv, the authors have not released an open-source implementation of EAGLET. It is unclear if or when the code will be released, under what license, or how it will be maintained, which may limit the near-term utility of the framework for enterprise deployment. VentureBeat has reached out to the authors to clarify these points and will update this piece when we hear back.Enterprise Deployment Questions RemainWhile the planner is described as plug-and-play, it remains unclear whether EAGLET can be easily integrated into popular enterprise agent frameworks such as LangChain or AutoGen, or if it requires a custom stack to support plan-execute separation. Similarly, the training setup leverages multiple executor agents, which may be difficult to replicate in enterprise environments with limited model access. VentureBeat has asked the researchers whether the homologous consensus filtering method can be adapted for teams that only have access to one executor model or limited compute resources.EAGLET’s authors report success across model types and sizes, but it is not yet known what the minimal viable model scale is for practical deployment. For example, can enterprise teams use the planner effectively with sub-10B parameter open models in latency-sensitive environments? Additionally, the framework may offer industry-specific value in domains like customer support or IT automation, but it remains to be seen how easily the planner can be fine-tuned or customized for such verticals.Real-Time vs. Pre-Generated PlanningAnother open question is how EAGLET is best deployed in practice. Should the planner operate in real-time alongside executors within a loop, or is it better used offline to pre-generate global plans for known task types? Each approach has implications for latency, cost, and operational complexity. VentureBeat has posed this question to the authors and will report any insights that emerge.Strategic Tradeoffs for Enterprise TeamsFor technical leaders at medium-to-large enterprises, EAGLET represents a compelling proof of concept for improving the reliability and efficiency of LLM agents. But without public tooling or implementation guidelines, the framework still presents a build-versus-wait decision. Enterprises must weigh the potential gains in task performance and efficiency against the costs of reproducing or approximating the training process in-house.Potential Use Cases in Enterprise SettingsFor enterprises developing agentic AI systems—especially in environments requiring stepwise planning, such as IT automation, customer support, or online interactions—EAGLET offers a template for how to incorporate planning without retraining. Its ability to guide both open- and closed-source models, along with its efficient training method, may make it an appealing starting point for teams seeking to improve agent performance with minimal overhead.",

The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users. If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable. As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called distillation, companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.Read full article Comments",

The image was taken by Zhang You of Yunnan, China. Another of You's photographs placed 15th in this year's contest. “It pays to dive deep into entomology: understanding insects’ behaviors and mastering lighting,\" You said in a statement. \"A standout work blends artistry with scientific rigor, capturing the very essence, energy, and spirit of these creatures.” There was an element of luck in creating his winning image, too. \"I had observed rice weevils in grains before, but never one with its wings spread,\" You said. \"This one was naturally preserved on a windowsill, perhaps in a final attempt to escape. Its tiny size makes manually preparing spread-wing specimens extremely difficult, so encountering it was both serendipitous and inspiring.”Read full article Comments",

F5, a Seattle-based maker of networking software, disclosed the breach on Wednesday. F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years. Unprecedented During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.Read full article Comments",

And if you're worried about the cost of conjuring all these AI videos, Google is also adding a \"Fast\" variant of Veo. Veo made waves when it debuted earlier this year, demonstrating a staggering improvement in AI video quality just a few months after Veo 2's release. It turns out that having all that video on YouTube is very useful for training AI models, so Google is already moving on to Veo 3.1 with a raft of new features. Google says Veo 3.1 offers stronger prompt adherence, which results in better video outputs and fewer wasted compute cycles. Audio, which was a hallmark feature of the Veo 3 release, has reportedly improved, too. Veo 3's text-to-video was limited to 720p landscape output, but there's an ever-increasing volume of vertical video on the Internet. So Veo 3.1 can produce both landscape and portrait 16:9 video.Read full article Comments",

The announcement follows OpenAI's recent hint that it would allow developers to create \"mature\" ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls. Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\" but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot \"less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.\" The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allowing OpenAI to relax restrictions in most cases.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "As if DirecTV doesn't have enough trouble keeping customers, the satellite TV provider's streaming devices will show AI-generated screensaver ads next year, according to an announcement today from partnering ads company Glance. People who use either of DirecTV’s two Gemini streaming devices will start seeing the ads “in early 2026,” per the announcement. DirecTV’s Gemini Air is an Android TV-powered USB device that people can plug into a TV for access to live TV channels, as well as streaming apps. Gemini Air doesn’t require a DirecTV satellite connection, and DirecTV gives all of its Internet customers the device. DirecTV first started selling Gemini devices in 2023, when it launched a separate Gemini set-top box that connects through DirecTV satellite setups. DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices' screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default. When the new screensavers launch, Glance's AI content will show if the TV is idle for 10 minutes, The Verge reported.Read full article Comments",

Today, Apple formally announced the new tablets, and it looks like pretty much everything uncovered by that YouTuber turned out to be accurate. The new iPad Pros, powered by Apple's also-new M5 chip, use the same basic designs as the M4 iPad Pros from last year and are compatible with the same cases and accessories. The new iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model, is available for pre-order today, and ships on October 22. Apple's M5 is similar in composition to the M4—the fully enabled version uses four high-performance CPU cores, six high-efficiency CPU cores, 10 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine. But a memory bandwidth increase, from 120GB/s for the M4 to 153GB/s for the M5, enables a 30 percent improvement in GPU performance and a 45 percent increase to ray-traced graphics performance, according to Apple's estimates. Apple's press release also highlighted improvements to storage performance, with \"up to 2x faster storage read and write speeds.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Apple often releases a smaller second wave of new products in October after the dust settles from its September iPhone announcement, and this year that wave revolves around its brand-new M5 chip. The first Mac to get the new processor will be the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, which the company announced today on its press site alongside a new M5 iPad Pro and an updated version of the Vision Pro headset. But unlike the last couple MacBook Pro refreshes, Apple isn't ready with Pro and Max versions of the M5 for higher-end 14-inch MacBook Pros and 16-inch MacBook Pros. Those models will continue to use the M4 Pro and M4 Max for now, and we probably shouldn't expect an update for them until sometime next year. Aside from the M5, the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro has essentially identical specs to the outgoing M4 version. It has a notched 14-inch screen with ProMotion support and a 3024×1964 resolution, three USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a 12 MP Center Stage webcam. It still weighs 3.4 pounds, and Apple still estimates the battery should last for \"up to 16 hours\" of wireless web browsing and up to 24 hours of video streaming. The main internal difference is an option for a 4TB storage upgrade, which will run you $1,200 if you're upgrading from the base 512GB SSD.Read full article Comments",

The Vision Pro could still eventually lead to a product that ushers in a new age of \"spatial computing.\" But it does seem like Apple is a bit less optimistic about the headset's current form—at least, that's one possible way to read the fact that the second-generation Vision Pro is being announced via press release, rather than as the centerpiece of a product event. The new Vision Pro is available for the same $3,499 as the first model, which will likely continue to limit the headset's appeal outside of a die-hard community of early adopters and curious developers.

With the ROG Xbox Ally, Microsoft has finally made those rumors a reality in the weirdest, most Microsoft way possible. Yes, the $600 ROG Xbox Ally—and its souped-up cousin, the $1,000, ridiculous-mouthful-of-a-name ROG Xbox Ally X, which we tested—are the first official handheld hardware to sport the Xbox brand name. But Microsoft isn’t taking the exclusive-heavy, walled garden software approach that it has been committed to for nearly 25 years of Xbox home consoles. Instead, the ROG Xbox Ally is, at its base, simply a new version of Asus’ Windows-based ROG Ally line with an Xbox-flavored coat of paint. That coat of paint—what Microsoft is calling the Xbox Full-screen Experience (FSE)—represents the company’s belated attempt to streamline the Windows gaming experience to be a bit more console-like in terms of user interface and overall simplicity. While that’s a worthy vision, the execution in these early days is so spotty and riddled with annoyances that it’s hard to recommend over the SteamOS-based competition.Read full article Comments",
