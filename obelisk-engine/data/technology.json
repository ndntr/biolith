          "standfirst": "Each week, we check major retailers looking for notable discounts on iPads. Those deals almost never show up on Apple's own website, but Target, Walmart and, of course, Amazon tend to have at least a few worthy discounts on Apple's slates. We update this list at least once per week and, while we're at it, we add standout discounts on other Apple gear, from the wearable Apple Watch to the portable MacBook. Why all the focus on Apple devices? The company's gear consistently ranks among our top picks for tablets, smartwatches, laptops and more.It's important to note that we're just heading into the Black Friday shopping season (it used to be just one day, but the beast has grown). So the discounts you see now may very well get even better as we get closer to the end of November. And if you don't see something you were hoping for on sale (thinking specifically about the AirPods Pro 3 here), check back. For now, these are the top deals on Apple gear we could find. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (M3, 13-inch) for $699 ($100 off): We loved the previous generation iPad Air. The latest edition has a faster M3 chip, which excelled in our benchmark tests. Overall, we awarded it an 89 in our review and it's currently our top pick for among the iPad family. This is the model with the larger 13-inch screen, which is a little harder to carry and hold, but will give you more real estate for watching shows and playing games. It went as low as $649 multiple times this year, but this is still a decent $100 discount if you're not able to wait for further discounts closer to Black Friday. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $933 ($66 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's already $50 or so off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in the black colorway is down to $933. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $949. Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Note that the discount only applies to certain colors. Also at Walmart. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,246 ($53 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Max, 36GB memory, 1TB storage) for $3,096 ($403 off): If you're looking for a near-top-of-the-line MacBook, here's a configuration to consider. This has the fastest currently available M-series chip (though with the release of the M5 chip, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are no doubt on their way). For now, this is a beast that only professional users are likely to appreciate. And the price tag matches that power. The MacBook Pro is our recommended MacBook for creatives and we gave the 16-inch, M4-series models a 92 in our review. This is within $20 of the lowest price we've seen for this configuration. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. We gave it a 90 in our review. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model soon, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag.

          "content": "Each week, we check major retailers looking for notable discounts on iPads. Those deals almost never show up on Apple's own website, but Target, Walmart and, of course, Amazon tend to have at least a few worthy discounts on Apple's slates. We update this list at least once per week and, while we're at it, we add standout discounts on other Apple gear, from the wearable Apple Watch to the portable MacBook. Why all the focus on Apple devices? The company's gear consistently ranks among our top picks for tablets, smartwatches, laptops and more.It's important to note that we're just heading into the Black Friday shopping season (it used to be just one day, but the beast has grown). So the discounts you see now may very well get even better as we get closer to the end of November. And if you don't see something you were hoping for on sale (thinking specifically about the AirPods Pro 3 here), check back. For now, these are the top deals on Apple gear we could find. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (M3, 13-inch) for $699 ($100 off): We loved the previous generation iPad Air. The latest edition has a faster M3 chip, which excelled in our benchmark tests. Overall, we awarded it an 89 in our review and it's currently our top pick for among the iPad family. This is the model with the larger 13-inch screen, which is a little harder to carry and hold, but will give you more real estate for watching shows and playing games. It went as low as $649 multiple times this year, but this is still a decent $100 discount if you're not able to wait for further discounts closer to Black Friday. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $933 ($66 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's already $50 or so off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in the black colorway is down to $933. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $949. Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Note that the discount only applies to certain colors. Also at Walmart. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,246 ($53 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Max, 36GB memory, 1TB storage) for $3,096 ($403 off): If you're looking for a near-top-of-the-line MacBook, here's a configuration to consider. This has the fastest currently available M-series chip (though with the release of the M5 chip, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are no doubt on their way). For now, this is a beast that only professional users are likely to appreciate. And the price tag matches that power. The MacBook Pro is our recommended MacBook for creatives and we gave the 16-inch, M4-series models a 92 in our review. This is within $20 of the lowest price we've seen for this configuration. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. We gave it a 90 in our review. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model soon, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. The discount linked here is within a dollar of the best deal we've tracked outside of an apparent pricing error on Apple's site. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just need a single tracker, you can grab one for $18 at Amazon.

          "standfirst": "We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was. Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Now that football season is in full swing, live TV streaming is still the best way to catch all possible live matchups, as well as other major and minor sports leagues, linear cable-style channels and local networks. We also tried out a number of free, ad-supported live TV services (FAST) and included our impressions below. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.Editor’s note: Disney’s channels (which include ESPN, ABC and more) are currently dark on YouTube TV. Google’s streaming service has been in similar situations this year, when contract disputes with Paramount, followed by NBCUniversal threatened to remove those respective channels from the service. Eleventh hour negotiations with both companies prevented any interruptions, but this time subscribers to YouTube TV are unable to watch any Disney property. We have suggestions on how to watch the missing stations, as well as what steps to follow to get the $20 credit YouTube TV is offering current subscribers. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service.

          "content": "We tested all the major live TV streaming services and, after comparing the features and costs, we still think they are a better deal than paying for cable or satellite — but the gulf between the options is narrowing. Now that most subscriptions go for more than $80 per month, live TV streaming is not the amazing deal it once was. Still, there’s no contract, the pricing is simpler and you don’t need any special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. Now that football season is in full swing, live TV streaming is still the best way to catch all possible live matchups, as well as other major and minor sports leagues, linear cable-style channels and local networks. We also tried out a number of free, ad-supported live TV services (FAST) and included our impressions below. Here are the best live TV streaming services according to our tests.Editor’s note: Disney’s channels (which include ESPN, ABC and more) are currently dark on YouTube TV. Google’s streaming service has been in similar situations this year, when contract disputes with Paramount, followed by NBCUniversal threatened to remove those respective channels from the service. Eleventh hour negotiations with both companies prevented any interruptions, but this time subscribers to YouTube TV are unable to watch any Disney property. We have suggestions on how to watch the missing stations, as well as what steps to follow to get the $20 credit YouTube TV is offering current subscribers. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ (now just called Apple TV) includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. In 2025, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/early-black-friday-apple-deals-include-a-four-pack-of-airtags-for-65-161756983.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "There is a lot of enterprise data trapped in PDF documents. To be sure, gen AI tools have been able to ingest and analyze PDFs, but accuracy, time and cost have been less than ideal. New technology from Databricks could change that.The company this week detailed its \"ai_parse_document\" technology, now integrated with Databricks&#x27; Agent Bricks platform. The technology addresses a critical bottleneck in enterprise AI adoption: Approximately 80% of enterprise knowledge remains locked in PDFs, reports and diagrams that AI systems struggle to accurately process and understand.\"It&#x27;s a common assumption that parsing PDFs is a solved problem, but in reality, it isn&#x27;t,\" Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, told VentureBeat. \"The challenge isn&#x27;t just that documents are unstructured; it&#x27;s that enterprise PDFs are inherently complex. They mix digital-native content with scanned pages and photos of physical documents, alongside tables, charts and irregular layouts, and most existing tools fail to capture that information accurately.\"The hidden complexity behind document parsingWhile optical character recognition (OCR) has existed for decades, Elsen argues that extracting usable, structured data from real-world enterprise documents remains fundamentally unsolved. Key elements such as tables with merged cells, figure captions and spatial relationships between document elements are routinely dropped or misread by existing tools, making downstream AI applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or business intelligence dashboards unreliable.The typical enterprise workaround has been to stack multiple imperfect tools together: One service for layout detection, another for OCR, a third for table extraction, as well as additional APIs for figure analysis. This approach requires months of custom data engineering and ongoing maintenance as document formats evolve.\"To compensate, teams have had to stack multiple imperfect tools or build extensive custom pipelines, spending months on data engineering instead of innovation,\" Elsen said. \"ai_parse_document solves that by extracting complete, structured data from real-world documents — so organizations can finally trust and query unstructured data directly within Databricks.\"Technical approach: End-to-end training vs. pipeline stackingThere are multiple services in the market today for parsing PDFs, including AWS Textract, Google Document AI and Azure Document Intelligence, among others. Elsen argued that instead of just reading text, the tool uses a system of modern AI components trained to end-to-end to extract structured context with state-of-the-art quality.The function goes beyond basic extraction to capture:Tables preserved exactly as they appear, including merged cells and nested structuresFigures and diagrams with AI-generated captions and descriptionsSpatial metadata and bounding boxes for precise element locationOptional image outputs for multimodal search applicationsAll results are stored directly in the Databricks Unity Catalog as Delta tables, meaning parsed documents become queryable structured data without leaving the Databricks environment. This is a key differentiator from cloud services that require exporting data for processing.\"Through data-centric training and optimized inference, we&#x27;ve achieved 3–5x lower cost while matching or exceeding leading systems like Textract, Document AI and Azure Document Intelligence,\" Elsen said.Early enterprise adoption across manufacturing and industrial sectorsSeveral major enterprises have already deployed ai_parse_document in production with use cases spanning data science workflow optimization, democratization of document processing and RAG application development.For example, Elsen noted that Rockwell Automation uses ai_parse_document to reduce configuration overhead for its data scientists. \"What once required significant setup to support complex solutions is now streamlined, letting their teams spend more time innovating and less time managing infrastructure,\" he said.TE Connectivity, meanwhile, is using ai_parse_document to democratize unstructured data processing.\"Previously, extracting tables, text and metadata from documents required complex, code-heavy workflows,\" Elsen said. \"With Databricks, they’ve condensed all of that into a single SQL function, making advanced document processing accessible to every data team, not just data scientists.\"Emerson Electric is another early adopter. The company is using ai_parse_document for a RAG use case. Elsen explained that by enabling parallel document parsing directly within Delta tables, Emerson has made building RAG applications both fast and simple, all within its existing Databricks environment.The platform integration playWhile Databricks has a long history with open source, the ai_parse_document technology is a proprietary component of the Databricks platform.Unlike standalone document intelligence APIs, ai_parse_document is deeply integrated with Databricks&#x27; Agent Bricks platform, which is a collection of AI functions and orchestration capabilities for building production AI agents. The function works with Databricks&#x27; broader data infrastructure, including:Spark Declarative Pipelines: Provide automatic incremental processing, meaning new documents arriving in SharePoint, S3 or Azure Data Lake Storage are parsed automatically without manual orchestration.Unity Catalog: Governs permissions, audit trails and data lineage for parsed content exactly as it does for structured data. Vector Search: Indexes parsed document elements including text, tables and figures with captions for multimodal RAG applications. AI function chaining: Allows developers to pipe ai_parse_document output directly to ai_extract (entity extraction), ai_classify (document categorization) and ai_summarize (content summarization) within a single SQL query.Multi-Agent Supervisor: Coordinates document-processing agents with other specialized agents for complex workflows.\"Parsing is only the beginning and rarely an end unto itself,\" Elsen said. \"The goal is to allow customers to chain our ai_functions, like ai_extract and ai_classify, together with ai_parse_document to turn their documents into actionable data and insights. We also aim to make it seamless to turn a corpus of documents into a knowledge database for use in RAG or other information retrieval agents.\"What this means for enterprise AI strategyFor enterprises building AI agent systems, it&#x27;s critical to understand how PDF documents are actually used and understood by systems. The Databricks approach sheds new light on an issue that many might have considered to be a solved problem. It challenges existing expectations with a new architecture that could benefit multiple types of workflows. However, this is a platform-specific capability that requires careful evaluation for organizations not already using Databricks.For technical decision-makers evaluating AI agent platforms, the key takeaway is that document intelligence is shifting from a specialized external service to an integrated platform capability.",

Imagine adding ChatGPT as another member of your existing group chats, allowing you to text it as you would one of your friends or family members and have them respond as well, and you&#x27;ll have an idea of the intriguing power and potential of this feature.However, the feature is only available as a limited pilot for now to ChatGPT users in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan (all tiers, including free usage).“Group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a shared space to collaborate and interact with others,” OpenAI wrote in its announcement.This development builds on internal experimentation at OpenAI, where technical staffer Keyan Zhang said in a post on X that OpenAI&#x27;s team initially considered multiplayer ChatGPT to be “a wild, out-of-distribution idea.”According to Zhang, the model’s performance in those early tests demonstrated far more potential than existing interfaces typically allow.The move follows OpenAI investor yet competitor Microsoft&#x27;s update of its Copilot AI assistant to allow group chats last month, as well as Anthropic&#x27;s introduction of shareable context and chat histories from its Claude AI models through its Projects feature introduced summer 2024, though this is not a simultaneous, realtime group chat in the same way. Collaborative functionality integrated into ChatGPTGroup chats function as shared conversational spaces where users can plan events, brainstorm ideas, or collaborate on projects with the added support of ChatGPT. These conversations are distinct from individual chats and are excluded from ChatGPT’s memory system—meaning no data from these group threads is used to train or personalize future interactions.Users can initiate a group chat by selecting the people icon in a new or existing conversation. Adding others creates a copy of the original thread, preserving the source dialogue. Participants can join via a shareable link and are prompted to create a profile with a name, username, and photo. The feature supports 1 to 20 participants per group.Each group chat is listed in a new section of the ChatGPT interface, and users can manage settings like naming the group, adding or removing participants, or muting notifications.Powered by GPT-5.1 with expanded toolsThe new group chat feature runs on GPT-5.1 Auto, a backend setting that chooses the optimal model based on the user’s subscription tier and the prompt.

The feature operates independently of the user’s personalized ChatGPT memory, and no new memories are created from these interactions. Participation requires an invitation link, and members are always able to see who is in a chat or leave at any time.Users under the age of 18 are automatically shielded from sensitive content in group chats. Parents or guardians can disable group chat access altogether via built-in parental controls.Group creators retain special permissions, including immunity from being removed by others.

The company expects to expand access over time and refine the feature based on how early users engage with it.Keyan Zhang’s post suggests that the underlying model capabilities are far ahead of the interfaces users currently interact with. This pilot, in OpenAI’s view, offers a new “container” where more of the model’s latent capacity can be surfaced.“Our models have a lot more room to shine than today’s experiences show, and the current containers only use a fraction of their capabilities,” Zhang said.With this initial pilot focused on a limited set of markets, OpenAI is likely monitoring both usage patterns and cultural fit as it plans for broader deployment. For now, the group chat experiment offers a new way for users to interact with ChatGPT—and with each other—in real time, using a conversational interface that blends productivity and personalization.Developer access: Still unclearOpenAI has not provided any indication that Group Chats will be accessible via the API or SDK. The current rollout is framed strictly within the ChatGPT product environment, with no mention of tool calls, developer hooks, or integration support for programmatic use. This absence of signaling leaves it unclear whether the company views group interaction as a future developer primitive or as a contained UX feature for end users only.For enterprise teams exploring how to replicate multi-user collaboration with generative models, any current implementation would require custom orchestration—such as managing multi-party context and prompts across separate API calls, and handling session state and response merging externally.

Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals.

If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had.

Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

One of the best discounts we're tracking at the moment is on the M4-powered Mac Mini desktop — it's $100 off right now, down from $599 to $499. That applies to the 16GB of RAM/256GB SSD model, and it's pretty close to its all-time-low price. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "standfirst": "Earlier this year, I played Metroid Prime for the first time in at least a decade. Back in 2023, Nintendo released a remastered version of the 2002 classic for the Switch, and I felt like dusting it off once we finally knew Metroid Prime 4: Beyond would arrive this year after about a decade in development. The original Metroid Prime holds up surprisingly well for a 23-year-old game, but there were plenty of times where it showed its age. The platforming often felt overly clunky, as precise control over Samus Aran is not the game’s strong suit. Similarly, dealing with larger hordes of energy-sucking Metroids could get pretty frustrating, again due to a lack of precision. But the main feeling I came away from the game with was excitement over a fully modernized Metroid Prime experience. I’ve been interested in seeing how the lush alien worlds, monstrous enemies and first-person combat would feel on a current console, built with today’s technology and the many improvements that have come to game design since 2002. I finally got a chance to play about 90 minutes of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond last week and nothing I saw diminished my excitement for the series being brought into the current decade — even if the game felt almost too familiar at times.I played two segments of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The first is an opening sequence that Nintendo made available for people to try at the Switch 2 demo experiences earlier this year before the console launched, while the second is a longer slice that takes place on a gorgeous alien planet where it seems the bulk of the game will likely take place. That first segment is the classic “get the player acquainted with the controls” level where Samus flies in to help defend a base under attack. Since I had played the Switch version of Metroid Prime recently, I felt right at home with the controls even though a few buttons were remapped. All of the classic Metroid moves, including charge blasts, the morph ball, the missile cannon, the scanning visor and more are intact here, and I quickly slipped back into the routine of scanning enemies for weak points and blasting away. Right from the jump, the game looks fantastic. There’s an extensive cutscene (at least for a Metroid game) that shows Samus flying in to save the day through a battle-torn base, and everything from the flash of fireball explosions to small details on Samus’s ship give off a level of detail that we simply haven’t seen in a Metroid game before. I was playing the game on the Switch 2, in both handheld mode and hooked up to a TV and it looked great either way. The aforementioned explosions popped nicely in HDR and the frame rate never stuttered in a way that I picked up on. As usual, Nintendo’s art direction is top-notch, but this is the first Metroid Prime game made on a console with some power behind it (remember, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption came out on the original Wii). The game isn’t quite aiming for photorealistic graphics, but it’s closer than almost any other Nintendo game I can think of. The combo of impeccable style and a modern resolution that finally lets the Metroid world shine is thrilling, and I can’t wait to see more variety in the worlds that Samus explores.There’s also a lot more voice chatter than in the original Metroid Prime. As you get dropped into defending the base under attack, plenty of other soldiers recognize Samus, ask for help, tell her where to go and generally praise her for being a badass. It’s a lot more voice work than I’m used to in a Metroid game, and it goes a long way towards making the journey feel less isolated. A screenshot showing the jungle world of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.NintendoThe second area I got to explore looks even better than the somewhat generic base where the game kicks off. It’s a classic Metroid world that mixes natural beauty with a mysterious, alien culture. And, of course, a lot of the nature wants to kill you for invading its territory (or possibly because it is being controlled by outside forces). The big boss of the demo was cut from this cloth: a giant tentacled plant flinging its giant spiked arms at you and firing off poisonous flowers. A classic Metroid battle if ever there was one, albeit one that felt not wildly different from some of the boss battles from Metroid Prime. That said, the scope of the battle felt bigger, due to the size of the arena and how the plant’s tentacles made maneuvering and getting off clear shots a challenge. While the boss clearly had a central body right in the middle of the room, the tentacles made it feel like it was all around me, at all timesThis boss felt like an upscaled but familiar version of ones from past games, and it was far from the only thing that felt familiar. For example, the game still uses save stations scattered throughout the map to save your progress rather than just autosaving at significant points. That’s a throwback I didn’t exactly miss and didn’t expect to see in 2025. Plenty of the music cues and sound effects felt like they could have been lifted straight from other Metroid Prime games, and the basic move set and weapons Samus has early in the game is nearly identical to how you start Metroid Prime. Naturally, something happens where she loses most of those abilities and has to regain them to progress — in the demo, I had to find the Morph Ball power up to move on, just as you do in nearly every Metroid game before. Samus Aran uses her new abilities to unlock a way forward.NintendoAt times, it felt like the game was leaning a bit too heavily on the already-established framework rather than trying something new. But given that I was early in the game, I’m allowing for there to be a lot of unexpected changes to come. And I did get a chance to try out the biggest gameplay change Nintendo has teased thus far (no, not the motorcycle): new psychic abilities. These powers, at least in the demo, are primarily used for solving environmental puzzles, as they provide a new way to interact with various objects and structures. But there’s also a combat component that I needed to use to beat the aforementioned boss. You can charge and fire off a sort of psychic beam — once it leaves your blaster, time slows to nearly a crawl and you can take control of its direction with the analog stick. While fighting the boss, I had to guide the beam around a host of obstacles to hit each of the three tentacles; once I did that, the monster was vulnerable and I could then charge in and blast it with my conventional weapons. You can see some examples of this power in action in the video below.I wish I got a chance to see how these powers would evolve throughout the game, and I’m definitely intrigued to see how they manage to separate the gameplay in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond from the aspects of it that feel merely like an updated version of what came before. And to be honest, I’m not sad the game feels familiar. Plenty of people haven’t experienced the Metroid Prime series before or haven’t played it in more than a decade, and many of the familiar aspects felt like a perfect example of “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it.” And it won’t be long before we can all find out if Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finds a way to really stand out from its predecessors after all this time. The game arrives on December 5 for Switch and Switch 2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/metroid-prime-4-beyond-thrillingly-brings-the-series-into-the-modern-era-140000932.html?src=rss",

The Google TV Streamer is going for just $75 right now — the lowest price we've seen it hit yet. The device normally costs $100. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $90 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 34 percent off, bringing it down to just $85 from its usual price of $130. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation Portal is the rare product that launched as a truly baffling device, but has evolved into something genuinely useful. At first, it could only stream games from your PlayStation 5, it lacked core features for a handheld like Bluetooth audio and it felt a bit overpriced at $200 for such a limited product. Add on the fact that home streaming can be notoriously unreliable, since it depends entirely on your ISP and home networking setup, and the Portal simply didn't make much sense. But in 2024 Sony finally added limited cloud streaming for PS Plus titles, and last week it went even further by letting you stream games you own directly from the cloud. All of a sudden, the PlayStation Portal doesn't seem so crazy after all. It also helps that the Portal is still $200 (or less at Gamestop and other retailers), while the cheapest Digital Edition PlayStation 5 has jumped to $500 (up from $400 at launch). Sure, it's still far from a perfect device, but at least it's more functional and significantly less than the PS5 today. Just be aware you'll need to subscribe to the $18 a month (or $160 a year) PlayStation Plus Premium plan to access the cloud streaming features.While my hardware frustrations with the PlayStation Portal remain (more on those later), I can't deny that it's a genuinely great handheld for streaming games from the cloud. Jumping into Ghost of Yotei typically takes between 15 to 30 seconds, and it often loads directly into the game world if I'm continuing from a recent session. The game also plays smoothly, with no noticeable stuttering or lag, and I can still choose between the graphics-heavy 30 fps modes or the smoother 60 fps performance option. It's far from the ideal way to play Ghost of Yotei, which demands an enormous screen and capable speakers, but it's fine in a pinch.In comparison, using Remote Play to access my PlayStation 5 Pro remains as headache-inducing as it did when the PS Portal launched. The handheld can't consistently wake up the PS5 Pro from standby mode, so I'm forced to turn on the console manually if I ever plan to use the Portal. If my PS5 Pro is on, the Portal can typically connect in around five seconds, and it takes another five to ten seconds to launch Ghost of Yotei. Gameplay is typically smooth via Remote Play, but there's occasional stuttering that can interfere with intense combat sequences. PlayStation Portal playing Ghost of Yotei.Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetMy main issue with the PlayStation Portal at launch was that I simply couldn't trust it. Sometimes it would let me remotely connect to my console with no problems, and sometimes it would simply refuse. I've got a fairly robust Wi-Fi 6 networking setup and AT&T gigabit fiber, so my connectivity shouldn't be much of an issue. But clearly something about my networking configuration doesn't play well with the Portal for Remote Play, even if I connect my PS5 Pro via Ethernet. Strangely enough, the PlayStation Portal is far more reliable at streaming games from servers thousands of miles away than it is remotely connecting to the console a few dozen feet away from me. That just goes to show how far cloud streaming has come — it practically feels like local gameplay now. I suppose that shouldn't be too surprising for Sony, since it's only pumping out 1080p streams. NVIDIA's GeForce Now has proven it's possible to stream PC games in 4K, so long as you have gobs of bandwidth to support it.The best thing I can say about the PlayStation Portal now is that I can finally trust it — up to a point, anyway. I had no trouble signing onto its streaming servers to play Ghost of Yotei and Spider-Man 2 on my home network, and I was also able to stream games while tethering on my phone. But the Portal remains a useless device if you're stuck somewhere without decent internet access. You can forget about using it on a plane, even with fast in-flight Wi-Fi, or at hotels with crummy internet and no cellular reception.Spider-Man 2 on the PlayStation PortalDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetGiven its need for decent connectivity and its clunky design, the PlayStation Portal also remains a terrible gaming option on the go. You'll need to find a large case to fit the Portal's huge controller and delicate display, a combination that really does look like a tablet shoved between Sony's DualSense gamepads. It's simply smarter to travel with the slimmer Switch 2, and I'd argue even the massive Steam Deck is easier to stuff into a backpack. And it’s worth noting you can also use apps on the Steam Deck to Remote Play from your console, and you can install the PlayStation Plus Windows app to stream games from the cloud.I'm also still annoyed that Sony didn't include Bluetooth connectivity in the Portal. If you want wireless audio, you'll either have to use Sony's Pulse Explore earbuds or Pulse Elite headphones. You'll have to plug in a separate Bluetooth receiver if you want to use AirPods or any other wireless headphones. You'll definitely want to invest in some sort of audio solution if you plan to game on the Portal for long sessions, since its tinny speakers simply can't do justice to Ghost of Yotei's immersive soundscape.Not surprisingly, cloud gaming didn’t change the Portal’s battery life much. I still saw between four and five hours of play time (broken into dad-friendly chunks, of course). And if you’re on some sort of marathon session, you can always plug in to charge. Since the Portal isn’t using any local hardware to power games — it’s really just decoding video and pushing data over its network connection — you can also expect more reliable battery life than other handhelds. The Switch 2, for example, could last between two to six hours, depending on what you’re playing.While I still can’t wholeheartedly recommend the PlayStation Portal to every gamer, its latest updates make it a more viable option for PlayStation diehards. Maybe you’ll have better luck with Remote Play than me. And if you’re already a PS Plus subscriber, it’s the easiest way to access Sony’s cloud infrastructure. Or, like Engadget’s Jeff Dunn, it could also be the ideal way to game while you juggle the struggles of being a new parent. At the very least, the Portal is no longer truly baffling, but it’s also still not a Vita 2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-portal-in-2025-from-home-streaming-dud-to-cloud-streaming-star-130000144.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Valve has announced a raft of new hardware, including a new VR headset, Steam Machine and Controller. The devices are all designed to usher in a new era of PC gaming, with Valve’s usual focus on the player. Steam Frame is a slender VR headset that connects wirelessly to your PC and has a built-in battery to rid you of those pesky cables. That focus on freedom extends to the Frame operating as a standalone device, like the Meta Quest. At the same time, the company has revived its long-loved (but not massively successful) Steam Machine. This new model has semi-custom AMD silicon capable of running 4K games at 60 frames per second. Valve says it’s roughly six times as powerful as its portable unit, the Steam Deck. Rounding out the list is the controller, which looks like a Steam Deck with the screen cut out. But it’s not as if that’s a bad thing, especially as it’s got TMR sensors which, while using a different underlying technology, promise the same benefits as a Hall Effect stick. As someone on the not particularly game-y end of the spectrum, I use announcements like this as an exercise to see how excited I would be. To that end, I’m curious how much Valve will charge for this gear when it makes its debut early next year. On one hand, the performance promises laid out here are fairly substantial but, on the other, this is also a company that sells the base model Steam Deck for less than a Switch 2. That said, I would certainly get off the couch if there was a new Half-Life game in the works, and that seems plausible here. Nathan Ingraham is certainly getting his little hopes up that the revival of the Steam Machine might see Valve revive something else too. — Dan Cooper Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox.

Thanks to a streaming benefit for subscribers, you can then sign up for Peacock at no extra cost.

Cord cutting is not nearly as affordable as it used to be, so finding a deal like this is pretty helpful. Walmart+ itself offers myriad additional benefits like early access to Black Friday deals, free shipping on orders over $35, discounts on gas, free online veterinary care and more.

Here are the best power banks you can buy, with picks ranging from small MagSafe packs to massive laptop batteries and everything in between. Table of contents Best power banks for 2025 How we test best power banks What to look for in a portable battery pack Other power banks we tested Power bank FAQs Best power banks for 2025 What to look for in a portable battery pack Battery type Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). Flying with portable batteries You may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after just such a thing happened in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked. Recently, Southwest Airlines was the first in the industry to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category. Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is less efficient than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank. Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the Qi2 wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved. To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points. The MagSafe technology on iPhones were once the only handsets that were Qi2-compatible, but now Google’s Pixelsnap tech brings both the higher speed and magnetic grip to Pixel 10 phones. Samsung may follow up with its own version in future releases. The latest wireless charging standard, Q12 25W, is supported by the new iPhone 17 phones as well as the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. Battery packs that are Qi2 25W-enabled are starting to hit the market as well, and the Ugreen MagFlow was the first on the scene. Ports USB-C ports can deliver faster charges than USB-A ports, and most of the portable chargers we recommend here have Type-C connections. But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind). There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them). As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds. Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along. Design Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Here’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries: MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh) Low capacity (≤10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) InfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh) Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh) Belkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh) Anker Prime 26K 300W (26,250mAh) Biolite Charge 100 Max (25,000mAh) We're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary. For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used a 140W cable from Anker. For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15: 3,349 mAh iPhone 16: 3,561 Galaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air: 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank The Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank combines a 10K battery with a built-in USB-C cable and a pop-up Apple Watch charger. I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful. HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking. Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bank Anker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports. EcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bank I was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered. Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Power bank FAQs What's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery. There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes. Does fast charging actually ruin your battery? Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work. While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged. In short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do. Can you use a power bank for all your devices? That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. Proton VPN is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

          "title": "Baidu unveils proprietary ERNIE 5 beating GPT-5 performance on charts, document understanding and more",
          "standfirst": "Mere hours after OpenAI updated its flagship foundation model GPT-5 to GPT-5.1, promising reduced token usage overall and a more pleasant personality with more preset options, Chinese search giant Baidu unveiled its next-generation foundation model, ERNIE 5.0, alongside a suite of AI product upgrades and strategic international expansions.The goal: to position as a global contender in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.Announced at the company&#x27;s Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary, natively omni-modal model designed to jointly process and generate content across text, images, audio, and video. Unlike Baidu’s recently released ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking, which is open source under an enterprise-friendly and permissive Apache 2.0 license, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary model and is available only via Baidu’s ERNIE Bot website (I needed to select it manuallyu from the model picker dropdown) and the Qianfan cloud platform application programming interface (API) for enterprise customers. Alongside the model launch, Baidu introduced major updates to its digital human platform, no-code tools, and general-purpose AI agents — all targeted at expanding its AI footprint beyond China.The company also introduced ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022, a variant optimized for text-intensive tasks, alongside the general preview model that balances across modalities.Baidu emphasized that ERNIE 5.0 represents a shift in how intelligence is deployed at scale, with CEO Robin Li stating: “When you internalize AI, it becomes a native capability and transforms intelligence from a cost into a source of productivity.”Where ERNIE 5.0 outshines GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 ProERNIE 5.0’s benchmark results suggest that Baidu has achieved parity—or near-parity—with the top Western foundation models across a wide spectrum of tasks. In public benchmark slides shared during the Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 Preview outperformed or matched OpenAI’s GPT-5-High and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro in multimodal reasoning, document understanding, and image-based QA, while also demonstrating strong language modeling and code execution abilities. The company emphasized its ability to handle joint inputs and outputs across modalities, rather than relying on post-hoc modality fusion, which it framed as a technical differentiator.On visual tasks, ERNIE 5.0 achieved leading scores on OCRBench, DocVQA, and ChartQA, three benchmarks that test document recognition, comprehension, and structured data reasoning. Baidu claims the model beat both GPT-5-High and Gemini 2.5 Pro on these document and chart-based benchmarks, areas it describes as core to enterprise applications like automated document processing and financial analysis. In image generation, ERNIE 5.0 tied or exceeded Google’s Veo3 across categories including semantic alignment and image quality, according to Baidu’s internal GenEval-based evaluation. Baidu claimed that the model’s multimodal integration allows it to generate and interpret visual content with greater contextual awareness than models relying on modality-specific encoders.For audio and speech tasks, ERNIE 5.0 demonstrated competitive results on MM-AU and TUT2017 audio understanding benchmarks, as well as question answering from spoken language inputs. Its audio performance, while not as heavily emphasized as vision or text, suggests a broad capability footprint intended to support full-spectrum multimodal applications.In language tasks, the model showed strong results on instruction following, factual question answering, and mathematical reasoning—core areas that define the enterprise utility of large language models. The Preview 1022 variant of ERNIE 5.0, tailored for textual performance, showed even stronger language-specific results in early developer access. While Baidu does not claim broad superiority in general language reasoning, its internal evaluations suggest that ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022 closes the gap with top-tier English-language models and outperforms them in Chinese-language performance.While Baidu did not release full benchmark details or raw scores publicly, its performance positioning suggests a deliberate attempt to frame ERNIE 5.0 not as a niche multimodal system but as a flagship model competitive with the largest closed models in general-purpose reasoning. Where Baidu claims a clear lead is in structured document understanding, visual chart reasoning, and integration of multiple modalities into a single, native modeling architecture. Independent verification of these results remains pending, but the breadth of claimed capabilities positions ERNIE 5.0 as a serious alternative in the multimodal foundation model landscape.Enterprise Pricing StrategyERNIE 5.0 is positioned at the premium end of Baidu’s model pricing structure. The company has released specific pricing for API usage on its Qianfan platform, aligning the cost with other top-tier offerings from Chinese competitors like Alibaba.ModelInput Cost (per 1K tokens)Output Cost (per 1K tokens)SourceERNIE 5.0$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.00011 (¥0.0008)$0.00045 (¥0.0032)QianfanQwen3 (Coder ex.)$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanThe contrast in cost between ERNIE 5.0 and earlier models such as ERNIE 4.5 Turbo underscores Baidu’s strategy to differentiate between high-volume, low-cost models and high-capability models designed for complex tasks and multimodal reasoning.Compared to other U.S. alternatives, it remains mid-range in pricing:ModelInput (/1 M tokens)Output (/1 M tokens)SourceGPT-5.1$1.25$10.00OpenAIERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.11$0.45QianfanClaude Opus 4.1$15.00$75.00Anthropic Gemini 2.5 Pro$1.25 (≤200k) / $2.50 (>200k)$10.00 (≤200k) / $15.00 (>200k)Google Vertex AI PricingGrok 4 (grok-4-0709)$3.00$15.00 xAI APIGlobal Expansion: Products and PlatformsIn tandem with the model release, Baidu is expanding internationally:GenFlow 3.0, now with 20M+ users, is the company’s largest general-purpose AI agent and features enhanced memory and multimodal task handling.Famou, a self-evolving agent capable of dynamically solving complex problems, is now commercially available via invite.MeDo, the international version of Baidu’s no-code builder Miaoda, is live globally via medo.dev.Oreate, a productivity workspace with document, slide, image, video, and podcast support, has reached over 1.2M users worldwide.Baidu’s digital human platform, already rolled out in Brazil, is also part of the global push. According to company data, 83% of livestreamers during this year’s “Double 11” shopping event in China used Baidu’s digital human tech, contributing to a 91% increase in GMV.Meanwhile, Baidu’s autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go has surpassed 17 million rides, operating driverless fleets in 22 cities and claiming the title of the world’s largest robotaxi network.Open-Source Vision-Language Model Garners Industry AttentionTwo days before the flagship ERNIE 5.0 event, Baidu also released an open-source multimodal model under the Apache 2.0 license: ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking. As reported by my colleague Michael Nuñez at VentureBeat, the model activates just 3 billion parameters while maintaining a total of 28 billion, using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficient inference.Key technical innovations include:“Thinking with Images”, which enables dynamic zoom-based visual analysisSupport for chart interpretation, document understanding, visual grounding, and temporal awareness in videoRuntime on a single 80GB GPU, making it accessible to mid-sized organizationsFull compatibility with Transformers, vLLM, and Baidu’s FastDeploy toolkitsThis release adds pressure on closed-source competitors. With Apache 2.0 licensing, ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking becomes a viable foundation model for commercial applications without licensing restrictions — something few high-performing models in this class offer.Community Feedback and Baidu’s ResponseFollowing the launch of ERNIE 5.0, developer and AI evaluator Lisan al Gaib (@scaling01) posted a mixed review on X. While initially impressed by the model’s benchmark performance, they reported a persistent issue where ERNIE 5.0 would repeatedly invoke tools — even when explicitly instructed not to — during SVG generation tasks.“ERNIE 5.0 benchmarks looked insane until I tested it… unfortunately it’s RL braindamaged or they have a serious issue with their chat platform / system prompt,” Lisan wrote.In a matter of hours, Baidu’s developer-focused support account, @ErnieforDevs, responded:“Thanks for the feedback! It’s a known bug — certain syntax can consistently trigger it. We’re working on a fix. You can try rephrasing or changing the prompt to avoid it for now.”The quick turnaround reflects Baidu’s increasing emphasis on developer communication, especially as it courts international users through both proprietary and open-source offerings.Outlook for Baidu and its ERNIE foundational LLM familyBaidu’s ERNIE 5.0 marks a strategic escalation in the global foundation model race. With performance claims that put it on par with the most advanced systems from OpenAI and Google, and a mix of premium pricing and open-access alternatives, Baidu is signaling its ambition to become not just a domestic AI leader, but a credible global infrastructure provider.At a time when enterprise AI users are increasingly demanding multimodal performance, flexible licensing, and deployment efficiency, Baidu’s two-track approach—premium hosted APIs and open-source releases—may broaden its appeal across both corporate and developer communities.Whether the company’s performance claims hold up under third-party testing remains to be seen. But in a landscape shaped by rising costs, model complexity, and compute bottlenecks, ERNIE 5.0 and its supporting ecosystem give Baidu a competitive position in the next wave of AI deployment.",
          "content": "Mere hours after OpenAI updated its flagship foundation model GPT-5 to GPT-5.1, promising reduced token usage overall and a more pleasant personality with more preset options, Chinese search giant Baidu unveiled its next-generation foundation model, ERNIE 5.0, alongside a suite of AI product upgrades and strategic international expansions.The goal: to position as a global contender in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market.Announced at the company&#x27;s Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary, natively omni-modal model designed to jointly process and generate content across text, images, audio, and video. Unlike Baidu’s recently released ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking, which is open source under an enterprise-friendly and permissive Apache 2.0 license, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary model and is available only via Baidu’s ERNIE Bot website (I needed to select it manuallyu from the model picker dropdown) and the Qianfan cloud platform application programming interface (API) for enterprise customers. Alongside the model launch, Baidu introduced major updates to its digital human platform, no-code tools, and general-purpose AI agents — all targeted at expanding its AI footprint beyond China.The company also introduced ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022, a variant optimized for text-intensive tasks, alongside the general preview model that balances across modalities.Baidu emphasized that ERNIE 5.0 represents a shift in how intelligence is deployed at scale, with CEO Robin Li stating: “When you internalize AI, it becomes a native capability and transforms intelligence from a cost into a source of productivity.”Where ERNIE 5.0 outshines GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 ProERNIE 5.0’s benchmark results suggest that Baidu has achieved parity—or near-parity—with the top Western foundation models across a wide spectrum of tasks. In public benchmark slides shared during the Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 Preview outperformed or matched OpenAI’s GPT-5-High and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro in multimodal reasoning, document understanding, and image-based QA, while also demonstrating strong language modeling and code execution abilities. The company emphasized its ability to handle joint inputs and outputs across modalities, rather than relying on post-hoc modality fusion, which it framed as a technical differentiator.On visual tasks, ERNIE 5.0 achieved leading scores on OCRBench, DocVQA, and ChartQA, three benchmarks that test document recognition, comprehension, and structured data reasoning. Baidu claims the model beat both GPT-5-High and Gemini 2.5 Pro on these document and chart-based benchmarks, areas it describes as core to enterprise applications like automated document processing and financial analysis. In image generation, ERNIE 5.0 tied or exceeded Google’s Veo3 across categories including semantic alignment and image quality, according to Baidu’s internal GenEval-based evaluation. Baidu claimed that the model’s multimodal integration allows it to generate and interpret visual content with greater contextual awareness than models relying on modality-specific encoders.For audio and speech tasks, ERNIE 5.0 demonstrated competitive results on MM-AU and TUT2017 audio understanding benchmarks, as well as question answering from spoken language inputs. Its audio performance, while not as heavily emphasized as vision or text, suggests a broad capability footprint intended to support full-spectrum multimodal applications.In language tasks, the model showed strong results on instruction following, factual question answering, and mathematical reasoning—core areas that define the enterprise utility of large language models. The Preview 1022 variant of ERNIE 5.0, tailored for textual performance, showed even stronger language-specific results in early developer access. While Baidu does not claim broad superiority in general language reasoning, its internal evaluations suggest that ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022 closes the gap with top-tier English-language models and outperforms them in Chinese-language performance.While Baidu did not release full benchmark details or raw scores publicly, its performance positioning suggests a deliberate attempt to frame ERNIE 5.0 not as a niche multimodal system but as a flagship model competitive with the largest closed models in general-purpose reasoning. Where Baidu claims a clear lead is in structured document understanding, visual chart reasoning, and integration of multiple modalities into a single, native modeling architecture. Independent verification of these results remains pending, but the breadth of claimed capabilities positions ERNIE 5.0 as a serious alternative in the multimodal foundation model landscape.Enterprise Pricing StrategyERNIE 5.0 is positioned at the premium end of Baidu’s model pricing structure. The company has released specific pricing for API usage on its Qianfan platform, aligning the cost with other top-tier offerings from Chinese competitors like Alibaba.ModelInput Cost (per 1K tokens)Output Cost (per 1K tokens)SourceERNIE 5.0$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.00011 (¥0.0008)$0.00045 (¥0.0032)QianfanQwen3 (Coder ex.)$0.00085 (¥0.006)$0.0034 (¥0.024)QianfanThe contrast in cost between ERNIE 5.0 and earlier models such as ERNIE 4.5 Turbo underscores Baidu’s strategy to differentiate between high-volume, low-cost models and high-capability models designed for complex tasks and multimodal reasoning.Compared to other U.S. alternatives, it remains mid-range in pricing:ModelInput (/1 M tokens)Output (/1 M tokens)SourceGPT-5.1$1.25$10.00OpenAIERNIE 5.0$0.85$3.40QianfanERNIE 4.5 Turbo (ex.)$0.11$0.45QianfanClaude Opus 4.1$15.00$75.00Anthropic Gemini 2.5 Pro$1.25 (≤200k) / $2.50 (>200k)$10.00 (≤200k) / $15.00 (>200k)Google Vertex AI PricingGrok 4 (grok-4-0709)$3.00$15.00 xAI APIGlobal Expansion: Products and PlatformsIn tandem with the model release, Baidu is expanding internationally:GenFlow 3.0, now with 20M+ users, is the company’s largest general-purpose AI agent and features enhanced memory and multimodal task handling.Famou, a self-evolving agent capable of dynamically solving complex problems, is now commercially available via invite.MeDo, the international version of Baidu’s no-code builder Miaoda, is live globally via medo.dev.Oreate, a productivity workspace with document, slide, image, video, and podcast support, has reached over 1.2M users worldwide.Baidu’s digital human platform, already rolled out in Brazil, is also part of the global push. According to company data, 83% of livestreamers during this year’s “Double 11” shopping event in China used Baidu’s digital human tech, contributing to a 91% increase in GMV.Meanwhile, Baidu’s autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go has surpassed 17 million rides, operating driverless fleets in 22 cities and claiming the title of the world’s largest robotaxi network.Open-Source Vision-Language Model Garners Industry AttentionTwo days before the flagship ERNIE 5.0 event, Baidu also released an open-source multimodal model under the Apache 2.0 license: ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking. As reported by my colleague Michael Nuñez at VentureBeat, the model activates just 3 billion parameters while maintaining a total of 28 billion, using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficient inference.Key technical innovations include:“Thinking with Images”, which enables dynamic zoom-based visual analysisSupport for chart interpretation, document understanding, visual grounding, and temporal awareness in videoRuntime on a single 80GB GPU, making it accessible to mid-sized organizationsFull compatibility with Transformers, vLLM, and Baidu’s FastDeploy toolkitsThis release adds pressure on closed-source competitors. With Apache 2.0 licensing, ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking becomes a viable foundation model for commercial applications without licensing restrictions — something few high-performing models in this class offer.Community Feedback and Baidu’s ResponseFollowing the launch of ERNIE 5.0, developer and AI evaluator Lisan al Gaib (@scaling01) posted a mixed review on X. While initially impressed by the model’s benchmark performance, they reported a persistent issue where ERNIE 5.0 would repeatedly invoke tools — even when explicitly instructed not to — during SVG generation tasks.“ERNIE 5.0 benchmarks looked insane until I tested it… unfortunately it’s RL braindamaged or they have a serious issue with their chat platform / system prompt,” Lisan wrote.In a matter of hours, Baidu’s developer-focused support account, @ErnieforDevs, responded:“Thanks for the feedback! It’s a known bug — certain syntax can consistently trigger it. We’re working on a fix. You can try rephrasing or changing the prompt to avoid it for now.”The quick turnaround reflects Baidu’s increasing emphasis on developer communication, especially as it courts international users through both proprietary and open-source offerings.Outlook for Baidu and its ERNIE foundational LLM familyBaidu’s ERNIE 5.0 marks a strategic escalation in the global foundation model race. With performance claims that put it on par with the most advanced systems from OpenAI and Google, and a mix of premium pricing and open-access alternatives, Baidu is signaling its ambition to become not just a domestic AI leader, but a credible global infrastructure provider.At a time when enterprise AI users are increasingly demanding multimodal performance, flexible licensing, and deployment efficiency, Baidu’s two-track approach—premium hosted APIs and open-source releases—may broaden its appeal across both corporate and developer communities.Whether the company’s performance claims hold up under third-party testing remains to be seen.

The possible origins of the term “white elephant” provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less.

Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him.

          "standfirst": "Artificial intelligence agents powered by the world&#x27;s most advanced language models routinely fail to complete even straightforward professional tasks on their own, according to groundbreaking research released Thursday by Upwork, the largest online work marketplace.But the same study reveals a more promising path forward: When AI agents collaborate with human experts, project completion rates surge by up to 70%, suggesting the future of work may not pit humans against machines but rather pair them together in powerful new ways.The findings, drawn from more than 300 real client projects posted to Upwork&#x27;s platform, marking the first systematic evaluation of how human expertise amplifies AI agent performance in actual professional work — not synthetic tests or academic simulations. The research challenges both the hype around fully autonomous AI agents and fears that such technology will imminently replace knowledge workers.\"AI agents aren&#x27;t that agentic, meaning they aren&#x27;t that good,\" Andrew Rabinovich, Upwork&#x27;s chief technology officer and head of AI and machine learning, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"However, when paired with expert human professionals, project completion rates improve dramatically, supporting our firm belief that the future of work will be defined by humans and AI collaborating to get more work done, with human intuition and domain expertise playing a critical role.\"How AI agents performed on 300+ real freelance jobs—and why they struggledUpwork&#x27;s Human+Agent Productivity Index (HAPI) evaluated how three leading AI systems — Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, and Claude Sonnet 4 — performed on actual jobs posted by paying clients across categories including writing, data science, web development, engineering, sales, and translation.Critically, Upwork deliberately selected simple, well-defined projects where AI agents stood a reasonable chance of success. These jobs, priced under $500, represent less than 6% of Upwork&#x27;s total gross services volume — a tiny fraction of the platform&#x27;s overall business and an acknowledgment of current AI limitations.\"The reality is that although we study AI, and I&#x27;ve been doing this for 25 years, and we see significant breakthroughs, the reality is that these agents aren&#x27;t that agentic,\" Rabinovich told VentureBeat. \"So if we go up the value chain, the problems become so much more difficult, then we don&#x27;t think they can solve them at all, even to scratch the surface. So we specifically chose simpler tasks that would give an agent some kind of traction.\"Even on these deliberately simplified tasks, AI agents working independently struggled. But when expert freelancers provided feedback — spending an average of just 20 minutes per review cycle — the agents&#x27; performance improved substantially with each iteration.20 minutes of human feedback boosted AI completion rates up to 70%The research reveals stark differences in how AI agents perform with and without human guidance across different types of work. For data science and analytics projects, Claude Sonnet 4 achieved a 64% completion rate working alone but jumped to 93% after receiving feedback from a human expert. In sales and marketing work, Gemini 2.5 Pro&#x27;s completion rate rose from 17% independently to 31% with human input. OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 showed similarly dramatic improvements in engineering and architecture tasks, climbing from 30% to 50% completion.The pattern held across virtually all categories, with agents responding particularly well to human feedback on qualitative, creative work requiring editorial judgment — areas like writing, translation, and marketing — where completion rates increased by up to 17 percentage points per feedback cycle.The finding challenges a fundamental assumption in the AI industry: that agent benchmarks conducted in isolation accurately predict real-world performance.\"While we show that in the tasks that we have selected for agents to perform in isolation, they perform similarly to the previous results that we&#x27;ve seen published openly, what we&#x27;ve shown is that in collaboration with humans, the performance of these agents improves surprisingly well,\" Rabinovich said. \"It&#x27;s not just a one-turn back and forth, but the more feedback the human provides, the better the agent gets at performing.\"Why ChatGPT can ace the SAT but can&#x27;t count the R&#x27;s in &#x27;strawberry&#x27;The research arrives as the AI industry grapples with a measurement crisis. Traditional benchmarks — standardized tests that AI models can master, sometimes scoring perfectly on SAT exams or mathematics olympiads — have proven poor predictors of real-world capability.\"With advances of large language models, what we&#x27;re now seeing is that these static, academic datasets are completely saturated,\" Rabinovich said. \"So you could get a perfect score in the SAT test or LSAT or any of the math olympiads, and then you would ask ChatGPT how many R&#x27;s there are in the word strawberry, and it would get it wrong.\"This phenomenon — where AI systems ace formal tests but stumble on trivial real-world questions — has led to growing skepticism about AI capabilities, even as companies race to deploy autonomous agents. Several recent benchmarks from other firms have tested AI agents on Upwork jobs, but those evaluations measured only isolated performance, not the collaborative potential that Upwork&#x27;s research reveals.\"We wanted to evaluate the quality of these agents on actual real work with economic value associated with it, and not only see how well these agents do, but also see how these agents do in collaboration with humans, because we sort of knew already that in isolation, they&#x27;re not that advanced,\" Rabinovich explained.For Upwork, which connects roughly 800,000 active clients posting more than 3 million jobs annually to a global pool of freelancers, the research serves a strategic business purpose: establishing quality standards for AI agents before allowing them to compete or collaborate with human workers on its platform.The economics of human-AI teamwork: Why paying for expert feedback still saves moneyDespite requiring multiple rounds of human feedback — each lasting about 20 minutes — the time investment remains \"orders of magnitude different between a human doing the work alone, versus a human doing the work with an AI agent,\" Rabinovich said. Where a project might take a freelancer days to complete independently, the agent-plus-human approach can deliver results in hours through iterative cycles of automated work and expert refinement.The economic implications extend beyond simple time savings. Upwork recently reported that gross services volume from AI-related work grew 53% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, one of the strongest growth drivers for the company. But executives have been careful to frame AI not as a replacement for freelancers but as an enhancement to their capabilities.\"AI was a huge overhang for our valuation,\" Erica Gessert, Upwork&#x27;s CFO, told CFO Brew in October. \"There was this belief that all work was going to go away. AI was going to take it, and especially work that&#x27;s done by people like freelancers, because they are impermanent. Actually, the opposite is true.\"The company&#x27;s strategy centers on enabling freelancers to handle more complex, higher-value work by offloading routine tasks to AI. \"Freelancers actually prefer to have tools that automate the manual labor and repetitive part of their work, and really focus on the creative and conceptual part of the process,\" Rabinovich said.Rather than replacing jobs, he argues, AI will transform them: \"Simpler tasks will be automated by agents, but the jobs will become much more complex in the number of tasks, so the amount of work and therefore earnings for freelancers will actually only go up.\"AI coding agents excel, but creative writing and translation still need humansThe research reveals a clear pattern in agent capabilities. AI systems perform best on \"deterministic and verifiable\" tasks with objectively correct answers, like solving math problems or writing basic code. \"Most coding tasks are very similar to each other,\" Rabinovich noted. \"That&#x27;s why coding agents are becoming so good.\"In Upwork&#x27;s tests, web development, mobile app development, and data science projects — especially those involving structured, computational work — saw the highest standalone agent completion rates. Claude Sonnet 4 completed 68% of web development jobs and 64% of data science projects without human help, while Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 74% on certain technical tasks.But qualitative work proved far more challenging. When asked to create website layouts, write marketing copy, or translate content with appropriate cultural nuance, agents floundered without expert guidance. \"When you ask it to write you a poem, the quality of the poem is extremely subjective,\" Rabinovich said. \"Since the rubrics for evaluation were provided by humans, there&#x27;s some level of variability in representation.\"Writing, translation, and sales and marketing projects showed the most dramatic improvements from human feedback. For writing work, completion rates increased by up to 17 percentage points after expert review. Engineering and architecture projects requiring creative problem-solving — like civil engineering or architectural design — improved by as much as 23 percentage points with human oversight.This pattern suggests AI agents excel at pattern matching and replication but struggle with creativity, judgment, and context — precisely the skills that define higher-value professional work.Inside the research: How Upwork tested AI agents with peer-reviewed scientific methodsUpwork partnered with elite freelancers on its platform to evaluate every deliverable produced by AI agents, both independently and after each cycle of human feedback. These evaluators created detailed rubrics defining whether projects met core requirements specified in job descriptions, then scored outputs across multiple iterations.Importantly, evaluators focused only on objective completion criteria, excluding subjective factors like stylistic preferences or quality judgments that might emerge in actual client relationships. \"Rubric-based completion rates should not be viewed as a measure of whether an agent would be paid in a real marketplace setting,\" the research notes, \"but as an indicator of its ability to fulfill explicitly defined requests.\"This distinction matters: An AI agent might technically complete all specified requirements yet still produce work a client rejects as inadequate. Conversely, subjective client satisfaction — the true measure of marketplace success — remains beyond current measurement capabilities.The research underwent double-blind peer review and was accepted to NeurIPS, the premier academic conference for AI research, where Upwork will present full results in early December. The company plans to publish a complete methodology and make the benchmark available to the research community, updating the task pool regularly to prevent overfitting as agents improve.\"The idea is for this benchmark to be a living and breathing platform where agents can come in and evaluate themselves on all categories of work, and the tasks that will be offered on the platform will always update, so that these agents don&#x27;t overfit and basically memorize the tasks at hand,\" Rabinovich said.Upwork&#x27;s AI strategy: Building Uma, a &#x27;meta-agent&#x27; that manages human and AI workersThe research directly informs Upwork&#x27;s product roadmap as the company positions itself for what executives call \"the age of AI and beyond.\" Rather than building its own AI agents to complete specific tasks, Upwork is developing Uma, a \"meta orchestration agent\" that coordinates between human workers, AI systems, and clients.\"Today, Upwork is a marketplace where clients look for freelancers to get work done, and then talent comes to Upwork to find work,\" Rabinovich explained. \"This is getting expanded into a domain where clients come to Upwork, communicate with Uma, this meta-orchestration agent, and then Uma identifies the necessary talent to get the job done, gets the tasks outcomes completed, and then delivers that to the client.\"In this vision, clients would interact primarily with Uma rather than directly hiring freelancers. The AI system would analyze project requirements, determine which tasks require human expertise versus AI execution, coordinate the workflow, and ensure quality — acting as an intelligent project manager rather than a replacement worker.\"We don&#x27;t want to build agents that actually complete the tasks, but we are building this meta orchestration agent that figures out what human and agent talent is necessary in order to complete the tasks,\" Rabinovich said. \"Uma evaluates the work to be delivered to the client, orchestrates the interaction between humans and agents, and is able to learn from all the interactions that happen on the platform how to break jobs into tasks so that they get completed in a timely and effective manner.\"The company recently announced plans to open its first international office in Lisbon, Portugal, by the fourth quarter of 2026, with a focus on AI infrastructure development and technical hiring. The expansion follows Upwork&#x27;s record-breaking third quarter, driven partly by AI-powered product innovation and strong demand for workers with AI skills.OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google race to build autonomous agents—but reality lags hypeUpwork&#x27;s findings arrive amid escalating competition in the AI agent space. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and numerous startups are racing to develop autonomous agents capable of complex multi-step tasks, from booking travel to analyzing financial data to writing software.But recent high-profile stumbles have tempered initial enthusiasm. AI agents frequently misunderstand instructions, make logical errors, or produce confidently wrong results — a phenomenon researchers call \"hallucination.\" The gap between controlled demonstration videos and reliable real-world performance remains vast.\"There have been some evaluations that came from OpenAI and other platforms where real Upwork tasks were considered for completion by agents, and across the board, the reported results were not very optimistic, in the sense that they showed that agents—even the best ones, meaning powered by most advanced LLMs — can&#x27;t really compete with humans that well, because the completion rates are pretty low,\" Rabinovich said.Rather than waiting for AI to fully mature — a timeline that remains uncertain—Upwork is betting on a hybrid approach that leverages AI&#x27;s strengths (speed, scalability, pattern recognition) while retaining human strengths (judgment, creativity, contextual understanding).This philosophy extends to learning and improvement. Current AI models train primarily on static datasets scraped from the internet, supplemented by human preference feedback. But most professional work is qualitative, making it difficult for AI systems to know whether their outputs are actually good without expert evaluation.\"Unless you have this collaboration between the human and the machine, where the human is kind of the teacher and the machine is the student trying to discover new solutions, none of this will be possible,\" Rabinovich said. \"Upwork is very uniquely positioned to create such an environment because if you try to do this with, say, self-driving cars, and you tell Waymo cars to explore new ways of getting to the airport, like avoiding traffic signs, then a bunch of bad things will happen. In doing work on Upwork, if it creates a wrong website, it doesn&#x27;t cost very much, and there&#x27;s no negative side effects. But the opportunity to learn is absolutely tremendous.\"Will AI take your job? The evidence suggests a more complicated answerWhile much public discourse around AI focuses on job displacement, Rabinovich argues the historical pattern suggests otherwise — though the transition may prove disruptive.\"The narrative in the public is that AI is eliminating jobs, whether it&#x27;s writing, translation, coding or other digital work, but no one really talks about the exponential amount of new types of work that it will create,\" he said. \"When we invented electricity and steam engines and things like that, they certainly replaced certain jobs, but the amount of new jobs that were introduced is exponentially more, and we think the same is going to happen here.\"The research identifies emerging job categories focused on AI oversight: designing effective human-machine workflows, providing high-quality feedback to improve agent performance, and verifying that AI-generated work meets quality standards. These skills—prompt engineering, agent supervision, output verification—barely existed two years ago but now command premium rates on platforms like Upwork.\"New types of skills from humans are becoming necessary in the form of how to design the interaction between humans and machines, how to guide agents to make them better, and ultimately, how to verify that whatever agentic proposals are being made are actually correct, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s necessary in order to advance the state of AI,\" Rabinovich said.The question remains whether this transition— from doing tasks to overseeing them — will create opportunities as quickly as it disrupts existing roles. For freelancers on Upwork, the answer may already be emerging in their bank accounts: The platform saw AI-related work grow 53% year-over-year, even as fears of AI-driven unemployment dominated headlines.",
          "content": "Artificial intelligence agents powered by the world&#x27;s most advanced language models routinely fail to complete even straightforward professional tasks on their own, according to groundbreaking research released Thursday by Upwork, the largest online work marketplace.But the same study reveals a more promising path forward: When AI agents collaborate with human experts, project completion rates surge by up to 70%, suggesting the future of work may not pit humans against machines but rather pair them together in powerful new ways.The findings, drawn from more than 300 real client projects posted to Upwork&#x27;s platform, marking the first systematic evaluation of how human expertise amplifies AI agent performance in actual professional work — not synthetic tests or academic simulations. The research challenges both the hype around fully autonomous AI agents and fears that such technology will imminently replace knowledge workers.\"AI agents aren&#x27;t that agentic, meaning they aren&#x27;t that good,\" Andrew Rabinovich, Upwork&#x27;s chief technology officer and head of AI and machine learning, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"However, when paired with expert human professionals, project completion rates improve dramatically, supporting our firm belief that the future of work will be defined by humans and AI collaborating to get more work done, with human intuition and domain expertise playing a critical role.\"How AI agents performed on 300+ real freelance jobs—and why they struggledUpwork&#x27;s Human+Agent Productivity Index (HAPI) evaluated how three leading AI systems — Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, and Claude Sonnet 4 — performed on actual jobs posted by paying clients across categories including writing, data science, web development, engineering, sales, and translation.Critically, Upwork deliberately selected simple, well-defined projects where AI agents stood a reasonable chance of success. These jobs, priced under $500, represent less than 6% of Upwork&#x27;s total gross services volume — a tiny fraction of the platform&#x27;s overall business and an acknowledgment of current AI limitations.\"The reality is that although we study AI, and I&#x27;ve been doing this for 25 years, and we see significant breakthroughs, the reality is that these agents aren&#x27;t that agentic,\" Rabinovich told VentureBeat. \"So if we go up the value chain, the problems become so much more difficult, then we don&#x27;t think they can solve them at all, even to scratch the surface. So we specifically chose simpler tasks that would give an agent some kind of traction.\"Even on these deliberately simplified tasks, AI agents working independently struggled. But when expert freelancers provided feedback — spending an average of just 20 minutes per review cycle — the agents&#x27; performance improved substantially with each iteration.20 minutes of human feedback boosted AI completion rates up to 70%The research reveals stark differences in how AI agents perform with and without human guidance across different types of work. For data science and analytics projects, Claude Sonnet 4 achieved a 64% completion rate working alone but jumped to 93% after receiving feedback from a human expert. In sales and marketing work, Gemini 2.5 Pro&#x27;s completion rate rose from 17% independently to 31% with human input. OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 showed similarly dramatic improvements in engineering and architecture tasks, climbing from 30% to 50% completion.The pattern held across virtually all categories, with agents responding particularly well to human feedback on qualitative, creative work requiring editorial judgment — areas like writing, translation, and marketing — where completion rates increased by up to 17 percentage points per feedback cycle.The finding challenges a fundamental assumption in the AI industry: that agent benchmarks conducted in isolation accurately predict real-world performance.\"While we show that in the tasks that we have selected for agents to perform in isolation, they perform similarly to the previous results that we&#x27;ve seen published openly, what we&#x27;ve shown is that in collaboration with humans, the performance of these agents improves surprisingly well,\" Rabinovich said. \"It&#x27;s not just a one-turn back and forth, but the more feedback the human provides, the better the agent gets at performing.\"Why ChatGPT can ace the SAT but can&#x27;t count the R&#x27;s in &#x27;strawberry&#x27;The research arrives as the AI industry grapples with a measurement crisis. Traditional benchmarks — standardized tests that AI models can master, sometimes scoring perfectly on SAT exams or mathematics olympiads — have proven poor predictors of real-world capability.\"With advances of large language models, what we&#x27;re now seeing is that these static, academic datasets are completely saturated,\" Rabinovich said. \"So you could get a perfect score in the SAT test or LSAT or any of the math olympiads, and then you would ask ChatGPT how many R&#x27;s there are in the word strawberry, and it would get it wrong.\"This phenomenon — where AI systems ace formal tests but stumble on trivial real-world questions — has led to growing skepticism about AI capabilities, even as companies race to deploy autonomous agents. Several recent benchmarks from other firms have tested AI agents on Upwork jobs, but those evaluations measured only isolated performance, not the collaborative potential that Upwork&#x27;s research reveals.\"We wanted to evaluate the quality of these agents on actual real work with economic value associated with it, and not only see how well these agents do, but also see how these agents do in collaboration with humans, because we sort of knew already that in isolation, they&#x27;re not that advanced,\" Rabinovich explained.For Upwork, which connects roughly 800,000 active clients posting more than 3 million jobs annually to a global pool of freelancers, the research serves a strategic business purpose: establishing quality standards for AI agents before allowing them to compete or collaborate with human workers on its platform.The economics of human-AI teamwork: Why paying for expert feedback still saves moneyDespite requiring multiple rounds of human feedback — each lasting about 20 minutes — the time investment remains \"orders of magnitude different between a human doing the work alone, versus a human doing the work with an AI agent,\" Rabinovich said. Where a project might take a freelancer days to complete independently, the agent-plus-human approach can deliver results in hours through iterative cycles of automated work and expert refinement.The economic implications extend beyond simple time savings. Upwork recently reported that gross services volume from AI-related work grew 53% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, one of the strongest growth drivers for the company. But executives have been careful to frame AI not as a replacement for freelancers but as an enhancement to their capabilities.\"AI was a huge overhang for our valuation,\" Erica Gessert, Upwork&#x27;s CFO, told CFO Brew in October. \"There was this belief that all work was going to go away. AI was going to take it, and especially work that&#x27;s done by people like freelancers, because they are impermanent. Actually, the opposite is true.\"The company&#x27;s strategy centers on enabling freelancers to handle more complex, higher-value work by offloading routine tasks to AI. \"Freelancers actually prefer to have tools that automate the manual labor and repetitive part of their work, and really focus on the creative and conceptual part of the process,\" Rabinovich said.Rather than replacing jobs, he argues, AI will transform them: \"Simpler tasks will be automated by agents, but the jobs will become much more complex in the number of tasks, so the amount of work and therefore earnings for freelancers will actually only go up.\"AI coding agents excel, but creative writing and translation still need humansThe research reveals a clear pattern in agent capabilities.

(Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images If you're a YouTube TV subscriber who relies on ESPN for football games, or maybe you never miss an episode of Dancing with the Stars (which airs on ABC), you're probably getting frustrated with the ongoing Disney feud. The two channels, along with other Disney-owned channels like Freeform and FX, have been off air since October 30, which is just over two weeks. While no resolution has been reached yet, the two large streaming companies are still negotiating the new pricing terms. One analyst has estimated that Disney is losing upwards of $4 million per day while the holdout continues. \"We’re ready to go as long as they want to,” said Disney's CFO Hugh Johnston on CNBC while discussing the company's quarterly earnings. Disney, of course, is trying to maximize the fees it gets for its channels, while YouTube claims Disney is \"proposing costly economic terms,\" which could result in higher subscription prices. But there's good news: YouTube has made good on its promise to offer a $20 credit to subscribers — you should've received an email from YouTube about it. However, it's not automatic so you'll need to claim it first — here's how to do it. How to get your $20 credit from YouTube TV YouTube TV already costs you at least $83 a month, so take advantage of the $20 credit while you can. Here's what you need to do.

While we still think you have the best shot to get the steepest discounts the closer to Black Friday we get, some of the discounts on Dyson's site right now are some of the best we've seen. One of those is 50 percent off the Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum, which is down to $500. Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) one of the strongest in the category. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we've tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you'll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson's mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you're looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don't mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option. Cordless vacuums are also a part of the sale. Take the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for just $270 at both Dyson and Amazon, which is a discount of $330. That's more than half off. Dyson devices are all over our list of the best cordless vacuums, and for good reason. The company makes effective products. The V9 Motorbar has been designed to clean all floor types, in addition to upholstery. It's also been engineered to squeeze into tight spots, which is great for hitting those oft-neglected parts of the home. The suction power is on point and the battery lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a charge. That's just enough time to vacuum a standard-sized home if you don't stop for too many breaks. The V9 is getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. If you want a newer model, the V11 Extra is on sale for $400, which is a discount of $260. This one boosts the suction power and increases the battery life to 60 minutes.

          "title": "Inside LinkedIn’s generative AI cookbook: How it scaled people search to 1.3 billion users",
          "standfirst": "LinkedIn is launching its new AI-powered people search this week, after what seems like a very long wait for what should have been a natural offering for generative AI.It comes a full three years after the launch of ChatGPT and six months after LinkedIn launched its AI job search offering. For technical leaders, this timeline illustrates a key enterprise lesson: Deploying generative AI in real enterprise settings is challenging, especially at a scale of 1.3 billion users. It’s a slow, brutal process of pragmatic optimization.The following account is based on several exclusive interviews with the LinkedIn product and engineering team behind the launch.First, here’s how the product works: A user can now type a natural language query like, \"Who is knowledgeable about curing cancer?\" into LinkedIn’s search bar.LinkedIn&#x27;s old search, based on keywords, would have been stumped. It would have looked only for references to \"cancer\". If a user wanted to get sophisticated, they would have had to run separate, rigid keyword searches for \"cancer\" and then \"oncology\" and manually try to piece the results together.The new AI-powered system, however, understands the intent of the search because the LLM under the hood grasps semantic meaning. It recognizes, for example, that \"cancer\" is conceptually related to \"oncology\" and even less directly, to \"genomics research.\" As a result, it surfaces a far more relevant list of people, including oncology leaders and researchers, even if their profiles don&#x27;t use the exact word \"cancer.\"The system also balances this relevance with usefulness. Instead of just showing the world&#x27;s top oncologist (who might be an unreachable third-degree connection), it will also weigh who in your immediate network — like a first-degree connection — is \"pretty relevant\" and can serve as a crucial bridge to that expert.See the video below for an example.Arguably, though, the more important lesson for enterprise practitioners is the \"cookbook\" LinkedIn has developed: a replicable, multi-stage pipeline of distillation, co-design, and relentless optimization. LinkedIn had to perfect this on one product before attempting it on another.\"Don&#x27;t try to do too much all at once,\" writes Wenjing Zhang, LinkedIn&#x27;s VP of Engineering, in a post about the product launch, and who also spoke with VentureBeat last week in an interview. She notes that an earlier \"sprawling ambition\" to build a unified system for all of LinkedIn&#x27;s products \"stalled progress.\"Instead, LinkedIn focused on winning one vertical first. The success of its previously launched AI Job Search — which led to job seekers without a four-year degree being 10% more likely to get hired, according to VP of Product Engineering Erran Berger — provided the blueprint.Now, the company is applying that blueprint to a far larger challenge. \"It&#x27;s one thing to be able to do this across tens of millions of jobs,\" Berger told VentureBeat. \"It&#x27;s another thing to do this across north of a billion members.\"For enterprise AI builders, LinkedIn&#x27;s journey provides a technical playbook for what it actually takes to move from a successful pilot to a billion-user-scale product.The new challenge: a 1.3 billion-member graphThe job search product created a robust recipe that the new people search product could build upon, Berger explained. The recipe started with with a \"golden data set\" of just a few hundred to a thousand real query-profile pairs, meticulously scored against a detailed 20- to 30-page \"product policy\" document. To scale this for training, LinkedIn used this small golden set to prompt a large foundation model to generate a massive volume of synthetic training data. This synthetic data was used to train a 7-billion-parameter \"Product Policy\" model — a high-fidelity judge of relevance that was too slow for live production but perfect for teaching smaller models.However, the team hit a wall early on. For six to nine months, they struggled to train a single model that could balance strict policy adherence (relevance) against user engagement signals. The \"aha moment\" came when they realized they needed to break the problem down. They distilled the 7B policy model into a 1.7B teacher model focused solely on relevance. They then paired it with separate teacher models trained to predict specific member actions, such as job applications for the jobs product, or connecting and following for people search. This \"multi-teacher\" ensemble produced soft probability scores that the final student model learned to mimic via KL divergence loss.The resulting architecture operates as a two-stage pipeline. First, a larger 8B parameter model handles broad retrieval, casting a wide net to pull candidates from the graph. Then, the highly distilled student model takes over for fine-grained ranking. While the job search product successfully deployed a 0.6B (600-million) parameter student, the new people search product required even more aggressive compression. As Zhang notes, the team pruned their new student model from 440M down to just 220M parameters, achieving the necessary speed for 1.3 billion users with less than 1% relevance loss.But applying this to people search broke the old architecture. The new problem included not just ranking but also retrieval.“A billion records,\" Berger said, is a \"different beast.\"The team’s prior retrieval stack was built on CPUs. To handle the new scale and the latency demands of a \"snappy\" search experience, the team had to move its indexing to GPU-based infrastructure. This was a foundational architectural shift that the job search product did not require.Organizationally, LinkedIn benefited from multiple approaches. For a time, LinkedIn had two separate teams — job search and people search — attempting to solve the problem in parallel. But once the job search team achieved its breakthrough using the policy-driven distillation method, Berger and his leadership team intervened. They brought over the architects of the job search win — product lead Rohan Rajiv and engineering lead Wenjing Zhang — to transplant their &#x27;cookbook&#x27; directly to the new domain.Distilling for a 10x throughput gainWith the retrieval problem solved, the team faced the ranking and efficiency challenge. This is where the cookbook was adapted with new, aggressive optimization techniques.Zhang’s technical post (I’ll insert the link once it goes live) provides the specific details our audience of AI engineers will appreciate. One of the more significant optimizations was input size.To feed the model, the team trained another LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) for a single purpose: to summarize the input context. This \"summarizer\" model was able to reduce the model&#x27;s input size by 20-fold with minimal information loss.The combined result of the 220M-parameter model and the 20x input reduction? A 10x increase in ranking throughput, allowing the team to serve the model efficiently to its massive user base.Pragmatism over hype: building tools, not agentsThroughout our discussions, Berger was adamant about something else that might catch peoples’ attention: The real value for enterprises today lies in perfecting recommender systems, not in chasing \"agentic hype.\" He also refused to talk about the specific models that the company used for the searches, suggesting it almost doesn&#x27;t matter. The company selects models based on which one it finds the most efficient for the task.The new AI-powered people search is a manifestation of Berger’s philosophy that it’s best to optimize the recommender system first. The architecture includes a new \"intelligent query routing layer,\" as Berger explained, that itself is LLM-powered. This router pragmatically decides if a user&#x27;s query — like \"trust expert\" — should go to the new semantic, natural-language stack or to the old, reliable lexical search.This entire, complex system is designed to be a \"tool\" that a future agent will use, not the agent itself.\"Agentic products are only as good as the tools that they use to accomplish tasks for people,\" Berger said. \"You can have the world&#x27;s best reasoning model, and if you&#x27;re trying to use an agent to do people search but the people search engine is not very good, you&#x27;re not going to be able to deliver.\" Now that the people search is available, Berger suggested that one day the company will be offering agents to use it. But he didn’t provide details on timing. He also said the recipe used for job and people search will be spread across the company’s other products.For enterprises building their own AI roadmaps, LinkedIn&#x27;s playbook is clear:Be pragmatic: Don&#x27;t try to boil the ocean. Win one vertical, even if it takes 18 months.Codify the \"cookbook\": Turn that win into a repeatable process (policy docs, distillation pipelines, co-design).Optimize relentlessly: The real 10x gains come after the initial model, in pruning, distillation, and creative optimizations like an RL-trained summarizer.LinkedIn&#x27;s journey shows that for real-world enterprise AI, emphasis on specific models or cool agentic systems should take a back seat. The durable, strategic advantage comes from mastering the pipeline — the &#x27;AI-native&#x27; cookbook of co-design, distillation, and ruthless optimization.(Editor&#x27;s note: We will be publishing a full-length podcast with LinkedIn&#x27;s Erran Berger, which will dive deeper into these technical details, on the VentureBeat podcast feed soon.)",

This router pragmatically decides if a user&#x27;s query — like \"trust expert\" — should go to the new semantic, natural-language stack or to the old, reliable lexical search.This entire, complex system is designed to be a \"tool\" that a future agent will use, not the agent itself.\"Agentic products are only as good as the tools that they use to accomplish tasks for people,\" Berger said. \"You can have the world&#x27;s best reasoning model, and if you&#x27;re trying to use an agent to do people search but the people search engine is not very good, you&#x27;re not going to be able to deliver.\" Now that the people search is available, Berger suggested that one day the company will be offering agents to use it. But he didn’t provide details on timing. He also said the recipe used for job and people search will be spread across the company’s other products.For enterprises building their own AI roadmaps, LinkedIn&#x27;s playbook is clear:Be pragmatic: Don&#x27;t try to boil the ocean. Win one vertical, even if it takes 18 months.Codify the \"cookbook\": Turn that win into a repeatable process (policy docs, distillation pipelines, co-design).Optimize relentlessly: The real 10x gains come after the initial model, in pruning, distillation, and creative optimizations like an RL-trained summarizer.LinkedIn&#x27;s journey shows that for real-world enterprise AI, emphasis on specific models or cool agentic systems should take a back seat. The durable, strategic advantage comes from mastering the pipeline — the &#x27;AI-native&#x27; cookbook of co-design, distillation, and ruthless optimization.(Editor&#x27;s note: We will be publishing a full-length podcast with LinkedIn&#x27;s Erran Berger, which will dive deeper into these technical details, on the VentureBeat podcast feed soon.)",

          "standfirst": "Alembic Technologies has raised $145 million in Series B and growth funding at a valuation 13 times higher than its previous round, betting that the next competitive advantage in artificial intelligence will come not from better language models but from proprietary data and causal reasoning.The San Francisco-based startup, which builds AI systems that identify cause-and-effect relationships rather than mere correlations, is using a significant portion of the capital to deploy what it claims is one of the fastest privately owned supercomputers ever built — an Nvidia NVL72 superPOD that will power its enterprise-grade causal AI models.The investment, led by Prysm Capital and Accenture with participation from Silver Lake Waterman, Liquid 2 Ventures, NextEquity, Friends & Family Capital and WndrCo, positions Alembic among a select group of well-funded AI laboratories transforming how corporations make multimillion-dollar decisions.The funding round and the company&#x27;s strategic direction reflect a broader shift taking place in enterprise AI as the performance gap between competing large language models narrows. While startups and tech giants have poured billions into building ever-larger chatbots, Alembic is pursuing a different thesis: that the real value in AI will accrue to systems that can process private corporate data to answer questions that generic models cannot.\"As powerful artificial intelligence models increasingly converge in capability, the key competitive advantage shifts to proprietary data,\" said Tomás Puig, Alembic&#x27;s founder and chief executive, in an interview with VentureBeat. \"Getting a real edge isn&#x27;t about using the best LLM; it&#x27;s leveraging the unique information rivals can&#x27;t access.\"Puig illustrated the problem facing enterprise executives: \"Imagine I run a CPG company and I install the latest ChatGPT. I ask, &#x27;Hey, ChatGPT, give me a strategy for how to increase my revenue share in the northeast.&#x27; Then your competitor down the road asks the exact same question. How much trouble are you in when they get the exact same answer?\"How a broke startup on Mac Pros discovered a breakthrough that changed everythingThe dramatic valuation increase—from roughly $50 million at the Series A to approximately $645 million now, according to people familiar with the matter — reflects a fundamental transformation in Alembic&#x27;s technology and market positioning since its previous funding round.When the company raised its Series A in early 2024, it was primarily a signal processing and correlation analytics company focused on marketing measurement. \"Causal did not exist as a technology for us till after the Series A,\" Puig told VentureBeat. The company was so resource-constrained that it couldn&#x27;t even run simulations to test whether its causal models would work.The breakthrough came after the Series A when the company finally had enough capital to test its theories. \"We were so broke that we couldn&#x27;t even run the simulation to see if it worked,\" Puig recalled. When they did run the tests — initially on an \"army of Mac Pros\" because they didn&#x27;t yet have GPU infrastructure — they discovered something unexpected: their causal model worked not just for marketing analytics but across virtually any business domain with time-series data.\"We started adding capabilities as customers requested them, which was just sensible—iterative,\" Puig explained. \"We found out the model works across a huge majority of data universally. What we thought might be a model for a specific vertical ended up being a full, generalized foundational model.\"That discovery transformed Alembic from a marketing technology vendor into a company building what Puig describes as \"the entire central nervous system of the enterprise across all verticals — not just sales, marketing, supply chain, finance, and beyond.\"Why cause-and-effect AI matters more than correlation for enterprise decision-makingCausal AI is a fundamentally different approach from the correlation-based analytics that dominate most business intelligence tools and even many AI systems. Where traditional analytics might show that social media engagement correlates with sales increases, causal AI can determine whether the social media activity actually caused the sales lift — or whether both were driven by some third factor, like a viral news event.The distinction matters enormously for executives making budget allocation decisions. \"Most businesses are not short on data,\" Puig said. \"They are short on answers.\"For Alembic&#x27;s customers, which now include Delta Air Lines, Mars, Nvidia and several Fortune 500 companies across financial services, technology and consumer packaged goods, the platform can answer previously unanswerable questions about marketing effectiveness, operational efficiency and strategic investments.\"Alembic&#x27;s ability to connect marketing exposure directly to business outcomes—with speed, precision and granularity—is what made this relationship so transformative for us,\" said Alicia Tillman, chief marketing officer at Delta Air Lines. \"Unlike traditional measurement tools, Alembic gave us a unified view across channels and campaigns, unlocking insights we simply couldn&#x27;t access before.\"The airline used Alembic to quantify the revenue lift from its Team USA Olympics sponsorship within days of activation, directly linking brand activities to ticket sales—a type of measurement that has eluded marketers for decades. Traditional attribution models either ignore brand-building entirely or assign it vague \"awareness\" metrics that don&#x27;t translate to financial impact.\"It&#x27;s very transformative,\" Puig said of the customer impact. \"What&#x27;s interesting is that executives themselves are the users of our software and our outputs. It&#x27;s not a tool used by a single campaign manager.\"Inside the two-story liquid-cooled supercomputer that literally melted GPUsAlembic&#x27;s decision to invest heavily in owned computing infrastructure rather than rely on cloud providers stems from both the technical demands of its causal models and the extreme data sensitivity requirements of its enterprise customers.The company is deploying an Nvidia NVL72 superPOD — a massive liquid-cooled system equipped with Nvidia&#x27;s most advanced Blackwell graphics processing units — in partnership with data center operator Equinix in San Jose, Calif. According to Puig, Nvidia informed Alembic that it is the only non-Fortune 500 company in the world to operate such a system.The need for this level of compute stems from how Alembic&#x27;s models work. Unlike large language models that are trained once on historical data and then deployed, Alembic&#x27;s system uses \"online and evolving\" models built on spiking neural networks — brain-inspired architectures that continuously learn as new data arrives.\"It creates itself as you feed it data, like human evolution,\" Puig explained. \"The model is singular, but it ends up creating a different brain for every single company.\"This continuous learning happens at massive scale. When a customer brings in data, Alembic&#x27;s system automatically permutates through billions of possible combinations of how that data could be analyzed — testing every conceivable way to slice metrics and dimensions to find the strongest causal signals. That level of computation requires what Puig calls \"F1 car\" infrastructure rather than the \"production Porsche\" offered by cloud providers.The company writes custom CUDA code and low-level GPU kernels optimized specifically for causal inference workloads — optimizations that aren&#x27;t possible on standard cloud configurations. The approach has proven so demanding that Alembic famously once melted down its GPUs by pushing them beyond their thermal limits. \"We literally just drive these circuits so hard that we need the F1 car version and we have to have access to it,\" Puig said.The move to liquid-cooled systems addresses that problem, but it also enables Alembic to run workloads that would cost orders of magnitude more on cloud platforms. \"We did the math—if we were to buy just one subsection of our compute from AWS, it would be $62 million a year,\" Puig said. Owning the infrastructure costs \"a fraction of that.\"The supercomputer strategy serves another crucial purpose: data sovereignty. Many of Alembic&#x27;s customers — particularly in financial services, consumer packaged goods and regulated industries — have contractual prohibitions against putting sensitive data on Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud.\"CPG companies do not want any data to exist on Amazon, ever,\" Puig said. \"They simply won&#x27;t allow it. Some customers refuse to use Microsoft, others avoid different providers. And certain banks and financial institutions are legally prohibited from using cloud platforms at all.\"By operating its own infrastructure in neutral data centers, Alembic can serve customers who would never consider cloud-based analytics — a competitive moat that would be difficult for hyperscale cloud providers to replicate.How Jensen Huang read a news article and changed Alembic&#x27;s destinyAlembic&#x27;s relationship with Nvidia illustrates both the startup&#x27;s technical ambitions and how the chip giant supports promising AI companies. Nvidia is Alembic&#x27;s founding enterprise customer, exclusive supercomputing partner and a key technical collaborator — though notably not an investor.The relationship began in an unlikely way. After Alembic announced its Series A funding in early 2024, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang read the VentureBeat coverage and emailed his staff suggesting they explore the company, according to Puig. Because Alembic didn&#x27;t yet have a contact form on its website, an Nvidia director reached out via LinkedIn.The partnership nearly foundered on a basic constraint: computing capacity. After Alembic delivered its first causal analysis — which took weeks to generate on an array of Mac Pros — Nvidia asked if they could produce weekly reports. \"I said no, because it took weeks on this army of machines,\" Puig recalled.When Alembic said they could do it with GPUs but couldn&#x27;t secure the necessary compute — cloud providers at the time required committee approvals and offered two- to six-week lead times with no guarantees — Nvidia intervened directly. The chip maker arranged for Equinix to provide a private cage in Northern Virginia with sufficient power capacity and helped Alembic source its first H100 GPU cluster.\"Without that, the company would never have existed,\" Puig said. \"We couldn&#x27;t get the compute in the configuration we needed anywhere else.\"The partnership has since deepened. Alembic uses Nvidia&#x27;s AI Enterprise software suite, including specialized libraries like cuGraph for graph processing and TensorRT for high-speed inference. The tight integration, Puig said, allows \"our research teams to leverage multi-exaflop-level compute and Nvidia&#x27;s algorithmic software stack. This integration is one of our secret weapons: we spend more time on breakthrough research and mathematics and less time on repetitive low-level engineering.\"Nvidia&#x27;s support extended beyond technology. When Alembic kept destroying GPUs under extreme workloads — pushing chips so hard that thermal stress cracked circuit boards — Nvidia fast-tracked the startup&#x27;s access to next-generation liquid-cooled systems. \"The funny reason we got [the NVL72],\" Puig said, \"is because when we melted the chips, Nvidia was literally annoyed with how often they had to service our warranty.\"From Olympics sponsorships to viral candy moments: How Fortune 500s measure what was unmeasurableAlembic&#x27;s customer roster has expanded rapidly as enterprises seek ways to measure AI and marketing investments that traditional analytics cannot capture. The company now works with Delta Air Lines, Mars, multiple Fortune 500 technology and financial services firms, and Texas A&M University&#x27;s athletics program.The use cases span far beyond Alembic&#x27;s original marketing focus. Mars used the platform to measure the sales impact of changing candy shapes for themed promotions. A Fortune 500 technology company expanded its sales pipeline by 37% using Alembic&#x27;s attribution models. Financial services firms are using it to connect CEO public appearances and co-marketing expenditures to actual fund flows.\"Alembic helped us move past impression counts to show what actually drove net-new investment,\" said the head of co-marketing at a Fortune 200 financial services company. \"For the first time, we could see how our CEO in the public eye and our co-marketing dollars with exchanges translated into real fund flows.\"For Mars, the ability to measure previously unmeasurable activities has transformed decision-making. \"We are using math to liberate creativity,\" said Gülen Bengi, lead global chief marketing officer for Mars and global chief growth officer for Mars Snacking. \"Our fans and communities create billions of organic conversations and content about our brands. When a viral moment happens, we normally know it&#x27;s directionally positive, but we can&#x27;t attribute the sales uplift or its place in the customer journey. Alembic&#x27;s Causal AI is a breakthrough, allowing us to move beyond correlation to see exactly how that organic conversation created a sequence that directly impacted sales.\"The platform can predict revenue, close rates and customer acquisition up to two years in advance with 95% confidence, according to Puig. \"What they were doing before was they actually literally did not know about certain things,\" he said, describing how customers previously estimated the value of stadium naming rights or major sponsorships without ever measuring actual dollar impact. \"Now you can go and be like it had this effect on this much P&L, and this is where it&#x27;s flowing, and you can know within days or near real time.\"Why Google, Meta and Nielsen can&#x27;t easily replicate what Alembic builtAlembic operates in a competitive landscape that includes traditional marketing measurement vendors like Nielsen, analytics platforms from Google and Meta, and emerging AI-powered analytics startups. But Puig argues the company has built structural advantages that would be difficult to replicate.First, the company&#x27;s causal models rely on proprietary mathematics developed over years and protected by patents. \"You would have to start from scratch,\" Puig said. \"This is not like an LLM that uses a transformer that has a paper, and you could attempt to recreate. You&#x27;d actually have to go and recreate the methodology from scratch.\"Second, the massive computing requirements create a natural barrier. Alembic operates at \"foundational model levels of compute, not like even something you would run from [AWS] Sagemaker,\" Puig said. \"We&#x27;re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a year\" in equivalent cloud costs.Third, the data sovereignty requirements of enterprise customers create opportunities for neutral third parties that hyperscale cloud providers struggle to address. As one venture capital investor noted, enterprises increasingly worry about putting strategic data into systems owned by potential competitors.Finally, Alembic&#x27;s ability to work with messy, fragmented data reflects years of engineering that preceded its causal AI breakthrough. \"The first four [or] five years of the company&#x27;s life was building that giant signal processor that dealt with messy data,\" Puig said. \"We would not be able to do it if we had not taken all that time.\"Why Alembic&#x27;s contrarian bet on private data could reshape enterprise AIThe $145 million funding round validates a contrarian bet in an AI landscape dominated by the race to build ever-larger language models. While OpenAI, Anthropic and others compete on whose chatbot can write better code or answer more trivia questions, Alembic is building infrastructure for a different kind of intelligence — one that understands cause and effect in the messy, proprietary data that defines each company&#x27;s unique competitive position.The company&#x27;s evolution from a bootstrapped startup running simulations on Mac Pros to operating one of the world&#x27;s fastest private supercomputers mirrors the broader maturation of enterprise AI. As the technology moves from experimentation to mission-critical deployment, companies need more than general-purpose models trained on public data. They need systems that can process their private information to answer questions their competitors cannot.Puig&#x27;s thesis — that private data becomes the key differentiator as public models converge — resonates with how other technologies evolved. Search engines commoditized access to public information, making proprietary data more valuable. Cloud computing made infrastructure a utility, elevating the importance of what you build on top of it. If large language models similarly converge in capability, the competitive advantage flows to whoever can best extract intelligence from data others cannot access.The company is already testing its technology beyond marketing analytics. Pilots are underway in robotics, where causal models could help autonomous systems understand how actions lead to outcomes. New product lines are launching, including the GPU-accelerated database that customers are buying separately. The ambition, Puig said, is to become \"the central nervous system\" of the enterprise — the layer that connects cause and effect across every business function.Whether Alembic can deliver on that vision remains to be seen. The company operates in complex enterprise environments where sales cycles are long and integration challenges are significant. Competitors aren&#x27;t standing still, and the technical moats that protect it today may erode as causal AI techniques become better understood.But for now, Alembic occupies a unique position. It has marquee customers achieving measurable results. It has infrastructure that would cost hundreds of millions to replicate on cloud platforms. It has proprietary mathematics refined over years of dealing with messy enterprise data. And it has $145 million to scale what Puig describes as a fundamental shift from correlation to causation.In his interview with VentureBeat, Puig drew a parallel to quantitative hedge funds that use mathematics to gain trading advantages that general-purpose AI cannot match. \"ChatGPT still can&#x27;t equal Renaissance Technologies,\" he said, referring to the secretive firm that has generated historic returns through quantitative models.The comparison captures Alembic&#x27;s core insight: that in a world where everyone has access to the same general-purpose AI, sustainable advantage comes from specialized systems that understand the cause-and-effect relationships hiding in your data. It&#x27;s a bet that the future of enterprise AI looks less like a universal chatbot and more like a private intelligence engine — one that, to Puig&#x27;s original point, prevents your competitor from getting the same answer when they ask the same question.",

They need systems that can process their private information to answer questions their competitors cannot.Puig&#x27;s thesis — that private data becomes the key differentiator as public models converge — resonates with how other technologies evolved. Search engines commoditized access to public information, making proprietary data more valuable. Cloud computing made infrastructure a utility, elevating the importance of what you build on top of it. If large language models similarly converge in capability, the competitive advantage flows to whoever can best extract intelligence from data others cannot access.The company is already testing its technology beyond marketing analytics. Pilots are underway in robotics, where causal models could help autonomous systems understand how actions lead to outcomes. New product lines are launching, including the GPU-accelerated database that customers are buying separately. The ambition, Puig said, is to become \"the central nervous system\" of the enterprise — the layer that connects cause and effect across every business function.Whether Alembic can deliver on that vision remains to be seen. The company operates in complex enterprise environments where sales cycles are long and integration challenges are significant. Competitors aren&#x27;t standing still, and the technical moats that protect it today may erode as causal AI techniques become better understood.But for now, Alembic occupies a unique position. It has marquee customers achieving measurable results. It has infrastructure that would cost hundreds of millions to replicate on cloud platforms. It has proprietary mathematics refined over years of dealing with messy enterprise data. And it has $145 million to scale what Puig describes as a fundamental shift from correlation to causation.In his interview with VentureBeat, Puig drew a parallel to quantitative hedge funds that use mathematics to gain trading advantages that general-purpose AI cannot match. \"ChatGPT still can&#x27;t equal Renaissance Technologies,\" he said, referring to the secretive firm that has generated historic returns through quantitative models.The comparison captures Alembic&#x27;s core insight: that in a world where everyone has access to the same general-purpose AI, sustainable advantage comes from specialized systems that understand the cause-and-effect relationships hiding in your data. It&#x27;s a bet that the future of enterprise AI looks less like a universal chatbot and more like a private intelligence engine — one that, to Puig&#x27;s original point, prevents your competitor from getting the same answer when they ask the same question.",

The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too. On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote. The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A young woolly mammoth now known as Yuka was frozen in the Siberian permafrost for about 40,000 years before it was discovered by local tusk hunters in 2010. The hunters soon handed it over to scientists, who were excited to see its exquisite level of preservation, with skin, muscle tissue, and even reddish hair intact. Later research showed that, while full cloning was impossible, Yuka’s DNA was in such good condition that some cell nuclei could even begin limited activity when placed inside mouse eggs. Now, a team has successfully sequenced Yuka’s RNA—a feat many researchers once thought impossible. Researchers at Stockholm University carefully ground up bits of muscle and other tissue from Yuka and nine other woolly mammoths, then used special chemical treatments to pull out any remaining RNA fragments, which are normally thought to be much too fragile to survive even a few hours after an organism has died. Scientists go to great lengths to extract RNA even from fresh samples, and most previous attempts with very old specimens have either failed or been contaminated. A different view The team used RNA-handling methods adapted for ancient, fragmented molecules. Their scientific séance allowed them to explore information that had never been accessible before, including which genes were active when Yuka died. In the creature’s final panicked moments, its muscles were tensing and its cells were signaling distress—perhaps unsurprising since Yuka is thought to have died as a result of a cave lion attack.Read full article Comments",

And it’s been that way almost from the beginning. A recent study of dog and wolf skulls from the last 50,000 years found that dogs living just after the last Ice Age were already about half as varied in their shape and size as modern dogs. “Shaped like a friend” means a lot of different things Biologist and archaeologist Allowen Evin, of CNRS, and her colleagues compared the size and shape of 643 skulls from dogs and wolves: 158 from modern dogs, 86 from modern wolves, and 391 from archaeological sites around the world spanning the last 50,000 years. By comparing the locations and sizes of certain skeletal landmarks, such as bony protrusions where muscles attached, the researchers could quantify how different one skull was from another. That suggested a few things about how dogs, or at least the shapes of their heads, have evolved over time. The team’s results suggest that dogs that lived during the Mesolithic (before settled farming life came into fashion in the Middle East) and the Neolithic (after farming took off but before the heyday of copper smelting; 10,000 BCE is a general starting point) were a surprisingly diverse bunch, at least in terms of the size and shape of their skulls.Read full article Comments",

Looking back on the game some 13 years later, Arkane’s well-constructed world of steam punk magical realism earns its place as a modern classic. The game does a great job of drawing you into that world immediately, with a memorable opening sequence that sees you framed for the on-screen murder of the empress you’ve been sworn to protect. The scene does a great job establishing the emotional stakes of the coming missions while also throwing you into the deep end of the political infighting that has consumed a besieged, plague-beset kingdom. A Victorian steam punk world you can lose yourself in. Credit: Arkane Studios Those stakes, and a battle against a real feeling of injustice, drive the plot through some admittedly predictable beats as Dishonored continues through a set of sneak-and-assassinate missions. But it’s hard to care about that predictability when even minor side characters on both sides of the conflict quickly develop from stereotypes to engaging, fleshed-out characters.Read full article Comments",

In September, the reports said, Anthropic discovered a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign,” carried out by a Chinese state-sponsored group, that used Claude Code to automate up to 90 percent of the work. Human intervention was required “only sporadically (perhaps 4-6 critical decision points per hacking campaign).” Anthropic said the hackers had employed AI agentic capabilities to an “unprecedented” extent. “This campaign has substantial implications for cybersecurity in the age of AI ‘agents’—systems that can be run autonomously for long periods of time and that complete complex tasks largely independent of human intervention,” Anthropic said. “Agents are valuable for everyday work and productivity—but in the wrong hands, they can substantially increase the viability of large-scale cyberattacks.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Yesterday’s announcement of new living room and VR hardware from Valve obviously has many gamers clamoring for any news of a more powerful version of the nearly 4-year-old Steam Deck. In a new interview with IGN, though, Valve Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais says that portable gaming silicon still hasn’t advanced enough to justify brand-new benchmark hardware. “The thing we’re making sure of is that it’s a worthwhile enough performance upgrade [for a Steam Deck 2] to make sense as a standalone product,” Griffais told IGN. “We’re not interested in getting to a point where it’s 20 or 30 or even 50 percent more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that.” “So we’ve been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there’s no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck,” Griffais continued.Read full article Comments",

Users and developers didn’t accept Google’s rationale and have been complaining loudly. As Google begins early access testing, it has conceded that “experienced users” should have an escape hatch. According to Google, online scam and malware campaigns are getting more aggressive, and there’s real harm being done in spite of the platform’s sideloading scare screens. Google says it’s common for scammers to use social engineering to create a false sense of urgency, prompting users to bypass Android’s built-in protections to install malicious apps. Google’s solution to this problem, as announced several months ago, is to force everyone making apps to verify their identities. Unverified apps won’t install on any Google-certified device once verification rolls out. Without this, the company claims malware creators can endlessly create new apps to scam people. However, the centralized nature of verification threatened to introduce numerous headaches into a process that used to be straightforward for power users.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Mars is cold, parched, and extremely dusty. Powerful gusts of wind kick up literal tons of reddish dust that often takes the form of whorls known as dust devils. These winds also shroud the planet in dust by lifting material from the surface and blowing it into the atmosphere (what little Mars has left of an atmosphere), sometimes creating dust storms that rage for days. Researcher Valentin Bickel wanted to know just how intense winds can be on the red planet. Using data obtained by the Mars camera CaSSIS (Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System), the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and stereo camera HRSC (High Resolution Stereo Camera) on board ESA orbiter Mars Express, he and his team used deep learning to analyze stereo images that were taken seconds apart at the same location. These images can track the motion of dust devils, and the researchers use them to infer how the winds behind the dust devils move and lift dust from the surface. That dust goes on to have a big influence on the Martian weather. Bickel, of the Center for Space and Habitability at the University of Bern, noticed that the tumultuous Martian winds are even faster than previous observations had made them out to be. They carry more dust than was previously thought. “Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate,” the researchers said in a study recently published in Science Advances.Read full article Comments",

At the high end of those guesses are analysts like F-Squared‘s Michael Futter, who expects a starting price of $799 to $899 for the entry-level 512GB Steam Machine and a whopping $1,000 to $1,100 for the 2TB version. With internal specs that Futter says “will rival a PS5 and maybe even hit PS5 Pro performance,” we can expect a “hefty price tag” from Valve’s new console-like effort. At the same time, since Valve is “positioning this as a dedicated, powerful gaming PC… I suspect that the price will be below a similarly capable traditional desktop,” Futter said. DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole similarly expects the Steam Machine to start at a price “around $800” and go up to “around $1,000” for the 2TB model. Cole said he expects Valve will seek “very low margins” or even break-even pricing on the hardware itself, which he said would probably lead to pricing “below a gaming PC but slightly above a high-end console.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Science fiction has long speculated about the possibility of first contact with an alien species from a distant world and how we might be able to communicate with them. But what if we simply don’t have enough common ground for that to even be possible? An alien species is bound to be biologically very different, and their language will be shaped by their home environment, broader culture, and even how they perceive the universe. They might not even share the same math and physics. These and other fascinating questions are the focus of an entertaining new book, Do Aliens Speak Physics? And Other Questions About Science and the Nature of Reality. Co-author Daniel Whiteson is a particle physicist at the University of California, Irvine, who has worked on the ATLAS collaboration at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. He’s also a gifted science communicator who previously co-authored two books with cartoonist Jorge Cham of PhD Comics fame: 2018’s We Have No Idea and 2021’s Frequently Asked Questions About the Universe. (The pair also co-hosted a podcast from 2018 to 2024, Daniel and Jorge Explain the Universe.) This time around, cartoonist Andy Warner provided the illustrations, and Whiteson and Warner charmingly dedicate their book to “all the alien scientists we have yet to meet.” Whiteson has long been interested in the philosophy of physics. “I’m not the kind of physicist who’s like, ‘whatever, let’s just measure stuff,'” he told Ars. “The thing that always excited me about physics was this implicit promise that we were doing something universal, that we were learning things that were true on other planets. But the more I learned, the more concerned I became that this might have been oversold. None are fundamental, and we don’t understand why anything emerges. Can we separate the human lens from the thing we’re looking at? We don’t know in the end how much that lens is distorting what we see or defining what we’re looking at. So that was the fundamental question I always wanted to explore.”Read full article Comments",
