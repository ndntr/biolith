The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks. Table of contents Best smartwatches for 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Other smartwatches our experts tested Smartwatch FAQs Best smartwatches of 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Fossil Yes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please. Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Compatibility Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone. The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things. Price The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials. Battery life Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates. Communication Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now. Fitness tracking Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well. Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more. Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Music Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds. Displays Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives. You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again. NFC Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth. Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems. Other smartwatches our experts tested Apple Watch Ultra 3 The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple Watch SE 3 The Apple Watch SE 3 is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay. Amazfit Bip 6 The Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably. The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily. We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere). Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter Smartwatch FAQs Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker? While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes. A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind. A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice. How long do smartwatches last? How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability. Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster. Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support. You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary. How much should you spend on a smartwatch? How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it. If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two. High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.

High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.

          "standfirst": "Sony just dropped a new video with Mark Cerny, and it’s a big one, with significant implications for the company’s next console and AMD’s future GPUs. Over nearly nine minutes, Cerny, who was the lead designer for the PlayStation 4 and PS5, chats with Jack Huynh, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics Group, about a series of technologies, collectively dubbed Project Amethyst, the two companies are developing together. According to Cerny, those technologies “only exist in simulations” right now, but they’re broadly designed to make the next PlayStation better at ray tracing, upscaling and other machine learning-based rendering techniques.If you know anything about AMD graphics cards, it’s that they’ve historically offered poor ray tracing performance relative to NVIDIA’s RTX GPUs. For years, AMD tried to bridge the gap with cards that outmuscled NVIDIA’s offerings with better rasterization performance, an approach the company now admits won’t work for modern, graphically intensive games. “Trying to brute force [ray-tracing] with raw power alone just doesn’t scale,” Huynh said. AMD’s solution is an entirely new architecture that combines two hardware innovations: Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores.In AMD’s older GPUs, the individual compute units are designed to work independently of one another. This approach worked great for a long time, but in modern games — dependent as they are on expensive upscaling techniques likes FSR and Sony’s own PSSR to deliver playable framerates at high resolutions — it can lead to inefficiencies. AMD is trying to solve that problem with Neural Arrays, which give the compute units a way to work together and share data between one another.According to Huynh, AMD isn’t linking an entire GPU together, as that would create a cable-management nightmare, but it is giving the silicon a way to process a “large chunk” of the screen in one go. In practice, he says that should allow the next PlayStation and AMD’s future video cards to offer a “whole new level of machine learning performance.” In turn, that will translate to better and faster upscaling performance, alongside better ray regeneration. The latter is something NVIDIA already offers with DLSS Ray Reconstruction and in games that support the technology, it translates to better-looking ray tracing effects and improved performance.As for Radiance Cores, it sound like AMD is taking another page from NVIDIA. For the uninitiated, the company’s RTX cards feature dedicated, fixed-function “RT” cores designed to accelerate the math needed to simulate light rays in real-time. Huynh says the Radiance Cores are an entirely new hardware block designed to handle ray and path tracing. “It’s a brand-new rendering approach for AMD,” he added. As a bonus, by taking on this work, the Radiance Cores will free up other parts of AMD’s new GPUs to process shaders and textures more quickly, leading to further efficiency gains.Lastly, the two companies are working on new software they’re calling Universal Compression. It builds on the PS5 and PS5 Pro’s existing Delta Color Compression technique. It will theoretically allow Sony’s next console to compress everything that goes through its graphics pipeline, reducing the amount memory bandwidth needed by the GPU and potentially reducing its power consumption.Again, I’ll note Cerny said it’s still “early days” for all the technologies he and Huynh discussed, but it’s reassuring to know Sony and AMD are thinking about how to best approach ray tracing performance and upscaling. Techniques like ray-traced global illumination can completely change the look of a game, making for a more immersive experience. If Sony and AMD can find ways to make those technologies less expensive to run, that’s a win for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-and-amd-tease-the-gpu-tech-theyre-building-for-the-next-playstation-172500942.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Although October Prime Day is over, you can still grab some of our favorite deals on brand-name SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards, including several storage solutions compatible with the Switch 2. If you've never considered adding a solid-state drive (SSD) to your PC or game console, now is a great time to start — and if you already know what a difference extra storage can make, it's still a fine time to outfit your build. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth to process huge chunks of data in parallel, getting everything done faster while keeping your device from running too hot. Some of the best products in the field are still discounted, so let's get into it. Best Prime Day microSD card deals Samsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming. SanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $120 (19 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast. Best Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 (28 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $151 (28 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $418 (27 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Samsung 870 EVO SATA III Internal SSD 1TB for $95 (19 percent off): Samsung's 870 Evo series consists of some of the best entry-level SSD storage available. While it's not quite as fast as the Samsung 990s above, it still posts read and write speeds around 550MB/s, enough for a visible difference when organizing a media library. It's also way more affordable. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $240 (27 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 (19 percent off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. WD_BLACK 8TB SN850X for $544 (20 percent off): Honestly, we can't think of a lot of people who need an SSD with 8TB of storage — but if you're one of those people, this is the deal of a lifetime. The SN850X is both capacious and high-functioning, including both a heatsink and a digital dashboard you can use to monitor its performance. The smaller, cheaper versions are also marked down. Best Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $89 (23 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.

          "title": "The best foldable phones for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Foldable phones have gone from futuristic novelties to genuinely useful devices that blend portability with big-screen versatility. Whether you're into multitasking, mobile gaming or just love having a phone that turns heads, the best foldable phones you can buy offer powerful performance, durable designs and impressive displays that unfold to reveal more room for apps, videos and productivity.From book-style designs to flip-style clamshells, the best foldable phone for you depends on how you like to use your device. Some models focus on flagship-level power and multitasking features, while others aim to keep things compact and stylish. Either way, these folding handsets are pushing the boundaries of what smartphones can do.Note: For this guide, we’re focusing on devices that are widely available in North America and Europe. That’s because while there are even more options for people who live in Asia (especially China), they are often difficult to buy from abroad and may not support your local carriers. Table of contents Best foldable phones for 2025 How we test foldable phones Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability Foldable phone FAQs Best foldable phones for 2025 How we test foldable phones When evaluating new foldable phones, we consider the same general criteria as we do when we’re judging the best smartphones. Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people. For those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened. Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability Aside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IP68 designs or IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges. Most foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions). Furthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for. However, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you. Foldable phone FAQs What is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone? Foldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open. What is the disadvantage of a foldable phone? The biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use. Are foldable phones less durable than other phones? Generally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass. They're definitely more durable than they used to be, but they still require a bit more care than your average smartphone.

          "content": "Foldable phones have gone from futuristic novelties to genuinely useful devices that blend portability with big-screen versatility. Whether you're into multitasking, mobile gaming or just love having a phone that turns heads, the best foldable phones you can buy offer powerful performance, durable designs and impressive displays that unfold to reveal more room for apps, videos and productivity.From book-style designs to flip-style clamshells, the best foldable phone for you depends on how you like to use your device. Some models focus on flagship-level power and multitasking features, while others aim to keep things compact and stylish. Either way, these folding handsets are pushing the boundaries of what smartphones can do.Note: For this guide, we’re focusing on devices that are widely available in North America and Europe. That’s because while there are even more options for people who live in Asia (especially China), they are often difficult to buy from abroad and may not support your local carriers. Table of contents Best foldable phones for 2025 How we test foldable phones Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability Foldable phone FAQs Best foldable phones for 2025 How we test foldable phones When evaluating new foldable phones, we consider the same general criteria as we do when we’re judging the best smartphones. Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people. For those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened. Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability Aside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IP68 designs or IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges. Most foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions). Furthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for. However, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you. Foldable phone FAQs What is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone? Foldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open. What is the disadvantage of a foldable phone? The biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use. Are foldable phones less durable than other phones? Generally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass.

          "standfirst": "As the 7-pound Razer Blade 18 sat on my desk, its all-black unibody case and enormous 18-inch screen towering before me like the monolith from 2001, I couldn’t help but think, “Who the hell needs such a big-ass computer?” I’m sure they’re out there — the gamers with deep pockets and little regard for portability, the video editors who demand as much screen space as possible. But on the whole, the market for the Blade 18 is pretty small, especially whenRazer’s Blade 14 and 16 strike a far better balance of price, performance and weight. What the Razer Blade 18 promises, if you choose to accept its gargantuan proportions, is unbridled power and screen real estate. It’s running Intel’s new Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, a 24-core beast with a maximum speed of 5.4GHz. Its 18-inch screen can reach up to 240Hz at slightly over 4K (3,840 by 2,400 pixels) and 440Hz when downscaled to 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200). And of course, you can equip it with NVIDIA’s fastest mobile GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. Given everything under the hood, it’s honestly impressive it weighs just seven pounds, alongside a 2.1-pound power adapter. (In comparison, the similarly premium 18-inch Alienware Area 51 comes in at 9.5 pounds with a 2.2-pound power adapter.) When we last reviewed the Razer Blade 18 a few years ago, my colleague Sam Rutherford bristled at the laptop’s size, battery life and high cost (which could reach upwards of $5,000 when fully decked out). All of those points are absolutely fair, but this time around it’s easier to see what Razer is trying to do with the Blade 18: It’s simply doing the most for the people who demand it. And it’s doing so with the excellent build quality we’ve come to expect from Razer (albeit with a high $2,799 starting price). If you’re still trying to wrap your head around why an 18-inch laptop even exists, the Razer Blade 18 isn’t for you. And honestly, the concept isn’t even that farfetched. Given the move towards thinner display bezels and other refinements, laptop makers have been able to squeeze in larger screens inside of their typical case sizes. The Razer Blade 16 was a bit heavier than the Blade 15 when it launched, but now Razer has slimmed its case down considerably. The Blade 18 similarly serves as an upgrade to the old Blade 17 — and what an upgrade it is. Razer Blade 18 from the side, viewing a few ports. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget My review unit, which was equipped with that new Intel chip, an RTX 5090, 64GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD tackled Cyberpunk 2077 with all of its settings cranked without a sweat. At its native resolution, which again is a bit higher than 4K, it reached 131 fps with 4X frame generation (which uses DLSS 4’s upscaling to interpolate additional frames). That’s roughly half as fast as the desktop RTX 5090 running in 4K with the same settings — but don’t forget, that GPU alone typically runs between $2,000 to $3,000 these days. Razer charges an additional $1,400 to upgrade the Blade 18 from an RTX 5070 Ti to the 5090. (And for the record, the total cost for our fully decked out testing unit was $4,599.) Beyond frame rates, Cyberpunk 2077 simply looked great on the Blade 18’s 240Hz IPS LED display. It’s not as bright as the MiniLED screens Razer offers on the Blade 16, and it doesn’t offer the insane contrast levels of an OLED screen, but it does the job well. For the price, though, it would have been nice to see more modern screen technology. Like the Blade 16, the 18 also offers a dual-mode display, which is how it reaches those higher 440Hz refresh rates in 1080p+. Razer Blade 18 rear case Devindra Hardawar for Engadget It worked as advertised in Overwatch 2, where I played several matches well above 300fps with high quality settings. The additional visible frames are particularly helpful during fast-paced moments, where you may have the blink of an eye to take out an opponent before they headshot you. I had no doubt the Blade 18 would be fast, but I also noticed that it felt genuinely more immersive than the Blade 16 because of its more expansive display. As I leaned in during Cyberpunk 2077, Halo Infinite and Overwatch sessions, it almost felt like I was in front of a desktop setup. That’s ultimately what you’re paying for with this machine. When I opened up audio files in Audacity, I also noticed that the additional screen space simply made it easier to sift through my timelines. PCMark 10 3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme) Geekbench 6 CPU Cinebench R23 Razer Blade 18 (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, NVIDIA RTX 5090) 7,703 12,228 2,733/19,340 1,104/33,150 Razer Blade 16 (2023, Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4090) 7,364 8,667 2,713/16,245 2,024/15,620 Razer Blade 18 (2023, Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4060) 7,326 5,009 2,708/12,874 1,900/15,442 When it comes to direct benchmarks, the Core Ultra 9 chip isn’t much better than Intel’s 13th-gen hardware in single-threaded tasks, and it’s sometimes best by AMD’s latest batch of hardware. Intel has made significant progress in multi-threaded tests like Geekbench 6, though, and that sort of performance makes the Blade 18 ideal for tasks like video rendering and complex games. The Blade 18 also ran remarkably cool: During a 3DMark stress test, which involved running one demo 20 times in a row, the CPU stayed at 70 degrees Celsius most of the time, with occasional spikes to 85C. During the CPU-heavy Cinebench tests, Intel’s chip jumped to 80C on average with some jumps to 90C. The GPU, meanwhile, held a steady 70C and never wavered during 3DMark benchmarks. The fans sure can get loud, though, as you’d expect for a system that’s relatively thin and needs to pump out a ton of heat. Razer Blade 18 power, Ethernet, USB 2 and USB-C ports. Razer has been building sturdy and attractive gaming laptops for well over a decade now, so it’s not a huge surprise that the Blade 18 feels incredibly solid and premium. Its keyboard has a great depth to it that feels just as good playing shooters as it does while typing, and its trackpad is wonderfully smooth and accurate. (It does get a bit overzealous when detecting multi-touch gestures, though.) Port-wise, the Blade 18 also packs in everything you’d want, including three USB Type-A 3.2 connections, one Thunderbolt 5 USB-C port, a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, 2.5Gb Ethernet and a full-sized SD card slot. Personally, if I had to choose between Razer’s current lineup, I’d go with the Blade 16 so that I could actually carry it around and occasionally use it as a productivity machine. Not so with the Blade 18 — its short two hour and 17 minute battery life (in PCMark 10’s battery benchmark) means you’ll always need to lug around its beefy power adapter. After an hour of writing this review, its battery life also dropped from fully charged to 38 percent. But really, nobody is buying this thing just to deal with spreadsheets and emails. You want ultimate power and an enormous screen? Then battery life will suffer.

          "title": "Echelon's AI agents take aim at Accenture and Deloitte consulting models",
          "standfirst": "Echelon, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end ServiceNow implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.\"The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn&#x27;t technology — it&#x27;s the time it takes to implement it,\" said Rahul Kayala, Echelon&#x27;s founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company Moveworks. \"AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed.\"The announcement signals a potential disruption to the $1.5 trillion global IT services market, where companies like Accenture, Deloitte, and Capgemini have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millionsServiceNow, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.The complexity stems from ServiceNow&#x27;s vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of \"catalog items\" — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon&#x27;s research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.\"What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins,\" the company noted in its analysis of common implementation challenges. \"A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break.\"The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: \"One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you&#x27;re weeks behind.\"How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teamsEchelon&#x27;s approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite ServiceNow experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.\"Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements,\" Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. \"The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: &#x27;I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?&#x27; The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly.\"Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months completed in six weeks using Echelon&#x27;s AI agents.What makes Echelon&#x27;s AI different from coding assistantsEchelon&#x27;s technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow&#x27;s technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.The company&#x27;s training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like Accenture and specialized ServiceNow partner Thirdera. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.The real challenge isn&#x27;t teaching AI to write code — it&#x27;s capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruptionEchelon&#x27;s emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over $10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.The startup&#x27;s approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon&#x27;s funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. \"We see the same trend with other BCV companies like Prophet Security, which automates security operations, and Crosby, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions.\"Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliabilityDespite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.\"Inertia is the biggest risk,\" Garg acknowledged. \"IT systems shouldn&#x27;t ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon.\"The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including SAP, Salesforce, and Workday — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.Echelon also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.\"They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time,\" he said. \"Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects.\"How AI agents could reshape all professional servicesEchelon&#x27;s funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon&#x27;s directly replace skilled labor at scale.The company&#x27;s approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services.

          "content": "Echelon, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end ServiceNow implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.\"The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn&#x27;t technology — it&#x27;s the time it takes to implement it,\" said Rahul Kayala, Echelon&#x27;s founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company Moveworks. \"AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed.\"The announcement signals a potential disruption to the $1.5 trillion global IT services market, where companies like Accenture, Deloitte, and Capgemini have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millionsServiceNow, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.The complexity stems from ServiceNow&#x27;s vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of \"catalog items\" — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon&#x27;s research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.\"What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins,\" the company noted in its analysis of common implementation challenges. \"A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break.\"The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: \"One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you&#x27;re weeks behind.\"How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teamsEchelon&#x27;s approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite ServiceNow experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.\"Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements,\" Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. \"The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: &#x27;I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?&#x27; The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly.\"Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months completed in six weeks using Echelon&#x27;s AI agents.What makes Echelon&#x27;s AI different from coding assistantsEchelon&#x27;s technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow&#x27;s technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.The company&#x27;s training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like Accenture and specialized ServiceNow partner Thirdera. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.The real challenge isn&#x27;t teaching AI to write code — it&#x27;s capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruptionEchelon&#x27;s emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over $10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.The startup&#x27;s approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon&#x27;s funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. \"We see the same trend with other BCV companies like Prophet Security, which automates security operations, and Crosby, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions.\"Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliabilityDespite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.\"Inertia is the biggest risk,\" Garg acknowledged. \"IT systems shouldn&#x27;t ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon.\"The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including SAP, Salesforce, and Workday — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.Echelon also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.\"They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time,\" he said. \"Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects.\"How AI agents could reshape all professional servicesEchelon&#x27;s funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon&#x27;s directly replace skilled labor at scale.The company&#x27;s approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services.

          "standfirst": "It's true: October Prime Day 2025 is over. But you can't expect a site like Amazon to shut down every deal — the company was built on the discount. Today, we hunted down the tech deals under $50 that are still available. While there's a lot fewer deals than there were yesterday (we counted 59 on Wednesday and just 19 today) some decent brands, like Ugreen, Anker, Lego and Roku are still in stock. Interestingly, a few of the current-model Echo smart speakers are still discounted, too, likely as a way to get the new Alexa+ into as many homes as possible. Who knows how long these sale prices will stick around. But if you miss them, don't fret, Black Friday is just around the corner. Best Prime Day tech deals under $50 still available PNY microSD Express (128GB) for $39 ($6 off with Prime): If you’ve gotten yourself a Switch 2 (or planning to gift one for the Holidays) you may want to get a couple microSD Express cards. They’re the only type that work with the new console, which you can read all about in our guide to Switch 2 storage. This is one of the cards we recommend. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $39 ($16 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $35 ($11 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. It went as low as $33 for Prime Day. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $45 ($25 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one.

Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. It went for $23 during the sale. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers.

Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-19-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-still-available-from-anker-roku-ugreen-and-others-120531063.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You can get Sony's WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones for $250 in a limited time deal for Amazon Prime Day. That's $150 off its launch price, $50 off its regular Amazon list price and only a cent more than its all-time low of $249.99. While the model was released a few years ago, it's still a fantastic alternative to the newer but pricier WH-1000XM6, which you can also get with a discount of $20 from Amazon right now. We gave the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 when we reviewed it and praised its redesign for providing a massive increase in comfort. When it comes to sound quality, we found its bass punchier than its predecessors'. The model provided more depth and more clarity than the WH-1000XM4, which made the listening experience more immersive. Sony doubled the the number of processors and the number of microphones that handle noise cancelation on the WH-1000XM5, as well, making it better at blocking sounds with higher frequencies like human voices. Of course, the WH-1000XM6 has better sound quality and an improved active noise cancellation technology. But with a price of $450 — currently $428 for Prime Day — it's a much bigger expense. If you don't mind getting an even older model, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is also on sale for $188. The model, released in 2020, has dated features by now compared to the newer iterations of the headphones. But Sony's WH-1000X headphones have always been some of the best, and a five-year-old model could be better than some newer devices out there.

          "title": "The best Apple deals on MacBooks, AirPods, iPads and more following Amazon's Prime Day sale",
          "standfirst": "Amazon's latest October Prime Day sale has come and gone, but a number of Apple device deals we saw during the event are still available. If you've been waiting for a discount and don't want to hold out until Black Friday, gadgets like the AirPods 4, iPad (A16) and MacBook Air remain in stock for the lowest prices we've tracked. To make things a little easier for you, we've compiled all the best Prime Day Apple deals that are still live below. Best iPad deals still available Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): We call the Air the best Apple tablet for most people in our guide to the best iPads. While it’s a good bit more expensive than the base model, it has a handful of subtle improvements that add up in day-to-day use. Its speakers are better. Its display is more color-rich, more glare-resistant and laminated, which means there’s no “gap” between the display and the actual glass. There’s a faster chip and more RAM for gaming or more involved tasks. It also works with the Apple Pencil Pro and comfier Magic Keyboard. We saw the purple model fall as low as $437 on Prime Day, but this $150 discount matches the best price we've seen otherwise. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as the 11-inch model, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. It should be nice if you’re willing to trade a little portability for more space for working or taking in movies. We gave this model a score of 89 in our review back in March. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you want a display you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 higher than the one we saw during Prime Day, but it's still a good drop compared to buying from Apple directly. Best Mac deals still available Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Other configs with more memory and storage are $200 off and still in stock as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This deal is slightly higher than the laptop’s all-time low, and it’s another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s a decent drop from Apple’s usual list price. Again, other versions with more memory and storage are also on sale. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $500 ($99 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint while adding a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Best AirPods deals still available Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): The entry-level AirPods get you tons of Apple-friendly features — from fast pairing with your iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri — and their lightweight design should fit most ears more comfortably than previous models. They still aren’t the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair, and they don't support wireless charging, Find My tracking or built-in volume controls. They won’t block much outside noise either. But if you’re an iPhone owner who truly hates the feeling of earphones that jut into your ear canal, they’re a worthy value with this discount, which comes within a dollar of the lowest price we’ve seen. Engadget’s Billy Steele gave the AirPods 4 a review score of 88 last year. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 ($60 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support. They have the same open-style design, so the ANC isn't as effective as what you'd get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds more useful in noisy areas all the same. This pair earned a score of 86 in our review, and the discount matches the lowest price we've tracked. Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weird, flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, they offer most of the conveniences of the in-ear AirPods, while their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s all-time low, but it’s the best price we’ve seen since July. Best Apple accessories deals still available Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Best Apple Watch deals still available Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches last month, but Amazon is still selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) for $390 ($9 off): The Series 11 is the top overall pick in our guide to the best smartwatches. It’s not as compelling as the SE 3 from a value perspective, but it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, slightly longer battery life and support for more advanced health features like hypertension alerts and an ECG app. We gave it a score of 90 in our review. Just note that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you’re happy with your current Apple Watch. This is just a $9 discount, but we note it since the Series 11 has been on sale for less than a month, so any bit of savings are welcome. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since the Ultra 3 is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-apple-deals-on-macbooks-airpods-ipads-and-more-following-amazons-prime-day-sale-125644027.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Amazon's latest October Prime Day sale has come and gone, but a number of Apple device deals we saw during the event are still available. If you've been waiting for a discount and don't want to hold out until Black Friday, gadgets like the AirPods 4, iPad (A16) and MacBook Air remain in stock for the lowest prices we've tracked. To make things a little easier for you, we've compiled all the best Prime Day Apple deals that are still live below. Best iPad deals still available Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): We call the Air the best Apple tablet for most people in our guide to the best iPads. While it’s a good bit more expensive than the base model, it has a handful of subtle improvements that add up in day-to-day use. Its speakers are better. Its display is more color-rich, more glare-resistant and laminated, which means there’s no “gap” between the display and the actual glass. There’s a faster chip and more RAM for gaming or more involved tasks. It also works with the Apple Pencil Pro and comfier Magic Keyboard. We saw the purple model fall as low as $437 on Prime Day, but this $150 discount matches the best price we've seen otherwise. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as the 11-inch model, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. It should be nice if you’re willing to trade a little portability for more space for working or taking in movies. We gave this model a score of 89 in our review back in March. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you want a display you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 higher than the one we saw during Prime Day, but it's still a good drop compared to buying from Apple directly. Best Mac deals still available Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Other configs with more memory and storage are $200 off and still in stock as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This deal is slightly higher than the laptop’s all-time low, and it’s another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s a decent drop from Apple’s usual list price. Again, other versions with more memory and storage are also on sale. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $500 ($99 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint while adding a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Best AirPods deals still available Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): The entry-level AirPods get you tons of Apple-friendly features — from fast pairing with your iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri — and their lightweight design should fit most ears more comfortably than previous models. They still aren’t the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair, and they don't support wireless charging, Find My tracking or built-in volume controls. They won’t block much outside noise either. But if you’re an iPhone owner who truly hates the feeling of earphones that jut into your ear canal, they’re a worthy value with this discount, which comes within a dollar of the lowest price we’ve seen. Engadget’s Billy Steele gave the AirPods 4 a review score of 88 last year. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 ($60 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support. They have the same open-style design, so the ANC isn't as effective as what you'd get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds more useful in noisy areas all the same. This pair earned a score of 86 in our review, and the discount matches the lowest price we've tracked. Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weird, flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, they offer most of the conveniences of the in-ear AirPods, while their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market.

It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price.

          "standfirst": "Those on a tight budget and those who prefer open-ear AirPods will want to check out the latest discount on the AirPods 4. Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are down to $89, or 31 percent off their normal rate. That's also the lowest we've seen them, and one of the best Prime Day Apple deals you can still get now that the event is over. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $120 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway. There are plenty of other Apple deals to be had at the moment, and there are a few more worthy AirPods deals we've collected below.

          "standfirst": "Another Prime Day has come and gone, but a few deals are still lingering on the internet today. If you missed the two-day event but still have some shopping to do, you may be in luck. On the tech side of things, you can still save on a number of Apple devices, handy tech under $50 and even some big-ticket items like cordless vacuums. Here, we've gathered the best tech deals you can still get today now that October Prime Day is over. Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but for now, you can get around that by stacking codes. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Google TV Streamer 4K for $80 ($20 off): This is our current favorite streaming device thanks to its attractive design with handy remote and easy-to-use interface that gives you access to all major streaming services. It also puts a smart home control on your TV, so you can easily turn on compatible smart lights, check video feeds of security cameras and more right from your TV. Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $330 (39 percent off): This is a good entry-level Dyson with strong suction power and easy handling. It has a decently sized dustbin and comes with four cleaning attachments, plus it will run up to 40 minutes on a single charge. Prime Day deals: Apple devices Apple iPad A16 for $279 ($70 off): Apple’s entry-level iPad is best for kids, casual users or anyone on a tight budget who still wants a bonafide Apple tablet. It has solid performance, double the base storage compared to previous models, great build quality and a solid battery life. Note, though, that it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Prime Day deals: Tech and gadgets Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): Roku makes some of the best streaming devices available, and this small dongle gives you access to a ton of free content plus all the other streaming services you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. Amazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier TV with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-20-best-prime-day-tech-deals-you-can-still-get-today-050801239.html?src=rss",

Prime Day deals: Apple devices Apple iPad A16 for $279 ($70 off): Apple’s entry-level iPad is best for kids, casual users or anyone on a tight budget who still wants a bonafide Apple tablet. It has solid performance, double the base storage compared to previous models, great build quality and a solid battery life. Note, though, that it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Prime Day deals: Tech and gadgets Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): Roku makes some of the best streaming devices available, and this small dongle gives you access to a ton of free content plus all the other streaming services you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. Amazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier TV with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-20-best-prime-day-tech-deals-you-can-still-get-today-050801239.html?src=rss",

But since the Switch 2 is only compatible with newer microSD Express cards, the pickings are slim at the moment. You can't just buy any microSD card you find at a cheap price — but there are some good deals on microSD Express cards, specifically, right now. The most affordable of the bunch is this 128GB PNY microSD Express card, which is 15 percent off and down to $38. Engadget's Jeff Dunn has been testing microSD Express cards since the Switch 2 launched. The best microSD Express card for Switch 2 at the moment is really the one you can most easily afford. While the cards he's tried out so far didn't perform identically in our benchmark tests, the differences in overall performance and load times will be tough for most people to notice. Thankfully, the ones he's tested so far have been good — there isn't a bad one in the bunch, and while the most consistent performer was the SanDisk microSD Express card, you won't really sacrifice by getting a different one. In fact, at least in the case of these deals, you'll be gaining by saving some cash. PNY's card in particular was actually slightly faster than SanDisk's in our testing when it came to moving games from the card back to the Switch 2's internal storage. However, it was a bit slower in writing games to the card itself. That just means you may wait a few extra minutes before you can open Mario Kart World and get to racing, but for most people, the difference will be negligible. Also on sale are two configurations of Lexar's Play Pro microSD card. The 512GB version is down to $88, while the 1TB model is on sale for $158. That's up to 28 percent off and the lowest we've seen them. If you're hoping to make a one-and-done purchase and you already plan on packing your console with the best Switch 2 games, we'd recommend getting the card with the highest capacity that's still within your budget.

          "standfirst": "Making a good digital picture frame should be easy. All you need is a good screen and an uncomplicated way to get your favorite photos onto the device. Combine that with an inoffensive, frame-like design and you're good to go.Despite that, I can tell you that many digital photo frames are awful. Amazon is positively littered with scads of digital frames and it's basically the 2020s version of what we saw with knock-off iPods back in the 2000s. There are loads of options that draw you in with a low price but deliver a totally subpar experience that will prompt you to shove the thing in a drawer and forget about it.The good news is that you only need to find one smart photo frame that works. From there, you can have a pretty delightful experience. If you're anything like me, you have thousands of photos on your phone of friends, family photos, pets, vacation spots, perhaps some lattes or plates of pasta and much more. Too often, those photos stay siloed on our phones, not shared with others or enjoyed on a larger scale. And sure, I can look at my photos on my laptop or an iPad, but there's something enjoyable about having a dedicated place for these things. After all, there's a reason photo frames exist in the first place, right? A great frame can help you send photos to loved ones and share cherished memories with friends and family effortlessly. I tested out seven smart photo frames to weed through the junk and find the top picks for the best digital frames worth buying. Best digital picture frames for 2025 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality. Digital frames FAQs Are digital photo frames a good idea? Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice. Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere? Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.

          "standfirst": "Sound is a complicated topic in cars. Some cars are good because they're very loud. Some cars are good because they're very quiet. A select few cars can be counted in both categories. Really, only Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N has managed to check both boxes, but if Ferrari's promises about its first EV are to be believed, we may soon have another entrant. At an event at the company's headquarters in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari unveiled the first proper details about its first EV, the Elettrica, which is set to fully debut next year. We're missing a few key details (such as what it looks like), but after spending a day talking to the various engineers behind this machine, I can finally reveal what makes this car move and how it might sound, too. Power is a key metric for any Ferrari, and the Elettrica has plenty of that. Four electric motors, one per wheel, combine to generate a figure somewhere over 1,000 horsepower. That would put it close to the power of the company's new F80 supercar, but in an era of 2,000-hp EVs, the Elettrica's output isn't exactly stunning. This is something even Ferrari's chief product development officer, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, admitted: \"It's very easy and simple to create power in an electric engine. It's not difficult.\" Cornering, he said, is what it's really all about. He called current performance EVs \"elephants,\" capable of going quickly in a straight line but failing miserably at being compelling machines to drive. That's partly why the Elettrica has four motors. That way, the car's traction and stability management systems can modulate power to maximize grip at each tire individually, rather than relying on one or two motors with differentials to try to manage wheelspin.But it goes deeper than that. The Elettrica can also steer each rear wheel independently, more or less on the inside or outside of the turn to help manage (or perhaps even induce) oversteer. The front motors and inverter on the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari Finally, the Elettrica will have active suspension, a novel type that debuted on the Purosangue SUV and is also used on the F80 supercar. Ferrari's dampers replace traditional valves and oil with an electric motor that provides the resistance. This means, again, the damping and ride height of the car can be adjusted independently at each corner, nearly instantly. All that, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said, will result in an EV that drives like none other on the road: \"We want to show that we are able to harness any technology in a unique way.\" Making a compelling EV, a type of car that many decry as too samey, would be a bold way to do it. One key factor to this is a unique sound. Ferrari engineers knew that they needed to come up with some sort of acoustic accompaniment for the Elettrica, but they also knew it had to be authentic. \"We didn't create a fake sound, like a starship or something like that,\" Fulgenzi said. \"We wanted to have exactly the sound of the electric engine.\" Ferrari came up with a solution similar to the one Porsche used for the Taycan, but it executed it in a novel way. In the Taycan, Porsche sampled and remixed the sounds of the car's electrical components. For the Elettrica, Ferrari actually installs an accelerometer inside the casing of the rear electric motors. That sensor picks up the harmonic resonance and runs it through a digital amplifier to create a sound that isn't a sample — it’s actually coming directly from those motors. Fulgenzi likens it to an amp on an electric guitar, picking up the near-inaudible vibration of the strings and turning it into (potentially ear-splitting) sound. That's perhaps a bit aspirational, but the proof of course will be in the listening, something that Ferrari sadly hasn't let me (or anyone else) do just yet. The rear motor and inverter for the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari They're also not showing anyone what the thing looks like, but it seems safe to expect that this machine will bear a shape and design unlike any Ferrari that's come before. That’s because Ferrari is, for the first time, working with design house LoveFrom, better known as the house that Jony Ive built after leaving Apple in 2019 and then sold to OpenAI for $6.5 billion. LoveFrom has worked on a fair few projects since its inception, but this will be the company's first car. Given that, we have absolutely nothing to go on when it comes to visual style. But if I had to guess, I'd say something with a minimalist vibe is on the menu based on Ive's previous work. (And also his own car collection, which features a lot of classic bits of iconic British motoring.) What we do know is that the Elettrica will have four doors and four seats. No, then, this won't be a proper sports car, instead sitting somewhere between grand tourer and SUV. It'll be something designed with a bit of practicality and comfort, able to waft calmly and quietly if you like. Or, with the twist of a few knobs on the steering wheel, it's able to tighten up and get loud when you're feeling more rowdy. With somewhere north of 330 miles of range, it should make for a decent tourer, too. That comes from a 122 kWh (gross) battery pack that's split up into 15 modules, each containing 14 NMC pouch cells. The cells are initially sourced from SK On, but Ferrari made it clear they're not tied to that supplier. Indeed, the company hopes to evolve the battery pack design and chemistry over the years, keeping some version of it available for decades to come. This is, after all, a Ferrari, a machine that ostensibly will just keep getting more valuable as it ages. That, though, is a challenge currently stymying other makers of premium EVs. Can Ferrari make a truly desirable, truly premium EV? Having Jony Ive's name attached certainly doesn't hurt. We'll all have to wait until early next year to see how it looks and how it sounds. I personally won't get too excited about this car until then, but I am very glad that it even exists. Back in 2011, Luca Di Montezemelo, then-CEO of Ferrari, told me that Ferrari would never make an EV. I was skeptical of his statement back then, and 14 years later, I'm glad to see the company finally coming around.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html?src=rss",

This is something even Ferrari's chief product development officer, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, admitted: \"It's very easy and simple to create power in an electric engine. It's not difficult.\" Cornering, he said, is what it's really all about. He called current performance EVs \"elephants,\" capable of going quickly in a straight line but failing miserably at being compelling machines to drive. That's partly why the Elettrica has four motors. That way, the car's traction and stability management systems can modulate power to maximize grip at each tire individually, rather than relying on one or two motors with differentials to try to manage wheelspin.But it goes deeper than that. The Elettrica can also steer each rear wheel independently, more or less on the inside or outside of the turn to help manage (or perhaps even induce) oversteer. The front motors and inverter on the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari Finally, the Elettrica will have active suspension, a novel type that debuted on the Purosangue SUV and is also used on the F80 supercar. Ferrari's dampers replace traditional valves and oil with an electric motor that provides the resistance. This means, again, the damping and ride height of the car can be adjusted independently at each corner, nearly instantly. All that, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said, will result in an EV that drives like none other on the road: \"We want to show that we are able to harness any technology in a unique way.\" Making a compelling EV, a type of car that many decry as too samey, would be a bold way to do it. One key factor to this is a unique sound. Ferrari engineers knew that they needed to come up with some sort of acoustic accompaniment for the Elettrica, but they also knew it had to be authentic. \"We didn't create a fake sound, like a starship or something like that,\" Fulgenzi said. \"We wanted to have exactly the sound of the electric engine.\" Ferrari came up with a solution similar to the one Porsche used for the Taycan, but it executed it in a novel way. In the Taycan, Porsche sampled and remixed the sounds of the car's electrical components. For the Elettrica, Ferrari actually installs an accelerometer inside the casing of the rear electric motors. That sensor picks up the harmonic resonance and runs it through a digital amplifier to create a sound that isn't a sample — it’s actually coming directly from those motors. Fulgenzi likens it to an amp on an electric guitar, picking up the near-inaudible vibration of the strings and turning it into (potentially ear-splitting) sound. That's perhaps a bit aspirational, but the proof of course will be in the listening, something that Ferrari sadly hasn't let me (or anyone else) do just yet. The rear motor and inverter for the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari They're also not showing anyone what the thing looks like, but it seems safe to expect that this machine will bear a shape and design unlike any Ferrari that's come before. That’s because Ferrari is, for the first time, working with design house LoveFrom, better known as the house that Jony Ive built after leaving Apple in 2019 and then sold to OpenAI for $6.5 billion. LoveFrom has worked on a fair few projects since its inception, but this will be the company's first car. Given that, we have absolutely nothing to go on when it comes to visual style. But if I had to guess, I'd say something with a minimalist vibe is on the menu based on Ive's previous work. (And also his own car collection, which features a lot of classic bits of iconic British motoring.) What we do know is that the Elettrica will have four doors and four seats. No, then, this won't be a proper sports car, instead sitting somewhere between grand tourer and SUV. It'll be something designed with a bit of practicality and comfort, able to waft calmly and quietly if you like. Or, with the twist of a few knobs on the steering wheel, it's able to tighten up and get loud when you're feeling more rowdy. With somewhere north of 330 miles of range, it should make for a decent tourer, too. That comes from a 122 kWh (gross) battery pack that's split up into 15 modules, each containing 14 NMC pouch cells. The cells are initially sourced from SK On, but Ferrari made it clear they're not tied to that supplier. Indeed, the company hopes to evolve the battery pack design and chemistry over the years, keeping some version of it available for decades to come. This is, after all, a Ferrari, a machine that ostensibly will just keep getting more valuable as it ages. That, though, is a challenge currently stymying other makers of premium EVs. Can Ferrari make a truly desirable, truly premium EV? Having Jony Ive's name attached certainly doesn't hurt. We'll all have to wait until early next year to see how it looks and how it sounds. I personally won't get too excited about this car until then, but I am very glad that it even exists. Back in 2011, Luca Di Montezemelo, then-CEO of Ferrari, told me that Ferrari would never make an EV. I was skeptical of his statement back then, and 14 years later, I'm glad to see the company finally coming around.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Streaming services keep raising prices. At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty. Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Hulu + Live TV (three months) for $195 ($54 off): New and eligible returning subscribers can get three months of Hulu + Live TV at a rate of $65 per month, which is much cheaper than the standard $83-per-month rate. In addition to live TV content, this service also includes Disney+ and ESPN Select, so you're essentially getting three separate streaming services under this umbrella. We consider that to be Hulu + Live TV's edge, and we named it one of the best live TV streaming services on the market right now. The offer runs through October 23. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. YouTube TV (three months) for $219 ($30 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. DashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more. Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Also, it's worth noting that anything Disney-related will be getting a price hike soon. As of October 21, 2025, you'll pay more for Disney+, Hulu and most associated bundles. But if you subscribe now, you'll at least pay one month at the old, cheaper rate. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.

          "title": "The most important OpenAI announcement you probably missed at DevDay 2025",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI’s annual developer conference on Monday was a spectacle of ambitious AI product launches, from an app store for ChatGPT to a stunning video-generation API that brought creative concepts to life. But for the enterprises and technical leaders watching closely, the most consequential announcement was the quiet general availability of Codex, the company&#x27;s AI software engineer. This release signals a profound shift in how software—and by extension, modern business—is built.While other announcements captured the public’s imagination, the production-ready release of Codex, supercharged by a new specialized model and a suite of enterprise-grade tools, is the engine behind OpenAI’s entire vision. It is the tool that builds the tools, the proven agent in a world buzzing with agentic potential, and the clearest articulation of the company&#x27;s strategy to win the enterprise.The general availability of Codex moves it from a \"research preview\" to a fully supported product, complete with a new software development kit (SDK), a Slack integration, and administrative controls for security and monitoring.This transition declares that Codex is ready for mission-critical work inside the world’s largest companies.\"We think this is the best time in history to be a builder; it has never been faster to go from idea to product,\" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during the opening keynote presentation. \"Software used to take months or years to build. You saw that it can take minutes now to build with AI.\" That acceleration is not theoretical. It&#x27;s a reality born from OpenAI’s own internal use — a massive \"dogfooding\" effort that serves as the ultimate case study for enterprise customers.Inside GPT-5-Codex: The AI model that codes autonomously for hours and drives 70% productivity gainsAt the heart of the Codex upgrade is GPT-5-Codex, a version of OpenAI&#x27;s latest flagship model that has been \"purposely trained for Codex and agentic coding.\" The new model is designed to function as an autonomous teammate, moving far beyond simple code autocompletion.\"I personally like to think about it as a little bit like a human teammate,\" explained Tibo Sottiaux, an OpenAI engineer, during a technical session on Codex. \"You can pair a program with it on your computer, you can delegate to it, or as you&#x27;ll see, you can give it a job without explicit prompting.\"This new model enables \"adaptive thinking,\" allowing it to dynamically adjust the time and computational effort spent on a task based on its complexity.For simple requests, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, but for complex refactoring projects, it can work for hours.One engineer during the technical session noted, \"I&#x27;ve seen the GPT-5-Codex model work for over seven hours productively... on a marathon session.\" This capability to handle long-running, complex tasks is a significant leap beyond the simple, single-shot interactions that define most AI coding assistants.The results inside OpenAI have been dramatic. The company reported that 92% of its technical staff now uses Codex daily, and those engineers complete 70% more pull requests (a measure of code contribution) each week. Usage has surged tenfold since August. \"When we as a team see the stats, it feels great,\" Sottiaux shared. \"But even better is being at lunch with someone who then goes &#x27;Hey I use Codex all the time. Here&#x27;s a cool thing that I do with it. Do you want to hear about it?&#x27;\" How OpenAI uses Codex to build its own AI products and catch hundreds of bugs dailyPerhaps the most compelling argument for Codex’s importance is that it is the foundational layer upon which OpenAI’s other flashy announcements were built. During the DevDay event, the company showcased custom-built arcade games and a dynamic, AI-powered website for the conference itself, all developed using Codex.In one session, engineers demonstrated how they built \"Storyboard,\" a custom creative tool for the film industry, in just 48 hours during an internal hackathon. \"We decided to test Codex, our coding agent... we would send tasks to Codex in between meetings. We really easily reviewed and merged PRs into production, which Codex even allowed us to do from our phones,\" said Allison August, a solutions engineering leader at OpenAI. This reveals a critical insight: the rapid innovation showcased at DevDay is a direct result of the productivity flywheel created by Codex.

          "content": "OpenAI’s annual developer conference on Monday was a spectacle of ambitious AI product launches, from an app store for ChatGPT to a stunning video-generation API that brought creative concepts to life. But for the enterprises and technical leaders watching closely, the most consequential announcement was the quiet general availability of Codex, the company&#x27;s AI software engineer. This release signals a profound shift in how software—and by extension, modern business—is built.While other announcements captured the public’s imagination, the production-ready release of Codex, supercharged by a new specialized model and a suite of enterprise-grade tools, is the engine behind OpenAI’s entire vision. It is the tool that builds the tools, the proven agent in a world buzzing with agentic potential, and the clearest articulation of the company&#x27;s strategy to win the enterprise.The general availability of Codex moves it from a \"research preview\" to a fully supported product, complete with a new software development kit (SDK), a Slack integration, and administrative controls for security and monitoring.This transition declares that Codex is ready for mission-critical work inside the world’s largest companies.\"We think this is the best time in history to be a builder; it has never been faster to go from idea to product,\" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during the opening keynote presentation. \"Software used to take months or years to build. You saw that it can take minutes now to build with AI.\" That acceleration is not theoretical. It&#x27;s a reality born from OpenAI’s own internal use — a massive \"dogfooding\" effort that serves as the ultimate case study for enterprise customers.Inside GPT-5-Codex: The AI model that codes autonomously for hours and drives 70% productivity gainsAt the heart of the Codex upgrade is GPT-5-Codex, a version of OpenAI&#x27;s latest flagship model that has been \"purposely trained for Codex and agentic coding.\" The new model is designed to function as an autonomous teammate, moving far beyond simple code autocompletion.\"I personally like to think about it as a little bit like a human teammate,\" explained Tibo Sottiaux, an OpenAI engineer, during a technical session on Codex. \"You can pair a program with it on your computer, you can delegate to it, or as you&#x27;ll see, you can give it a job without explicit prompting.\"This new model enables \"adaptive thinking,\" allowing it to dynamically adjust the time and computational effort spent on a task based on its complexity.For simple requests, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, but for complex refactoring projects, it can work for hours.One engineer during the technical session noted, \"I&#x27;ve seen the GPT-5-Codex model work for over seven hours productively... on a marathon session.\" This capability to handle long-running, complex tasks is a significant leap beyond the simple, single-shot interactions that define most AI coding assistants.The results inside OpenAI have been dramatic. The company reported that 92% of its technical staff now uses Codex daily, and those engineers complete 70% more pull requests (a measure of code contribution) each week. Usage has surged tenfold since August. \"When we as a team see the stats, it feels great,\" Sottiaux shared. \"But even better is being at lunch with someone who then goes &#x27;Hey I use Codex all the time. Here&#x27;s a cool thing that I do with it. Do you want to hear about it?&#x27;\" How OpenAI uses Codex to build its own AI products and catch hundreds of bugs dailyPerhaps the most compelling argument for Codex’s importance is that it is the foundational layer upon which OpenAI’s other flashy announcements were built. During the DevDay event, the company showcased custom-built arcade games and a dynamic, AI-powered website for the conference itself, all developed using Codex.In one session, engineers demonstrated how they built \"Storyboard,\" a custom creative tool for the film industry, in just 48 hours during an internal hackathon. \"We decided to test Codex, our coding agent... we would send tasks to Codex in between meetings. We really easily reviewed and merged PRs into production, which Codex even allowed us to do from our phones,\" said Allison August, a solutions engineering leader at OpenAI. This reveals a critical insight: the rapid innovation showcased at DevDay is a direct result of the productivity flywheel created by Codex. The AI is a core part of the manufacturing process for all other AI products.A key enterprise-focused feature is the new, more robust code review capability.

          "standfirst": "Presented by CertiniaEvery professional services leader knows the feeling: a pipeline full of promising deals, but a bench that’s already stretched thin. That’s because growth has always been tied to a finite supply of consultants with finite availability to work on projects. Even with strong market demand, most firms only capture 10-20% of their potential pipeline because they simply can’t staff the work fast enough. Professional Services Automation (PSA) software emerged to help optimize operations, but the core model has remained the same.Thankfully, that limitation is about to change. The proliferation of AI agents is sparking a new model — Autonomous PSA — blending human expertise with a digital workforce, all managed by a central orchestration engine. The result is a system that allows firms to capture 70-90% of demand instead of leaving it on the table. Why professional services has the biggest transformation opportunity with agentic AIMany industries will be transformed by AI agents, but perhaps none more than professional services. Understanding why requires us to explore the difference between current-state automation and future-state autonomy.Traditional automation follows pre-set rules: When X happens, do Y. It&#x27;s a logical workflow. Autonomy, on the other hand, is goal-oriented: The goal is Z. Analyze the data, select and deploy the best resources, and execute the necessary steps to achieve Z. It’s the difference between executing a workflow, and executing a full-on strategy.This distinction is key because the core operation of a professional services business is a complex strategy. Unlike a sales team managing a linear pipeline or a support team clearing a reactive queue, a services firm is constantly solving a multi-dimensional problem. The \"product\" isn&#x27;t a license or a physical item; it&#x27;s the expertise of its people, working on a diverse set of tasks, typically delivered over discrete units of time.That means the business model of a services organization contains layers of operational complexity that product-based businesses inherently get to avoid. The manual effort and guesswork involved often lead to conservative bidding on new business, underutilized experts, and reactive staffing that can put project margins and timelines at risk. Added up, this complexity represents a trillion-dollar opportunity cost for the global services economy.The orchestration engine that makes autonomous PSA possible“Autonomous PSA” describes an intelligent system designed to manage and orchestrate a blended team of human experts and their AI agent counterparts. It works by integrating a digital workforce of AI agents directly into your service delivery operations, providing a nearly limitless supply of labor for repeatable tasks, all governed by a single engine. It&#x27;s a fundamental shift from a model constrained by human supply to one amplified by digital scale.There is one enterprise software ecosystem uniquely positioned to make Autonomous PSA possible: Salesforce. Autonomous PSA emerges from the combination of three of its core technologies:The Salesforce platform as the foundation: Everything will start with a single source of truth. The Salesforce platform provides the unified data fabric for every aspect of the customer relationship. This foundation extends across the entire platform, giving the autonomous engine the complete data context it needs to function. Agentforce as the AI engine: Agentforce represents the industry’s most secure, trusted layer for building and deploying AI agents that provide digital labor. It gives organizations the power to execute complex tasks at scale, transforming AI capabilities from concept to a tangible part of the future resource pool. Salesforce-native Professional Services Automation software as the orchestration brain: The data foundation and AI engine need a command center. A Salesforce-native solution for Professional Services Automation like Certinia acts as the orchestration brain that defines the goals, rules, and workflows for the agents, deploying them alongside human resources to optimize project outcomes from sale to delivery.The keystone of this new model is the orchestration brain, akin to a control tower for the hybrid human-AI agent workforce. It’s a system built to manage an elastic supply of resources, instantly scaling delivery by pairing consultants with digital agents. Instead of scrambling with spreadsheets, staffing becomes a real-time, AI-driven allocation based on skills, availability, and project needs.The combination creates a unified platform that gives the orchestration engine the context it needs for smarter, faster decision-making across the entire project lifecycle.For executives, the impact is direct. Now empowered to overcome human capacity limits, PSOs can expand pipeline capture from a mere 10–20% to as high as 70–90%. This growth is also more profitable, as margins improve when lower-value work is offloaded to digital labor, allowing people to focus on high-value delivery. Furthermore, project timelines are accelerated, with 24/7 AI capacity shortening schedules and speeding time-to-value. Crucially, this speed and efficiency do not come at the expense of quality; human oversight remains embedded in every engagement, ensuring client trust is maintained through strong governance.Preparing your organization for autonomous PSAAdapting to Autonomous Professional Services requires leadership and foresight. For organizations ready to start, the journey begins with three key steps:Re-architect your workforce model. The traditional pyramid workforce hierarchy is shifting to a diamond structure with AI agents handling the base of repeatable work. This will create new roles like orchestration analysts and agent supervisors to manage this blended workforce. Your first move is to audit your delivery processes and identify the high-volume, low-complexity tasks primed for this new digital workforce.Invest in a native orchestration engine. An autonomous system needs a central brain. This is your PSA solution, and it must be native to your CRM platform to access real-time data across sales, service, and finance. If your project, resource, and financial data live in different systems, your priority is to unify them on a single platform to create the foundation for intelligent decision-making.Experiment, then scale. Don&#x27;t try to transform everything at once. Start by automating a single, high-friction process, like project creation from a closed-won opportunity or initial budget drafting. Proving value on a small scale builds the business case and the operational muscle for a systematic expansion across your entire services lifecycle.Model behind the trillion-dollar ppportunity Our analysis from over 2000 global professional services organizations indicates that firms today leave most of their pipeline untouched. With human capacity alone, they typically capture only 10–20% of qualified demand. By blending digital labor into the mix, that capacity can rise to 70–90%. The difference—what we call ΔR—is massive. For a large professional services organization (PSO) with a $6B pipeline, that shift alone unlocks about $3.6B in incremental revenue.And that is just the starting point. Once you add amplifiers like faster delivery (acceleration), lower delivery cost (margin gains), and access to niche expertise (skill-gap coverage), the impact multiplies. In our model, those amplifiers nearly triple the base gain, raising the total opportunity to $10 Billion per firm. Scale that across 100 of the world’s largest PSOs, and you arrive at the trillion-dollar prize.Seize the full market potentialThe idea presented here represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the economics of professional services. Firms that adopt Autonomous PSA will capture a greater share of demand, deliver faster outcomes, and free their experts to focus on what matters most: client success.The era of Autonomous Professional Services has begun. The orchestration engine is the key. How quickly will your organization seize the opportunity?The full framework and analytical model are detailed in this new white paper, Unlocking a Trillion Dollar Opportunity for Professional Services with Autonomous PSA.

          "standfirst": "The friction of having to open a separate chat window to prompt an agent could be a hassle for many enterprises. And AI companies are seeing an opportunity to bring more and more AI services into one platform, even integrating into where employees do their work. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, although still a separate window, is gradually introducing more integrations into its platform. Rivals like Google and Amazon Web Services believe they can compete with new platforms directly aiming at enterprise users who want a more streamlined AI experience. And these two new platforms are the latest volley in the race to bring enterprise AI users into one central place for their AI needs. Google and AWS are separately introducing new platforms designed for full-stack agent workflow, hoping to usher in a world where users don’t need to open other windows to access agents. Google unveiled Gemini Enterprise, a platform that Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said “brings the best of Google AI to every employee.” Meanwhile, AWS announced Quick Suite, a series of services intended to exist as a browser extension for enterprises to call on agents. Both these platforms aim to keep enterprise employees working within one ecosystem, keeping the needed context in more local storage. Quick SuiteAWS, through Bedrock, allowed enterprises to build applications and agents, test them, and then deploy them in a single space. However, Bedrock remains a backend tool. AWS is banking that organizations will want a better way to access those agents without leaving their workspace. Quick Suite will be AWS’s front-facing agentic application for enterprises. It will also be a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox and accessible on Microsoft Outlook, Word and Slack. AWS vice president for Agentic AI Swami Sivasubramanian said Quick Suite is the company’s way of “entering a new era of work,” in that it gives employees access to AI applications they like with privacy considerations and context from their enterprise data. Quick Suite connects with Adobe Analytics, SharePoint, Snowflake, Google Drive, OneDrive, Outlook, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Databricks, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. Through MCP servers, users can also access information from Atlassian, Asana, Box, Canva, PagerDuty, Workato or Zapier. The platform consists of several services users can toggle to:An agent builder accessible through a chat assistant Quick Sight to analyze and visualize dataQuick Research, which can find information and build out research reports. Users can choose to limit the search to internal or uploaded documents only or to access the internetQuick Flows to allow people to build routine tasks through simple promptsQuick Automate for more complicated workflows, where the model can begin coordinating agents and data sharing to complete tasksAWS said it orchestrates through several foundation models to power Quick Suite’s services. Gemini EnterpriseGoogle had already begun offering enterprise AI solutions, often in fragmented products. Its newest offering, Gemini Enterprise, brings together the company’s AI offerings in a single place. Products like Gemini CLI and Google Vids will be integrated and accessible through Gemini Enterprise. “By bringing all of these components together through a single interface, Gemini Enterprise transforms how teams work,” Kurian said in a blog post.It is powered by Gemini models and connects to an enterprise’s data sources. Gemini always connected to Google’s Workspace services, such as Docs and Drive, but Gemini Enterprise can now grab information from Microsoft 365 or other platforms like Salesforce. The idea behind Gemini Enterprise is to offer “a no-code workbench” for any user to surface information and orchestrate agents for automation. The platform includes pre-built agents for deep research and insights, but customers can also bring in their own or third-party agents. Administrators can manage these agents and workflows through a visual governance framework within Gemini Enterprise. Google said some customers have already begun using Gemini Enterprise, including Macquarie Bank, legal AI provider Harvey and Banco BV. Google told VentureBeat that other platforms, like Vertex AI, remain separate products. Pricing for Gemini Enterprise, both the standard and pulse editions, start at $30 per seat per month. A new pricing tier, Gemini Business, costs $21/seat per month for a year. Uninterrupted work in one placeIn many ways, enterprise AI was always going to move to this more full-stack, end-to-end environment where people access all AI tools in one place. After all, fragmented offerings and lost context turn off many employees who already have a lot on their plates. Removing the friction of moving windows and possibly losing context to what you’re working on could save people a lot more time, and make the idea of using an AI agent or chatbot more appealing. This was the reasoning behind OpenAI’s decision to create a desktop app for ChatGPT and why we see so many product announcements around integrations. But now, competitors have to offer more differentiated platforms or they risk being labeled as copycats of products most people already use. I felt the same during a Quick Suite demo, thinking it felt like ChatGPT. The battle to be the one full-stack platform for the enterprise is just beginning. And as more AI tools and agents become more useful for employees, there will be more demand to make calling up these services as simple as a tap from their preferred workspace.",

Uninterrupted work in one placeIn many ways, enterprise AI was always going to move to this more full-stack, end-to-end environment where people access all AI tools in one place. After all, fragmented offerings and lost context turn off many employees who already have a lot on their plates. Removing the friction of moving windows and possibly losing context to what you’re working on could save people a lot more time, and make the idea of using an AI agent or chatbot more appealing. This was the reasoning behind OpenAI’s decision to create a desktop app for ChatGPT and why we see so many product announcements around integrations. But now, competitors have to offer more differentiated platforms or they risk being labeled as copycats of products most people already use. I felt the same during a Quick Suite demo, thinking it felt like ChatGPT. The battle to be the one full-stack platform for the enterprise is just beginning. And as more AI tools and agents become more useful for employees, there will be more demand to make calling up these services as simple as a tap from their preferred workspace.",

          "standfirst": "Presented by ZendeskZendesk powers nearly 5 billion resolutions every year for over 100,000 customers around the world, with about 20,000 of its customers (and growing) using its AI services. Zendesk is poised to generate about $200 million in AI-related revenue this year, double than some of its largest competitors, while investing $400 million dollars in R&D. Much of that research is focused on upgrading the Zendesk Resolution Platform, a complete AI-first solution for customer service, employee service, and contact center teams, announced at Relate this past March.During AI Summit, Chief Executive Officer Tom Eggemeier, along with members of the Zendesk team, took to the stage to announce several major advancements, including voice AI agents, video calling, and screen sharing for Zendesk Contact Center, and improved IT asset management, as well as the introduction of next-generation analytics, in the wake of its acquisition of HyperArc.\"We have built the only platform that is purpose-built for service and purpose-built for AI,\" Eggemeier said. \"That focus is why we lead in AI for all types of service. And it is why we can deliver what no one else can for every service need you have in your organization.\"New capabilities across use cases and companiesAt its core, the Resolution Platform powers autonomous AI agents that solve complex issues in real time, leveraging leading LLMs like GPT-5, developed in collaboration with OpenAI, and supporting Model Context Protocol (MCP) to instantly access data, which streamlines workflows and improves autonomous problem-solving. \"Since our launch in March, we’ve been building fast, focused on making AI agents smarter, more flexible, and ready for even more channels,\" said Shashi Upadhyay, president of product, engineering, and AI at Zendesk. \"And now, these AI agents are getting even better. They work across messaging, email, and now voice. They are getting smarter; able to handle multiple intents in a single message, detecting, remembering, and resolving many issues at once.\"The only platform with native built-in QA, resolutions are automatically scored down to the conversation level, so teams can track resolution quality at scale. For startups, these insights are critical. They not only show what worked, but what needs fixing before it costs them time, reputation, or growth, and importantly, fit within a startup budget. That’s because Zendesk is the only company that charges only for successful resolutions, which are verified through the industry’s longest validation window, with two layers of quality checks.Making the product CX admin a hero Zendesk demonstrated the platform’s new features by highlighting a hypothetical wearable device company’s product launch. Service leaders at every stop along the product launch journey — from design to manufacturing — manage emerging issues with the support of the upgraded Resolution Platform.For a global manufacturer that builds complex, state-of-the-art wearable tech, the pressure starts the moment a new product hits the market, tickets start pouring in, and a red-flagged backlog piles up. \"It is not a product issue, it is a resolution bottleneck,\" Upadhyay said. But, he added, \"What once took days can now be resolved instantly.\" The new Zendesk Admin Copilot is designed specifically to assist human agents, helping them spot what is not working, what to do next, and carry out changes quickly. It flags operational issues, like missing intent tags, broken internal processes, or routing conflicts that delay resolution. Copilot explains what is happening in plain language, recommends specific fixes, and with the admin’s approval, can make the changes itself. It&#x27;s grounded in live Zendesk data, like tickets, triggers, and knowledge, so every recommendation is specific, current, and based on how the service operation actually runs. Once the admin identifies the issue and implements a fix, the next step is ensuring everyone has access to the right knowledge to support it. For many organizations, that information lives outside of Zendesk. The newly launched Knowledge Connectors allows admins to pull in relevant content, like configuration guides or policy details, without needing to migrate anything so both human and AI agents have access to real-time instructions tied to the exact product version. The admin also creates a smarter feedback loop with the new Action Builder, which automatically tags, summarizes, and sends notifications to the product team through Microsoft Teams. And finally, Zendesk HyperArc will bring customers insights that combine AI and human analysis in a clear, narrative-driven view of what is happening and why, instead of siloed dashboards or static reports.\"With these innovations in place, change at the manufacturing plant cascades quickly, tickets are routed cleanly, support agents know what to say, engineering sees real signals instead of scattered anecdotes, and customers who just want the product to work get fast, reliable resolutions,\" Upadhyay said. \"The CX Admin becomes the quiet hero of the manufacturer’s story.\"Solutions for the retail CX leaderAs a CX or contact center leader for a retail company, when a must-have wearable drops, how do you deliver service for your new hit product that feels personal and consistent when your team is stretched across multiple countries, channels, and customer expectations at once? \"Intelligent automation doesn’t just streamline operations — it enhances the customer experience across borders and channels,\" said Lisa Kant, senior vice president of marketing at Zendesk. Zendesk’s Voice AI Agents are fully autonomous AI agents designed to understand natural speech, take action, and resolve issues without needing to escalate. They can verify identity, track orders, update deliveries, and answer setup questions in multiple languages, while keeping the brand experience consistent. Meanwhile, Video Calling lets a live agent spin up a video session, confirm the device is working, and walk the customer through setup or troubleshooting. And because a help center is a critical part of delivering great service, especially when scaling fast across multiple countries and languages, Zendesk built Knowledge Builder, an AI-powered tool that helps teams build and maintain their help center content automatically. It analyzes real customer conversations and turns them into localized help articles for trending issues.Giving IT leaders a strong edge When a company adopts that new product, it becomes critical to resolve issues fast, to ensure employee productivity stays strong. Available with early access in November, Zendesk&#x27;s new employee service offering, IT Asset Management (ITAM), natively integrates service and asset data together into the Zendesk service desk to help IT move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive service. Now, when a vague “tablet not working” ticket comes in, Zendesk ITAM surfaces the device details right inside the ticket, so IT knows exactly what they are dealing with. Zendesk Copilot uses that same asset data to recommend model-specific troubleshooting steps. And with Knowledge Connectors, those steps can be pulled directly from SharePoint or Confluence without migration. If the fix does not work, the IT specialist confirms in seconds that the device is under warranty and issues a replacement without any back-and-forth. With real-time visibility across every hardware asset, the IT leader can spot patterns before they become a flood of tickets, or failures at the point of care, so IT resolves issues faster and prevents problems before they happen. \"With Zendesk, IT is not just reacting to issues — it is setting the standard for how proactive employee service is delivered,\" Upadhyay said.For more on the latest Zendesk updates and improvements, and to watch a conversation with Zendesk&#x27;s special guest, co-founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, and more, watch the full videos here.

          "title": "Prime Day speaker deals are still available: Save on JBL, Bose, Ultimate Ears and more",
          "standfirst": "Amazon Prime Day is nearly over, but our audio experts are still sifting through Amazon for bargains on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable blueetooth speakers. We're always ready to argue this high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to any kind of entertainment — and with these deals on top speakers from JBL, Bose, Beats, Marshall and more, there's no excuse not to upgrade. Whether you're building a permanent setup for your home theater or chaining portable speakers together to blast dance tunes through an outdoor party venue, we bet you'll find some deals to love on this curated list. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $150 (17 percent off): This deal is a great way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love. An Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Flip 6 for $100 (23 percent off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $35 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Beats Pill for $119 (34 percent off): This Bluetooth speaker from Apple subsidiary Beats earned a score of 83 in our review and currently holds a spot in our buying guide. It’s not the best raw value on the market, and it can struggle at maximum volume, but it generally pumps out strong bass without sounding imbalanced. A stylish and water-resistant design, ample battery life and the ability to play lossless audio over a USB-C cable add to the appeal. This sizable discount matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Marshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): Marshall recently re-engineered the Acton's speaker setup by angling the tweeters outward. It paid off, especially in the Acton III, which now delivers a pleasingly wide soundscape. At 6.3 pounts, it's not technically portable, but the design makes it easy to move around — and for the eco-conscious, it's made of 70 percent recycled materials. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for. Sonos Era 100 for $180 (10 percent off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 (29 percent off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Marshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): Marshall recently re-engineered the Acton's speaker setup by angling the tweeters outward. It paid off, especially in the Acton III, which now delivers a pleasingly wide soundscape. At 6.3 pounts, it's not technically portable, but the design makes it easy to move around — and for the eco-conscious, it's made of 70 percent recycled materials. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for. Sonos Era 100 for $180 (10 percent off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 (29 percent off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale tends to be a decent source of discounts for gaming gear, and the latest iteration of the “Prime Big Deal Days” event is no exception. Several games, mice, controllers and other accessories we like remain on sale as we approach the end of the two-day event, so if you just can’t wait until Black Friday, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day deals on gaming devices below. Just remember that you need to be a Prime member to access some of the offers, and that the event as a whole ends at 3AM ET on October 9. Best Prime Day video game deals Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off MSRP): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version. Metaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy. Madden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to. Best Prime Day gaming device deals Astro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off): The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low. Keychron Q3 Max mechanical keyboard for $195 ($35 off): The Keychron Q Max series is the top pick in our guide to the best mechanical keyboards, pairing an upscale (if heavy) aluminum case with a lovely typing experience and extensive customizability. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve ever seen for the tenkeyless model, but it’s a rare drop from the board’s typical street price. Other size layouts are discounted as well. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March. ASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches. PNY microSD Express Card (128GB) for $38 ($7 off): We generally recommend getting at least 256GB of storage from your Switch 2 microSD card, since recent games can fill up that space pretty quickly. But if you only want a little bit extra, this is the lowest price we’ve seen for PNY’s 128GB model. Just note that this card is technically the slowest we've tested when it came to moving games to the card from the Switch’s internal storage, though it's perfectly fine for in-game tasks. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X/S (2TB) for $190 ($170 off): It’s annoying, but the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X/S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Seagate’s model is one of the very few examples of those, and this discount marks the lowest price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant in the past year. Yes, it’s still overpriced compared to a normal SSD, but any extra savings should be welcome. Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale. Crucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-that-are-still-available-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623683.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best Amazon Prime Day deals on Kindles, Echo speakers, Fire TV devices and more for Day 2",
          "standfirst": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, October Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have been the same or even better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For October Prime Day, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best October Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more before the sale ends tonight. Prime Day Kindle deals Kindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate. Kindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration. Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life. Kindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. Prime Day Echo deals Echo Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. Echo Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy. Echo Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals. Echo Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services. Prime Day Fire TV deals Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie. Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something. Fire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console. Prime Day Fire tablet deals Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more. Fire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case. Fire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case. Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-on-kindles-echo-speakers-fire-tv-devices-and-more-for-day-2-081210482.html?src=rss",

It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. Prime Day Echo deals Echo Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system.

          "standfirst": "It's the final day of Amazon Prime Day, but it's not too late to get a heavy discount on a traditional or robotic vacuums from Amazon. We're hoping this sale helps ease some of the more granular vacuum-related decisions. Should you go corded, cordless or robotic? Dyson, iRobot or Shark? Are there any decent robotic vacuums that aren't Roombas? (Yes.) Until the very end of the Big Deal Days sale tonight, but until the very end, we'll search for discounts as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best deals here. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Dreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (49 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Roborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 (35 percent off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet. Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 (31 percent off): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 (8 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 (35 percent off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 (37 percent off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed. Eureka Stylus Elite NEC490BL Cordless Stick Vacuum for $190 (32 percent off): Another extremely strong entry into the field of budget-friendly cordless vacuums, the Eureka Stylus Elite comes with its own self-emptying station — just plug the holding tank into the stand, and the mechanism does the rest. It also includes an anti-tangle brush roll, five layers of HEPA filtration and three modes that let you decide whether to prioritize power or battery charge length.

          "standfirst": "While Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale has been a good opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. We're into the second and final day of the \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event, but several well-reviewed sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other name brands remain at or near their lowest prices to date. We’ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals that are still available below, along with a few choice discounts on streaming devices we like. Just remember that some deals are exclusive to Prime subscribers. Best Prime Day 4K TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,373 ($1,309 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. You should see the full discount at checkout. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Sony Bravia 9 75-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): The Bravia 9 is Sony’s flagship mini-LED TV. It’s pricier than many OLED TVs, but most reviews say that it produces better contrast and black levels than the vast majority of non-OLED sets, with minimal light bloom around bright objects onscreen. So it’s still a strong performer in a dark room. Like the best LCD TVs, it can also get super bright, and it delivers the excellent upscaling and image processing that high-end Sony TVs are known for, so it should make old DVDs and lower-quality streams look their best. That said, the top OLED TVs still have it beat when it comes to contrast, color volume and viewing angles. It’s also not the best choice for gaming, since it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports and has slightly higher input lag than other models. But if money is no object and you don’t want to go OLED, it should satisfy. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 75-inch version. Best Prime Day streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Roku Ultra for $69 ($31 off): You’d buy the Roku Ultra if you want the Roku interface in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the company’s streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finder tool and backlit buttons. (You can buy that separately, though.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support. This deal ties an all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-still-available-on-day-2-take-up-to-500-off-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051817.html?src=rss",
          "content": "While Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale has been a good opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. We're into the second and final day of the \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event, but several well-reviewed sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other name brands remain at or near their lowest prices to date. We’ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals that are still available below, along with a few choice discounts on streaming devices we like. Just remember that some deals are exclusive to Prime subscribers. Best Prime Day 4K TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,373 ($1,309 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. You should see the full discount at checkout. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display.

Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Sony Bravia 9 75-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): The Bravia 9 is Sony’s flagship mini-LED TV. It’s pricier than many OLED TVs, but most reviews say that it produces better contrast and black levels than the vast majority of non-OLED sets, with minimal light bloom around bright objects onscreen. So it’s still a strong performer in a dark room. Like the best LCD TVs, it can also get super bright, and it delivers the excellent upscaling and image processing that high-end Sony TVs are known for, so it should make old DVDs and lower-quality streams look their best.

          "standfirst": "This year's fall Prime Day is almost on the books. But you still have time to save on some of our favorite tech. Yes, it's October and it's a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping. But it would be remiss to ignore the upcoming festivities entirely because you can actually save some money on good gadgets during this sale. But let's be real: Amazon doesn't always make it easy to find what you're looking for. Amongst the pages and pages of bad deals you could sift through, you may come across a couple of actually good deals on tech that's worth your money to begin with. You don't have to go sifting through that nonsense though — that's where we come in. We've curated the top ten Prime Day deals on tech you should shop for before the event ends tonight. And no, not all of them will cost you an arm and a leg. Apple AirTag (four-pack) for $65 (34 percent off): If you're an iPhone user, there are really no better Bluetooth trackers than AirTags. Attach one to your keys with an AirTag holder, slip one into your wallet or throw one into the bottom of your carry-on suitcase to monitor the location of your belongings using the Find My app. As is usually the case, picking them up in a multi-pack like this is cheaper than buying just one AirTag alone. And while you're at it, you can pick up a pair of Belkin AirTag holders for less thanks to Prime Day deals, too. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. PNY microSD Express card (128GB) for $38 (15 percent off): This is really the first time we've seen Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards on sale since they started coming out in earnest earlier this year. No, you unfortunately cannot just buy any microSD card on the market and use it with your new Switch 2. The console only works with these newer cards, and thankfully they are more available now than they were back in April when the Switch 2 went on pre-order for the first time. We've tested a good number of the cards on the market today and found that they're all pretty solid, so the best microSD card for Switch 2 is the microSD Express card you can most easily afford. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. In our DJI Neo review, we praised it for its speediness and general ease of use, even for folks who have never operated a drone before. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Anker Nano portable charger (5K) with built-in USB connector for $20 ($10 off): Small? Check. Easy to use? Check. No need to remember a cable? Check. We tested this one for our battery guide and found it to be a good option for anyone who wants a no-fuss (and very compact) way to power up their phone on the go. It works particularly well with the latest iPhones, but it also works with other gear that carry USB-C charging ports. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. I bought the old version not too long ago, and it's become one of the most used pieces of tech in my house. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K 100W) for $90 ($45 off): This might be the only power bank you need if you're a commuter or you travel often. It's one of our favorites because it has a high enough capacity and wattage to power laptops (as its name suggests), and it has two built-in USB-C cables: one attached to the side, and a retractable one that extends up to two feet. That means you don't have to remember to bring a cable with you in your kit. It also has a handy display that shows the amount of charge the battery still has, and the output wattage flowing to your devices. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Plus, if you're not on the market for a new TV, it's also a good way to make an old set feel new again. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but you can get around that by stacking codes — at least, for now. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Amazon's even offering a small discount on the typical $60 price. Shark AI robot vacuum with self-empty base for $230 (58 percent off): A version of one of our favorite robot vacuums, this Shark machine has strong suction power and supports home mapping. The Shark mobile app lets you set cleaning schedules, and the self-empty base that it comes with will hold 30 days worth of dust and debris.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-10-prime-day-tech-deals-you-should-shop-before-day-2-ends-190018499.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Maybe you’re not looking to snag an iPad, a robot vacuum or a VR headset this Amazon Prime Day because you’re set with what you already have. Instead, though, consider picking up a few discounted “essential” gadgets, or really, devices you don’t want to be left without in a pinch. Charging gear falls into this camp, and Anker makes some of our favorite power banks, cables, wireless chargers and more. A bunch of Anker’s gear is on sale for October Prime Day, making now a great time to stock up. Personally, I always end up getting an extra charging cable or surge protector for my house, or I take stock of the gifts I’ll need over the next couple of months and pick up a power brick while they’re deeply discounted. Here, we’ve collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging accessories that you can still get before Prime Day ends. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "content": "Maybe you’re not looking to snag an iPad, a robot vacuum or a VR headset this Amazon Prime Day because you’re set with what you already have. Instead, though, consider picking up a few discounted “essential” gadgets, or really, devices you don’t want to be left without in a pinch. Charging gear falls into this camp, and Anker makes some of our favorite power banks, cables, wireless chargers and more. A bunch of Anker’s gear is on sale for October Prime Day, making now a great time to stock up. Personally, I always end up getting an extra charging cable or surge protector for my house, or I take stock of the gifts I’ll need over the next couple of months and pick up a power brick while they’re deeply discounted. Here, we’ve collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging accessories that you can still get before Prime Day ends. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more.

          "standfirst": "Amazon's Prime Day sale is a great time to save money on new kitchen tools — but there are only a few hours left to do so. We've combed through the thousands of deals on cooking gadgets and appliances to find the best deals on kitchen tech we've tested and recommend in our reviews and buyer's guides. We found deals on some of our top picks for rice cookers, Instant Pots, Kitchen Aid tools, air fryers and of course, the frozen dream-maker, Ninja's Creami ice cream maker. Most of these discounts will expire tonight when the sale ends, so if one of these Prime Day kitchen deals catches your eye, you may want to get it now. The best Prime Day kitchen deals KitchenAid Artisan Series Stand Mixer for $379 ($121 off): There’s a reason this is so popular among home bakers and chefs. The Artisan KitchenAid is sort of the gold standard stand mixer, as we point out in our guide to the best kitchen tech. This isn’t an all-time low (it was $350 as recently as May), but matches the July Prime Day price. Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Cosori 9-in-1 TurboBlaze Air Fryer for $90 ($30 off with Prime): This is the runner up pick in our air fryer buying guide. We appreciate the roomy basket and easy-to-use touchscreen. It’s missing the clear front window that our top pick from Instant has but, unlike that one, the Cosori has a release button on the basket which is a welcome safety feature. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40 off with Prime): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off with Prime): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker $180 ($50 off): This is one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the Creami dipped down to $160 last Black Friday but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Meater Pro wireless thermometer for $99 ($31 off with Prime): This was previously called the Meater 2 Plus, but the company changed the name. We gave it high praise in our review, and like the extended range, strong battery life, durability and precision. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $144 ($36 off with Prime): This is one of the appliances we recommend in our guide for tea gifts. I bought one based on that suggestion and have been impressed with this little kettle’s speed and good looks ever since. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $60 ($70 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. KitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May. Breville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): This is the premium pick from our guide to sous vide machines. It has a powerful 1,100-watt heater and a Turbo mode that significantly reduces cooking times. But there are no built-in controls — you’ll have to use your phone and Breville’s free app to use it. AeroPress Original for $30 ($10 off): We’re fans of AeroPress portable coffee makers and recommend the pricer Go Plus model in our guide to coffee gifts. If you don’t want to spend quite so much, grab the original model, which is even cheaper for Prime Day. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $70 ($70 off with Prime): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($30 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off with Prime): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July. Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-our-favorite-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-save-up-to-50-percent-before-the-sale-ends-193009680.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Regardless of if you need a new laptop for work or play, October Prime Day may have just what you’re looking for at a good price. Amongst the clothing, shoes, household essentials and other tech gear are some decent laptop deals that you can snag if you’re a Prime member — and even some that you can grab without a Prime subscription. But deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best October Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them during the final hours of the sale. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $979 (18 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Acer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,050 (25 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

          "standfirst": "Check your research, MIT: 95% of AI projects aren’t failing — far from it.According to new data from G2, nearly 60% of companies already have AI agents in production, and fewer than 2% actually fail once deployed. That paints a very different picture from recent academic forecasts suggesting widespread AI project stagnation.As one of the world’s largest crowdsourced software review platforms, G2’s dataset reflects real-world adoption trends — which show that AI agents are proving far more durable and “sticky” than early generative AI pilots.“Our report’s really pointing out that agentic is a different beast when it comes to AI with respect to failure or success,” Tim Sanders, G2’s head of research, told VentureBeat. Handing off to AI in customer service, BI, software developmentSanders points out that the now oft-referenced MIT study, released in July, only considered gen AI custom projects, Sanders argues, and many media outlets generalized that to AI failing 95% of the time. He points out that university researchers analyzed public announcements, rather than closed-loop data. If companies didn’t announce a P&L impact, their projects were considered a failure — even if they really weren’t. G2’s 2025 AI Agents Insights Report, by contrast, surveyed more than 1,300 B2B decision-makers, finding that: 57% of companies have agents in production and 70% say agents are “core to operations”;83% of are satisfied with agent performance;Enterprises are now investing an average of $1 million-plus annually, with 1 in 4 spending $5 million-plus; 9 out of 10 plan to increase that investment over the next 12 months; Organizations have seen 40% cost savings, 23% faster workflows, and 1 in 3 report 50%-plus speed gains, particularly in marketing and saless;Nearly 90% of study participants reported higher employee satisfaction in departments where agents were deployed.The leading use cases for AI agents? Customer service, business intelligence (BI) and software development. Interestingly, G2 found a “surprising number” (about 1 in 3) of what Sanders calls ‘let it rip’ organizations. “They basically allowed the agent to do a task and then they would either roll it back immediately if it was a bad action, or do QA so that they could retract the bad actions very, very quickly,” he explained. At the same time, though, agent programs with a human in the loop were twice as likely to deliver cost savings — 75% or more — than fully autonomous agent strategies.This reflects what Sanders called a “dead heat” between ‘let it rip’ organizations and ‘leave some human gates’ organizations. “There&#x27;s going to be a human in the loop years from now,” he said. “Over half of our respondents told us there&#x27;s more human oversight than we expected.” However, nearly half of IT buyers are comfortable with granting agents full autonomy in low-risk workflows such as data remediation or data pipeline management. Meanwhile, think of BI and research as prep work, Sanders said; agents gather information in the background to prepare humans to make last passes and final decisions. A classic example of this is a mortgage loan, Sanders noted: Agents do everything right up until the human analyzes their findings and yay or nays the loan. If there are mistakes, they&#x27;re in the background. “It just doesn&#x27;t publish on your behalf and put your name on it,” said Sanders. “So as a result, you trust it more. You use it more.” When it comes to specific deployment methods, Salesforce&#x27;s Agentforce “is winning” over ready-made agents and in-house builds, taking up 38% of all market share, Sanders reported. However, many organizations seem to be going hybrid with a goal to eventually stand up in-house tools. Then, because they want a trusted source of data, “they&#x27;re going to crystallize around Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, companies with a real system of record,” he predicted. AI agents aren&#x27;t deadline-drivenWhy are agents (in some instances at least) so much better than humans? Sanders pointed to a concept called Parkinson&#x27;s Law, which states that ‘work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.’“Individual productivity doesn&#x27;t lead to organizational productivity because humans are only really driven by deadlines,” said Sanders. When organizations looked at gen AI projects, they didn’t move the goal posts; the deadlines didn’t change. “The only way that you fix that is to either move the goal post up or deal with non-humans, because non-humans aren&#x27;t subject to Parkinson&#x27;s Law,” he said, pointing out that they’re not afflicted with “the human procrastination syndrome.”Agents don&#x27;t take breaks. They don&#x27;t get distracted. “They just grind so you don&#x27;t have to change the deadlines,” said Sanders. “If you focus on faster and faster QA cycles that may even be automated, you fix your agents faster than you fix your humans.” Start with business problems, understand that trust is a slow buildStill, Sanders sees AI following the cloud when it comes to trust: He remembers in 2007 when everyone was quick to deploy cloud tools; then by 2009 or 2010, “there was kind of a trough of trust.” Mix this in with security concerns: 39% of all respondents to G2’s survey said they’d experienced a security incident since deploying AI; 25% of the time, it was severe. Sanders emphasized that companies must think about measuring in milliseconds how quickly an agent can be retrained to never repeat a bad action again. Always include IT operations in AI deployments, he advised. They know what went wrong with gen AI and robotic process automation (RPA) and can get to the bottom of explainability, which leads to a lot more trust. On the flip side, though: Don&#x27;t blindly trust vendors. In fact, only half of respondents said they did; Sanders noted that the No. 1 trust signal is agent explainability. “In qualitative interviews, we were told over and over again, if you [a vendor] can&#x27;t explain it, you can&#x27;t deploy it and manage it.” It’s also critical to begin with the business problem and work backwards, he advised: Don&#x27;t buy agents, then look for a proof of concept. If leaders apply agents to the biggest pain points, internal users will be more forgiving when incidents occur, and more willing to iterate, therefore building up their skillsets. “People still don&#x27;t trust the cloud, they definitely don&#x27;t trust gen AI, they might not trust agents until they experience it, and then the game changes,” said Sanders. “Trust arrives on a mule — you don’t just get forgiveness.”",
          "content": "Check your research, MIT: 95% of AI projects aren’t failing — far from it.According to new data from G2, nearly 60% of companies already have AI agents in production, and fewer than 2% actually fail once deployed. That paints a very different picture from recent academic forecasts suggesting widespread AI project stagnation.As one of the world’s largest crowdsourced software review platforms, G2’s dataset reflects real-world adoption trends — which show that AI agents are proving far more durable and “sticky” than early generative AI pilots.“Our report’s really pointing out that agentic is a different beast when it comes to AI with respect to failure or success,” Tim Sanders, G2’s head of research, told VentureBeat. Handing off to AI in customer service, BI, software developmentSanders points out that the now oft-referenced MIT study, released in July, only considered gen AI custom projects, Sanders argues, and many media outlets generalized that to AI failing 95% of the time. He points out that university researchers analyzed public announcements, rather than closed-loop data. If companies didn’t announce a P&L impact, their projects were considered a failure — even if they really weren’t.

          "standfirst": "The same connectivity that made Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) the fastest-adopted AI integration standard in 2025 has created enterprise cybersecurity&#x27;s most dangerous blind spot. Recent research from Pynt quantifies the growing threat in clear, unambiguous terms. Their analysis exposes the startling network effect of vulnerabilities that escalate the more MCP plugins are used. Deploying just ten MCP plugins creates a 92% probability of exploitation. At three interconnected servers, risk exceeds 50%. Even a single MCP plugin presents a 9% exploit probability, and the threat compounds exponentially with each addition.MCPs&#x27; security paradox is driving one of the enterprises&#x27; most significant AI risksThe design premise for MCP began with a commendable goal of solving AI&#x27;s integration chaos. Anthropic chose to standardize how large language models (LLMs) connect to external tools and data sources, delivering what every organization working with AI models and resources desperately needed: a universal interface for AI agents to access everything from APIs, cloud services, databases, and more. Anthropic&#x27;s launch was so well orchestrated that MCP immediately gained traction with many of the leading AI companies in the industry, including Google and Microsoft, who both quickly adopted the standard. Now, a short ten months after the launch, there are over 16,000 MCP servers deployed across Fortune 500 companies this year alone.At the core of MCP&#x27;s security paradox is its greatest strength, which is frictionless connectivity and pervasive integration with as little friction as possible. That aspect of the protocol is its greatest weakness. Security wasn&#x27;t built into the protocol&#x27;s core design. Authentication remains optional. Authorization frameworks arrived just six months ago in updates, months after the protocol had seen widespread deployments. Combined, these two factors are fueling a quickly sprawling attack surface where every new connection multiplies risk, creating a network effect of vulnerabilities.\"MCP is shipping with the same mistake we&#x27;ve seen in every major protocol rollout: insecure defaults,\" warns Merritt Baer, Chief Security Officer at Enkrypt AI and advisor to companies including Andesite and AppOmni told VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"If we don&#x27;t build authentication and least privilege in from day one, we&#x27;ll be cleaning up breaches for the next decade.\"Source: Pynt, Quantifying Risk Exposure Across 281 MCPs Report Defining Compositional Risk: How security breaks at scalePynt&#x27;s analysis of 281 MCP servers provides the data needed to illustrate the mathematical principles that are core to compositional risk. According to their analysis, 72% of MCPs expose sensitive capabilities that include dynamic code execution, file system access, and privileged API calls, while 13% accept untrusted inputs like web scraping, Slack messages, email, or RSS feeds. When these two risk factors intersect, as they do in 9% of real-world MCP setups, attackers gain direct pathways to prompt injections, command execution, and data exfiltration, often without a single human approval required. These aren&#x27;t hypothetical vulnerabilities; they&#x27;re live, measurable exploit paths hidden within everyday MCP configurations.\"When you plug into an MCP server, you&#x27;re not just trusting your own security, you&#x27;re inheriting the hygiene of every tool, every credential, every developer in that chain,\" Baer warns. \"That&#x27;s a supply chain risk in real time.\"Source: Pynt, Quantifying Risk Exposure Across 281 MCPs Report A growing base of real-world exploits shows that MCP&#x27;s vulnerabilities are real Security research teams from many of the industry&#x27;s leading companies continue their work to identify real-world exploits that MCP is currently seeing in the wild, in addition to those that are theoretical in nature. The MCP protocol continues to show increased vulnerabilities in different scenarios, with the main ones including the following: CVE-2025-6514 (CVSS 9.6): The MCP-remote package, downloaded over 500,000 times, carries a critical vulnerability allowing arbitrary OS command execution. \"The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger arbitrary OS command execution on the machine running MCP-remote when it initiates a connection to an untrusted MCP server, launching a full system compromise,\" warns JFrog&#x27;s security team.The Postmark MCP Backdoor: Koi Security uncovered that the postmark-mcp npm package had been trojanized to grant attackers implicit \"god-mode\" access within AI workflows. In version 1.0.16, the malicious actor inserted a single line of code that silently BCC&#x27;d every outbound email to their domain (e.g., phan@giftshop.club), effectively exfiltrating internal memos, invoices, and password resets, all without raising alerts. As Koi researchers put it: \"These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves — full email access, database connections, API permissions — yet they don&#x27;t appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways.\" Idan Dardikman, co-founder and CTO at Koi Security, writes in a recent blog post exposing just how lethal the postmark-mcp npm package is, \"Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren&#x27;t like regular npm packages. These are tools specifically designed for AI assistants to use autonomously.\"\"If you&#x27;re using postmark-mcp version 1.0.16 or later, you&#x27;re compromised. Remove it immediately and rotate any credentials that may have been exposed through email. But more importantly, audit every MCP server you&#x27;re using. Ask yourself: Do you actually know who built these tools you&#x27;re trusting with everything? \" Dardikman writes. He ends the post with solid advice: \"Stay paranoid. With MCPs, paranoia is just good sense.\"CVE-2025-49596: Oligo Security exposed a critical RCE vulnerability in Anthropic&#x27;s MCP Inspector, enabling browser-based attacks. \"With code execution on a developer&#x27;s machine, attackers can steal data, install backdoors, and move laterally across networks,\" explains Avi Lumelsky, security researcher Trail of Bits&#x27; \"Line Jumping\" Attack: Researchers demonstrated how malicious MCP servers inject prompts through tool descriptions to manipulate AI behavior without ever being explicitly invoked. \"This vulnerability exploits the faulty assumption that humans provide a reliable defense layer,\" the team notes.Additional vulnerabilities include prompt injection attacks hijacking AI behavior, tool poisoning, manipulating server metadata, authentication weaknesses where tokens pass through untrusted proxies, and supply chain attacks through compromised npm packages.The authentication gap needs to be designed out first Authentication and authorization were initially optional in MCP. The protocol prioritized interoperability over security, assuming enterprises would add their own controls. They haven&#x27;t. OAuth 2.0 authorization finally arrived in March 2025, refined to OAuth 2.1 by June. But thousands of MCP servers deployed without authentication remain in production. Academic research from Queen&#x27;s University analyzed 1,899 open-source MCP servers and found 7.2% contain general vulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning. Gartner&#x27;s survey (via IBM&#x27;s Human–Machine Identity Blur paper) reveals organizations deploy 45 cybersecurity tools but effectively manage only 44% of machine identities, meaning half the identities in enterprise ecosystems could be invisible and unmanaged.Defining a comprehensive MCP defense strategy is table stakesDefining a multilayer MCP defense strategy helps to close the gaps left in the original protocol&#x27;s structure. The layers defined here look to bring together architectural safeguards and immediate operational measures to reduce an organization&#x27;s threat surface.Layer 1: Start with the weakest area of MCP which is authentication and access controls Improving authentication and access controls needs to start with enforcing OAuth 2.1 for each MCP gateway across an organization. Gartner notes that enterprises enforcing these measures report 48% fewer vulnerabilities, 30% better user adoption, and centralized MCP server monitoring. \"MCP gateways serve as essential security intermediaries,\" writes the research firm, by providing unified server catalogs and real-time monitoring. Layer 2: Why semantic layers matter in contextual securitySemantic layers are essential for bringing greater context to each access decision, ensuring AI agents work only with standardized, trusted, and verifiable data. Deploying semantic layers helps reduce operational overhead, improves natural language query accuracy, and delivers the real-time traceability security leaders need. VentureBeat is seeing the practice of embedding security policies directly into data access contribute to reduced breach risks and more secure agentic analytics workflows.Layer 3: Knowledge graphs are essential for visibilityBy definition, knowledge graphs connect entities, analytics assets, and business processes, enabling AI agents to operate transparently and securely within an organizational context. Gartner highlights this capability as critical for regulatory compliance, auditability, and trust, especially in complex queries and workflows. Merritt Baer underscores the urgency: \"If you&#x27;re using MCP today, you already need security. Guardrails, monitoring, and audit logs aren&#x27;t optional — they&#x27;re the difference between innovation with and without risk mitigation,\" advises Baer. Recommended action plan for security leadersVentureBeat recommends security leaders who have MCP-based integrations active in their organizations take the following five precautionary actions to secure their infrastructure: Make it a practice of implementing MCP Gateways by first enforcing OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect while centralizing MCP server registration. Define how your infrastructure can support a layered security architecture with semantic layers and knowledge graphs alongside gateways.Turn the activity of conducting regular MCP audits through threat modeling, continuous monitoring, and red-teaming into the muscle memory of your security teams, so it&#x27;s done by reflex.Limit MCP plugin usage to essential plugins only—remember: 3 plugins = 52% risk, 10 plugins = 92% risk.Invest in AI-specific security as a distinct risk category within your cybersecurity strategy.",

          "standfirst": "Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Google Cloud AI Research have developed a framework that enables large language model (LLM) agents to organize their experiences into a memory bank, helping them get better at complex tasks over time.The framework, called ReasoningBank, distills “generalizable reasoning strategies” from an agent’s successful and failed attempts to solve problems. The agent then uses this memory during inference to avoid repeating past mistakes and make better decisions as it faces new problems. The researchers show that when combined with test-time scaling techniques, where an agent makes multiple attempts at a problem, ReasoningBank significantly improves the performance and efficiency of LLM agents.Their findings show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms classic memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, offering a practical path toward building more adaptive and reliable AI agents for enterprise applications.The challenge of LLM agent memoryAs LLM agents are deployed in applications that run for long periods, they encounter a continuous stream of tasks. One of the key limitations of current LLM agents is their failure to learn from this accumulated experience. By approaching each task in isolation, they inevitably repeat past mistakes, discard valuable insights from related problems, and fail to develop skills that would make them more capable over time.The solution to this limitation is to give agents some kind of memory. Previous efforts to give agents memory have focused on storing past interactions for reuse by organizing information in various forms from plain text to structured graphs. However, these approaches often fall short. Many use raw interaction logs or only store successful task examples. This means they can&#x27;t distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns and, crucially, they don’t extract and use the valuable information from the agent’s failures. As the researchers note in their paper, “existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.”How ReasoningBank worksReasoningBank is a memory framework designed to overcome these limitations. Its central idea is to distill useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items that can be stored and reused.According to Jun Yan, a Research Scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this marks a fundamental shift in how agents operate. \"Traditional agents operate statically—each task is processed in isolation,\" Yan explained. \"ReasoningBank changes this by turning every task experience (successful or failed) into structured, reusable reasoning memory. As a result, the agent doesn’t start from scratch with each customer; it recalls and adapts proven strategies from similar past cases.\"The framework processes both successful and failed experiences and turns them into a collection of useful strategies and preventive lessons. The agent judges success and failure through LLM-as-a-judge schemes to obviate the need for human labeling.Yan provides a practical example of this process in action. An agent tasked with finding Sony headphones might fail because its broad search query returns over 4,000 irrelevant products. \"ReasoningBank will first try to figure out why this approach failed,\" Yan said. \"It will then distill strategies such as ‘optimize search query’ and ‘confine products with category filtering.’ Those strategies will be extremely useful to get future similar tasks successfully done.\"The process operates in a closed loop. When an agent faces a new task, it uses an embedding-based search to retrieve relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. These memories are inserted into the agent’s system prompt, providing context for its decision-making. Once the task is completed, the framework creates new memory items to extract insights from successes and failures. This new knowledge is then analyzed, distilled, and merged into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its capabilities.Supercharging memory with scalingThe researchers found a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Classic test-time scaling involves generating multiple independent answers to the same question, but the researchers argue that this “vanilla form is suboptimal because it does not leverage inherent contrastive signal that arises from redundant exploration on the same problem.”To address this, they propose Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which integrates scaling with ReasoningBank. MaTTS comes in two forms. In “parallel scaling,” the system generates multiple trajectories for the same query, then compares and contrasts them to identify consistent reasoning patterns. In sequential scaling, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning within a single attempt, with the intermediate notes and corrections also serving as valuable memory signals.This creates a virtuous cycle: the existing memory in ReasoningBank steers the agent toward more promising solutions, while the diverse experiences generated through scaling enable the agent to create higher-quality memories to store in ReasoningBank. “This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents,” the researchers write.ReasoningBank in actionThe researchers tested their framework on WebArena (web browsing) and SWE-Bench-Verified (software engineering) benchmarks, using models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. They compared ReasoningBank against baselines including memory-free agents and agents using trajectory-based or workflow-based memory frameworks.The results show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms these baselines across all datasets and LLM backbones. On WebArena, it improved the overall success rate by up to 8.3 percentage points compared to a memory-free agent. It also generalized better on more difficult, cross-domain tasks, while reducing the number of interaction steps needed to complete tasks. When combined with MaTTS, both parallel and sequential scaling further boosted performance, consistently outperforming standard test-time scaling.This efficiency gain has a direct impact on operational costs. Yan points to a case where a memory-free agent took eight trial-and-error steps just to find the right product filter on a website. \"Those trial and error costs could be avoided by leveraging relevant insights from ReasoningBank,\" he noted. \"In this case, we save almost twice the operational costs,\" which also improves the user experience by resolving issues faster.For enterprises, ReasoningBank can help develop cost-effective agents that can learn from experience and adapt over time in complex workflows and areas like software development, customer support, and data analysis. As the paper concludes, “Our findings suggest a practical pathway toward building adaptive and lifelong-learning agents.”Yan confirmed that their findings point toward a future of truly compositional intelligence. For example, a coding agent could learn discrete skills like API integration and database management from separate tasks. \"Over time, these modular skills... become building blocks the agent can flexibly recombine to solve more complex tasks,\" he said, suggesting a future where agents can autonomously assemble their knowledge to manage entire workflows with minimal human oversight.",

          "title": "To scale agentic AI, Notion tore down its tech stack and started fresh",
          "standfirst": "Many organizations would be hesitant to overhaul their tech stack and start from scratch. Not Notion. For the 3.0 version of its productivity software (released in September), the company didn’t hesitate to rebuild from the ground up; they recognized that it was necessary, in fact, to support agentic AI at enterprise scale. Whereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. “Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We&#x27;ve rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomouslyNotion has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel. In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the company identified the need to move beyond simpler, task-based workflows to goal-oriented reasoning systems that allow agents to autonomously select, orchestrate, and execute tools across connected environments. Very quickly, reasoning models have become “far better” at learning to use tools and follow chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions, Sachs noted. This allows them to be “far more independent” and make multiple decisions within one agentic workflow. “We rebuilt our AI system to play to that,\" she said. From an engineering perspective, this meant replacing rigid prompt-based flows with a unified orchestration model, Sachs explained. This core model is supported by modular sub-agents that search Notion and the web, query and add to databases and edit content. Each agent uses tools contextually; for instance, they can decide whether to search Notion itself, or another platform like Slack. The model will perform successive searches until the relevant information is found. It can then, for instance, convert notes into proposals, create follow-up messages, track tasks, and spot and make updates in knowledge bases. In Notion 2.0, the team focused on having AI perform specific tasks, which required them to “think exhaustively” about how to prompt the model, Sachs noted. However, with version 3.0, users can assign tasks to agents, and agents can actually take action and perform multiple tasks concurrently. “We reorchestrated it to be self-selecting on the tools, rather than few-shotting, which is explicitly prompting how to go through all these different scenarios,” Sachs explained. The aim is to ensure everything interfaces with AI and that “anything you can do, your Notion agent can do.”Bifurcating to isolate hallucinationsNotion’s philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper,” drives a continuous iteration cycle that balances latency and accuracy through fine-tuned vector embeddings and elastic search optimization. Sachs’ team employs a rigorous evaluation framework that combines deterministic tests, vernacular optimization, human-annotated data and LLMs-as-a-judge, with model-based scoring identifying discrepancies and inaccuracies. “By bifurcating the evaluation, we&#x27;re able to identify where the problems come from, and that helps us isolate unnecessary hallucinations,” Sachs explained. Further, making the architecture itself simpler means it’s easier to make changes as models and techniques evolve. “We optimize latency and parallel thinking as much as possible,” which leads to “way better accuracy,” Sachs noted. Models are grounded in data from the web and the Notion connected workspace. Ultimately, Sachs reported, the investment in rebuilding its architecture has already provided Notion returns in terms of capability and faster rate of change. She added, “We are fully open to rebuilding it again, when the next breakthrough happens, if we have to.”Understanding contextual latencyWhen building and fine-tuning models, it’s important to understand that latency is subjective: AI must provide the most relevant information, not necessarily the most, at the cost of speed. “You&#x27;d be surprised at the different ways customers are willing to wait for things and not wait for things,” Sachs said. It makes for an interesting experiment: How slow can you go before people abandon the model? With pure navigational search, for instance, users may not be as patient; they want answers near-immediately. “If you ask, ‘What&#x27;s two plus two,’ you don&#x27;t want to wait for your agent to be searching everywhere in Slack and JIRA,” Sachs pointed out. But the longer the time it&#x27;s given, the more exhaustive a reasoning agent can be. For instance, Notion can perform 20 minutes of autonomous work across hundreds of websites, files and other materials. In these instances, users are more willing to wait, Sachs explained; they allow the model to execute in the background while they attend to other tasks. “It&#x27;s a product question,” said Sachs. “How do we set user expectations from the UI? How do we ascertain user expectations on latency?”Notion is its biggest userNotion understands the importance of using its own product — in fact, its employees are among its biggest power users. Sachs explained that teams have active sandboxes that generate training and evaluation data, as well as a “really active” thumbs-up-thumbs-down user feedback loop. Users aren’t shy about saying what they think should be improved or features they’d like to see. Sachs emphasized that when a user thumbs down an interaction, they are explicitly giving permission to a human annotator to analyze that interaction in a way that de-anonymizes them as much as possible. “We are using our own tool as a company all day, every day, and so we get really fast feedback loops,” said Sachs. “We’re really dogfooding our own product.” That said, it’s their own product they’re building, Sachs noted, so they understand that they may have goggles on when it comes to quality and functionality. To balance this out, Notion has trusted \"very AI-savvy\" design partners who are granted early access to new capabilities and provide important feedback. Sachs emphasized that this is just as important as internal prototyping. “We&#x27;re all about experimenting in the open, I think you get much richer feedback,” said Sachs. “Because at the end of the day, if we just look at how Notion uses Notion, we&#x27;re not really giving the best experience to our customers.” Just as importantly, continuous internal testing allows teams to evaluate progressions and make sure models aren&#x27;t regressing (when accuracy and performance degrades over time). \"Everything you&#x27;re doing stays faithful,\" Sachs explained. \"You know that your latency is within bounds.\" Many companies make the mistake of focusing too intensely on retroactively-focused evans; this makes it difficult for them to understand how or where they&#x27;re improving, Sachs pointed out. Notion considers evals as a \"litmus test\" of development and forward-looking progression and evals of observability and regression proofing. “I think a big mistake a lot of companies make is conflating the two,” said Sachs. “We use them for both purposes; we think about them really differently.”Takeaways from Notion&#x27;s journeyFor enterprises, Notion can serve as a blueprint for how to responsibly and dynamically operationalize agentic AI in a connected, permissioned enterprise workspace. Sach’s takeaways for other tech leaders: Don’t be afraid to rebuild when foundational capabilities change; Notion fully re-engineered its architecture to align with reasoning-based models.Treat latency as contextual: Optimize per use case, rather than universally. Ground all outputs in trustworthy, curated enterprise data to ensure accuracy and trust. She advised: “Be willing to make the hard decisions. Be willing to sit at the top of the frontier, so to speak, on what you&#x27;re developing to build the best product you can for your customers.”",

          "title": "Here’s what Jony Ive and Sam Altman revealed about their secretive AI hardware project at OpenAI’s Dev Day",
          "standfirst": "In a packed theater at Fort Mason, after a whirlwind keynote of product announcements, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat down with Sir Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple&#x27;s most iconic products. The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new \"family\" of AI-powered devices.The partnership, solidified by OpenAI&#x27;s staggering $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive&#x27;s hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.For nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life&#x27;s work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.Jony Ive&#x27;s post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPTThe collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective, LoveFrom.\"With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,\" Ive said. \"We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing... I&#x27;ve never in my career come across anything vaguely like the affordance, like the capability that we&#x27;re now starting to sense.\"This capability, he argued, demands a fundamental rethinking of the devices we use, which he described as \"legacy products\" from a bygone era. The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.\"The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,\" Ive said. \"We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.\"An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxietyThe most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.\"I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,\" Ive began, before adding, \"When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.\"Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. \"I know I should care about productivity, and I do,\" he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools \"make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.\"He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. \"We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,\" he stated. \"We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.\"Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challengeWhile the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about technical hurdles and philosophical debates delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.\"The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas.

          "content": "In a packed theater at Fort Mason, after a whirlwind keynote of product announcements, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat down with Sir Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple&#x27;s most iconic products. The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new \"family\" of AI-powered devices.The partnership, solidified by OpenAI&#x27;s staggering $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive&#x27;s hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.For nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life&#x27;s work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.Jony Ive&#x27;s post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPTThe collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective, LoveFrom.\"With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,\" Ive said. \"We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing... I&#x27;ve never in my career come across anything vaguely like the affordance, like the capability that we&#x27;re now starting to sense.\"This capability, he argued, demands a fundamental rethinking of the devices we use, which he described as \"legacy products\" from a bygone era. The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.\"The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,\" Ive said. \"We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.\"An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxietyThe most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.\"I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,\" Ive began, before adding, \"When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.\"Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. \"I know I should care about productivity, and I do,\" he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools \"make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.\"He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. \"We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,\" he stated. \"We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.\"Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challengeWhile the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about technical hurdles and philosophical debates delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.\"The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas. And the challenge is trying to focus,\" Ive confessed.\"I used to be good at that, and I&#x27;ve lost some confidence, because the choices are, it&#x27;ll be easy if you really knew there were three good ones... it&#x27;s just not like that.\"This admission provides context to reports that the team is grappling with unresolved issues around the device&#x27;s \"personality\" and computing infrastructure.

          "standfirst": "The trend of AI researchers developing new, small open source generative models that outperform far larger, proprietary peers continued this week with yet another staggering advancement.Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Senior AI Researcher at Samsung&#x27;s Advanced​ Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Montreal, Canada,​ has introduced the Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) — a neural network so small it contains just 7 million parameters (internal model settings), yet it competes with or surpasses cutting-edge language models 10,000 times larger in terms of their parameter count, including OpenAI&#x27;s o3-mini and Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro, on some of the toughest reasoning benchmarks in AI research. The goal is to show that very highly performant new AI models can be created affordably without massive investments in the graphics processing units (GPUs) and power needed to train the larger, multi-trillion parameter flagship models powering many LLM chatbots today. The results were described in a research paper published on open access website arxiv.org, entitled \"Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks.\"\"The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to solve hard tasks is a trap,\" wrote Jolicoeur-Martineau on the social network X. \"Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction.\"Jolicoeur-Martineau also added: \"With recursive reasoning, it turns out that &#x27;less is more&#x27;. A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.\"TRM&#x27;s code is available now on Github under an enterprise-friendly, commercially viable MIT License — meaning anyone from researchers to companies can take, modify it, and deploy it for their own purposes, even commercial applications.One Big CaveatHowever, readers should be aware that TRM was designed specifically to perform well on structured, visual, grid-based problems like Sudoku, mazes, and puzzles on the ARC (Abstract and Reasoning Corpus)-AGI benchmark, the latter which offers tasks that should be easy for humans but difficult for AI models, such sorting colors on a grid based on a prior, but not identical, solution. From Hierarchy to SimplicityThe TRM architecture represents a radical simplification. It builds upon a technique called Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) introduced earlier this year, which showed that small networks could tackle logical puzzles like Sudoku and mazes. HRM relied on two cooperating networks—one operating at high frequency, the other at low—supported by biologically inspired arguments and mathematical justifications involving fixed-point theorems. Jolicoeur-Martineau found this unnecessarily complicated.TRM strips these elements away. Instead of two networks, it uses a single two-layer model that recursively refines its own predictions. The model begins with an embedded question and an initial answer, represented by variables x, y, and z. Through a series of reasoning steps, it updates its internal latent representation z and refines the answer y until it converges on a stable output. Each iteration corrects potential errors from the previous step, yielding a self-improving reasoning process without extra hierarchy or mathematical overhead.How Recursion Replaces ScaleThe core idea behind TRM is that recursion can substitute for depth and size.By iteratively reasoning over its own output, the network effectively simulates a much deeper architecture without the associated memory or computational cost. This recursive cycle, run over as many as sixteen supervision steps, allows the model to make progressively better predictions — similar in spirit to how large language models use multi-step “chain-of-thought” reasoning, but achieved here with a compact, feed-forward design.The simplicity pays off in both efficiency and generalization. The model uses fewer layers, no fixed-point approximations, and no dual-network hierarchy. A lightweight halting mechanism decides when to stop refining, preventing wasted computation while maintaining accuracy.Performance That Punches Above Its WeightDespite its small footprint, TRM delivers benchmark results that rival or exceed models millions of times larger. In testing, the model achieved:87.4% accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme (up from 55% for HRM)85% accuracy on Maze-Hard puzzles45% accuracy on ARC-AGI-18% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2These results surpass or closely match performance from several high-end large language models, including DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3-mini, despite TRM using less than 0.01% of their parameters.Such results suggest that recursive reasoning, not scale, may be the key to handling abstract and combinatorial reasoning problems — domains where even top-tier generative models often stumble.Design Philosophy: Less Is MoreTRM’s success stems from deliberate minimalism. Jolicoeur-Martineau found that reducing complexity led to better generalization. When the researcher increased layer count or model size, performance declined due to overfitting on small datasets. By contrast, the two-layer structure, combined with recursive depth and deep supervision, achieved optimal results.The model also performed better when self-attention was replaced with a simpler multilayer perceptron on tasks with small, fixed contexts like Sudoku. For larger grids, such as ARC puzzles, self-attention remained valuable. These findings underline that model architecture should match data structure and scale rather than default to maximal capacity.Training Small, Thinking BigTRM is now officially available as open source under an MIT license on GitHub.The repository includes full training and evaluation scripts, dataset builders for Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI, and reference configurations for reproducing the published results. It also documents compute requirements ranging from a single NVIDIA L40S GPU for Sudoku training to multi-GPU H100 setups for ARC-AGI experiments.The open release confirms that TRM is designed specifically for structured, grid-based reasoning tasks rather than general-purpose language modeling. Each benchmark — Sudoku-Extreme, Maze-Hard, and ARC-AGI — uses small, well-defined input–output grids, aligning with the model’s recursive supervision process. Training involves substantial data augmentation (such as color permutations and geometric transformations), underscoring that TRM’s efficiency lies in its parameter size rather than total compute demand.The model’s simplicity and transparency make it more accessible to researchers outside of large corporate labs. Its codebase builds directly on the earlier Hierarchical Reasoning Model framework but removes HRM’s biological analogies, multiple network hierarchies, and fixed-point dependencies. In doing so, TRM offers a reproducible baseline for exploring recursive reasoning in small models — a counterpoint to the dominant “scale is all you need” philosophy.Community ReactionThe release of TRM and its open-source codebase prompted an immediate debate among AI researchers and practitioners on X. While many praised the achievement, others questioned how broadly its methods could generalize.Supporters hailed TRM as proof that small models can outperform giants, calling it “10,000× smaller yet smarter” and a potential step toward architectures that think rather than merely scale. Critics countered that TRM’s domain is narrow — focused on bounded, grid-based puzzles — and that its compute savings come mainly from size, not total runtime. Researcher Yunmin Cha noted that TRM’s training depends on heavy augmentation and recursive passes, “more compute, same model.” Cancer geneticist and data scientist Chey Loveday stressed that TRM is a solver, not a chat model or text generator: it excels at structured reasoning but not open-ended language.Machine learning researcher Sebastian Raschka positioned TRM as an important simplification of HRM rather than a new form of general intelligence. He described its process as “a two-step loop that updates an internal reasoning state, then refines the answer.”Several researchers, including Augustin Nabele, agreed that the model’s strength lies in its clear reasoning structure but noted that future work would need to show transfer to less-constrained problem types.The consensus emerging online is that TRM may be narrow, but its message is broad: careful recursion, not constant expansion, could drive the next wave of reasoning research.Looking AheadWhile TRM currently applies to supervised reasoning tasks, its recursive framework opens several future directions. Jolicoeur-Martineau has suggested exploring generative or multi-answer variants, where the model could produce multiple possible solutions rather than a single deterministic one. Another open question involves scaling laws for recursion — determining how far the “less is more” principle can extend as model complexity or data size grows.Ultimately, the study offers both a practical tool and a conceptual reminder: progress in AI need not depend on ever-larger models. Sometimes, teaching a small network to think carefully — and recursively — can be more powerful than making a large one think once.",

AI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B, a “tiny” open-source model that can run extended reasoning, code generation and respond based on ground truth. Jamba Reasoning 3B handles more than 250,000 tokens and can run inference on edge devices. The company said Jamba Reasoning 3B works on devices such as laptops and mobile phones. Ori Goshen, co-CEO of AI21, told VentureBeat that the company sees more enterprise use cases for small models, mainly because moving most inference to devices frees up data centers. “What we&#x27;re seeing right now in the industry is an economics issue where there are very expensive data center build-outs, and the revenue that is generated from the data centers versus the depreciation rate of all their chips shows the math doesn&#x27;t add up,” Goshen said. He added that in the future “the industry by and large would be hybrid in the sense that some of the computation will be on devices locally and other inference will move to GPUs.”Tested on a MacBook Jamba Reasoning 3B combines the Mamba architecture and Transformers to allow it to run a 250K token window on devices. AI21 said it can do 2-4x faster inference speeds. Goshen said the Mamba architecture significantly contributed to the model’s speed. Jamba Reasoning 3B’s hybrid architecture also allows it to reduce memory requirements, thereby reducing its computing needs. AI21 tested the model on a standard MacBook Pro and found that it can process 35 tokens per second. Goshen said the model works best for tasks involving function calling, policy-grounded generation and tool routing. He said that simple requests, such as asking for information about a forthcoming meeting and asking the model to create an agenda for it, could be done on devices. The more complex reasoning tasks can be saved for GPU clusters. Small models in enterpriseEnterprises have been interested in using a mix of small models, some of which are specifically designed for their industry and some that are condensed versions of LLMs. In September, Meta released MobileLLM-R1, a family of reasoning models ranging from 140M to 950M parameters. These models are designed for math, coding and scientific reasoning rather than chat applications. MobileLLM-R1 can run on compute-constrained devices. Google’s Gemma was one of the first small models to come to the market, designed to run on portable devices like laptops and mobile phones. Gemma has since been expanded. Companies like FICO have also begun building their own models. FICO launched its FICO Focused Language and FICO Focused Sequence small models that will only answer finance-specific questions. Goshen said the big difference their model offers is that it’s even smaller than most models and yet it can run reasoning tasks without sacrificing speed. Benchmark testing In benchmark testing, Jamba Reasoning 3B demonstrated strong performance compared to other small models, including Qwen 4B, Meta’s Llama 3.2B-3B, and Phi-4-Mini from Microsoft. It outperformed all models on the IFBench test and Humanity’s Last Exam, although it came in second to Qwen 4 on MMLU-Pro. Goshen said another advantage of small models like Jamba Reasoning 3B is that they are highly steerable and provide better privacy options to enterprises because the inference is not sent to a server elsewhere. “I do believe there’s a world where you can optimize for the needs and the experience of the customer, and the models that will be kept on devices are a large part of it,” he said.",

You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it. Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine learning tools. These machine learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.Read full article Comments",

That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats. The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.Read full article Comments",

Martin's novella series, Tales of Dunk and Egg. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms adapts the first novella in the series, The Hedge Knight, and is set 50 years after the events of House of the Dragon. Per the official premise: A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named \"Dunk,\" along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka \"Egg,\" a child prince and Dunk's squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg's older brother, Prince Aerion \"Brightflame\" Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg's uncle, Prince Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dornish puppeteer named Tanselle; Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel \"Laughing Storm\" Baratheon, heir to House Baratheon; and Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Egg's father.Read full article Comments",

There were even external cheat devices that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended. While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix announced that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade would include new \"streamlined progression\" features. As the name implies, the new options menu will give players the opportunity to blaze through the game with infinite health, magic, and money, quicker leveling, maximum damage attacks, and more. \"Constant Max HP\" is a funny way to spell and pronounce \"god mode.\" Credit: Reddit / Square Enix While some responded negatively to what they derisively called a \"cheat mode,\" director Naoki Hamaguchi defended the new options in a recent interview with Automaton. \"Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far,\" he said. \"I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content.

          "content": "Discord says that hackers made off with images of 70,000 users’ government IDs that they were required to provide in order to use the site. Like an increasing number of sites, Discord requires certain users to provide a photo or scan of their driver's license or other government ID that shows they meet the minimum age requirements in their country. In some cases, Discord allows users to prove their age by providing a selfie that shows their faces (it’s not clear how a face proves someone’s age, but there you go). The social media site imposes these requirements on users who are reported by other users to be under the minimum age for the country they’re connecting from. “A substantial risk for identity theft” On Wednesday, Discord said that ID images of roughly 70,000 users “may have had government-ID photos exposed” in a recent breach of a third-party service Discord entrusted to manage the data. The affected users had communicated with Discord’s Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams and subsequently submitted the IDs in reviews of age-related appeals.Read full article Comments",

MARANELLO, ITALY—The E-Building is one of the newest on Ferrari's sprawling factory complex. One of the first LEED-certified buildings in Italy, the gleaming white interior is the latest in flexible factory design, capable of assembling any model in the automaker's range. And from next year, that will include Ferrari's first electric vehicle. It's a momentous occasion for Ferrari, and one it's taking its time over—although it has now briefed us on some powertrain and chassis details, we'll have to wait until next year before seeing the interior or exterior of a car that it's calling the Ferrari Elettrica—for now at least. Ferrari says it considered an all-electric two-seater or even something with occasional rear seats, but the performance benefit of an electric powertrain wasn't enough to offset the added mass for either of those applications. Those calculations did work out in favor of a four-seater, though; the battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 3.1 inches (80 mm) compared to an internal combustion engine powertrain and reduces the polar moment of inertia by 20 percent.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called moai, built some 800 years ago and typically mounted on platforms called ahu. Scholars have puzzled over the moai on Easter Island for decades, pondering their cultural significance, as well as how a Stone Age culture managed to carve and transport statues weighing as much as 92 tons. One hypothesis, championed by archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University, among others, is that the statues were transported in a vertical position, with workers using ropes to essentially \"walk\" the moai onto their platforms. The oral traditions of the people of Rapa Nui certainly include references to the moai \"walking\" from the quarry to their platforms, such as a song that tells of an early ancestor who made the statues walk. While there have been rudimentary field tests showing it might have been possible, the hypothesis has also generated a fair amount of criticism. So Lipo has co-authored a new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science offering fresh experimental evidence of \"walking\" moai, based on 3D modeling of the physics and new field tests to recreate that motion. The first Europeans arrived in the 17th century and found only a few thousand inhabitants on the tiny island (just 14 by 7 miles across) thousands of miles away from any other land. In order to explain the presence of so many moai, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people. But Lipo thought perhaps the feat could be accomplished with fewer workers. In 2012, Lipo and his colleague, Terry Hunt of the University of Arizona, showed that you could transport a 10-foot, 5-ton moai a few hundred yards with just 18 people and three strong ropes by employing a rocking motion.Read full article Comments",

When your board pushes your CEO into leaving, and starts arguing with the new CEO about major strategy decisions almost immediately?

When you need to explain to the president why your CEO should keep his job, and then explain to investors the many possible downsides of a mercurial president deciding he wants a stake in your company? I feel like the answer to these questions is \"mostly no.\" Even Intel's recent investment from and partnership with Nvidia came with a tacit admission that Intel was mostly failing to make a dent in AI hardware and software and the gaming and workstation GPU markets.

This mission, named OSIRIS-APEX, was one of 19 operating NASA science missions the White House proposed canceling in a budget blueprint released earlier this year. \"We were called for cancellation as part to the president's budget request, and we were reinstated and given a plan to move ahead in FY26 (Fiscal Year 2026) just two weeks ago,\" said Dani DellaGiustina, principal investigator for OSIRIS-APEX at the University of Arizona. \"Our spacecraft appears happy and healthy.\"Read full article Comments",

He had abnormalities in his lungs, intestines, blood, liver, and lymphatic system—and, of course, no single clear explanation. His case was such a riddle that a master clinician with an expertise in clinical reasoning was called in to help unravel it. In a case report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the expert and the man's other doctors lay out the masterful medical deduction that explained his remarkable case—which had an entirely unremarkable cause. It all started about two weeks before his hospital visit. A mild, dull pain had developed in the patient's right lower abdomen and back. Nine days later, a fever and body aches also developed. The next day, he went to urgent care, where clinicians gave him intravenous fluids and an intravenous pain reliever. His abdominal pain went away, and he was discharged. But the pain returned over the next few days, and with it came nausea and vomiting. He then started coughing and having trouble breathing.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr says Internet service providers shouldn't have to list every fee they charge. Responding to a request from cable and telecom lobby groups, he is proposing to eliminate a rule that requires ISPs to itemize various fees in broadband price labels that must be made available to consumers. The rule took effect in April 2024 after the FCC rejected ISPs' complaints that listing every fee they created would be too difficult. The rule applies specifically to recurring monthly fees \"that providers impose at their discretion, i.e., charges not mandated by a government.\" ISPs could comply with the rule either by listing the fees or by dropping the fees altogether and, if they choose, raising their overall prices by a corresponding amount. But the latter option wouldn't fit with the strategy of enticing customers with a low advertised price and hitting them with the real price on their monthly bills. The broadband price label rules were created to stop ISPs from advertising misleadingly low prices.Read full article Comments",
