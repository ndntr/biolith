          "standfirst": "Making a good digital picture frame should be easy. All you need is a good screen and an uncomplicated way to get your favorite photos onto the device. Combine that with an inoffensive, frame-like design and you're good to go.Despite that, I can tell you that many digital photo frames are awful. Amazon is positively littered with scads of digital frames and it's basically the 2020s version of what we saw with knock-off iPods back in the 2000s. There are loads of options that draw you in with a low price but deliver a totally subpar experience that will prompt you to shove the thing in a drawer and forget about it.The good news is that you only need to find one smart photo frame that works. From there, you can have a pretty delightful experience. If you're anything like me, you have thousands of photos on your phone of friends, family photos, pets, vacation spots, perhaps some lattes or plates of pasta and much more. Too often, those photos stay siloed on our phones, not shared with others or enjoyed on a larger scale. And sure, I can look at my photos on my laptop or an iPad, but there's something enjoyable about having a dedicated place for these things. After all, there's a reason photo frames exist in the first place, right? A great frame can help you send photos to loved ones and share cherished memories with friends and family effortlessly. I tested out seven smart photo frames to weed through the junk and find the top picks for the best digital frames worth buying. Best digital picture frames for 2025 What to look for in digital picture frames While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.) But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles. A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one. Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot. Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method. Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order. While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones. How much should you spend on a digital picture frame For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality. Digital frames FAQs Are digital photo frames a good idea? Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice. Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere? Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.

          "standfirst": "Sound is a complicated topic in cars. Some cars are good because they're very loud. Some cars are good because they're very quiet. A select few cars can be counted in both categories. Really, only Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N has managed to check both boxes, but if Ferrari's promises about its first EV are to be believed, we may soon have another entrant. At an event at the company's headquarters in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari unveiled the first proper details about its first EV, the Elettrica, which is set to fully debut next year. We're missing a few key details (such as what it looks like), but after spending a day talking to the various engineers behind this machine, I can finally reveal what makes this car move and how it might sound, too. Power is a key metric for any Ferrari, and the Elettrica has plenty of that. Four electric motors, one per wheel, combine to generate a figure somewhere over 1,000 horsepower. That would put it close to the power of the company's new F80 supercar, but in an era of 2,000-hp EVs, the Elettrica's output isn't exactly stunning. This is something even Ferrari's chief product development officer, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, admitted: \"It's very easy and simple to create power in an electric engine. It's not difficult.\" Cornering, he said, is what it's really all about. He called current performance EVs \"elephants,\" capable of going quickly in a straight line but failing miserably at being compelling machines to drive. That's partly why the Elettrica has four motors. That way, the car's traction and stability management systems can modulate power to maximize grip at each tire individually, rather than relying on one or two motors with differentials to try to manage wheelspin.But it goes deeper than that. The Elettrica can also steer each rear wheel independently, more or less on the inside or outside of the turn to help manage (or perhaps even induce) oversteer. The front motors and inverter on the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari Finally, the Elettrica will have active suspension, a novel type that debuted on the Purosangue SUV and is also used on the F80 supercar. Ferrari's dampers replace traditional valves and oil with an electric motor that provides the resistance. This means, again, the damping and ride height of the car can be adjusted independently at each corner, nearly instantly. All that, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said, will result in an EV that drives like none other on the road: \"We want to show that we are able to harness any technology in a unique way.\" Making a compelling EV, a type of car that many decry as too samey, would be a bold way to do it. One key factor to this is a unique sound. Ferrari engineers knew that they needed to come up with some sort of acoustic accompaniment for the Elettrica, but they also knew it had to be authentic. \"We didn't create a fake sound, like a starship or something like that,\" Fulgenzi said. \"We wanted to have exactly the sound of the electric engine.\" Ferrari came up with a solution similar to the one Porsche used for the Taycan, but it executed it in a novel way. In the Taycan, Porsche sampled and remixed the sounds of the car's electrical components. For the Elettrica, Ferrari actually installs an accelerometer inside the casing of the rear electric motors. That sensor picks up the harmonic resonance and runs it through a digital amplifier to create a sound that isn't a sample — it’s actually coming directly from those motors. Fulgenzi likens it to an amp on an electric guitar, picking up the near-inaudible vibration of the strings and turning it into (potentially ear-splitting) sound. That's perhaps a bit aspirational, but the proof of course will be in the listening, something that Ferrari sadly hasn't let me (or anyone else) do just yet. The rear motor and inverter for the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari They're also not showing anyone what the thing looks like, but it seems safe to expect that this machine will bear a shape and design unlike any Ferrari that's come before. That’s because Ferrari is, for the first time, working with design house LoveFrom, better known as the house that Jony Ive built after leaving Apple in 2019 and then sold to OpenAI for $6.5 billion. LoveFrom has worked on a fair few projects since its inception, but this will be the company's first car. Given that, we have absolutely nothing to go on when it comes to visual style. But if I had to guess, I'd say something with a minimalist vibe is on the menu based on Ive's previous work. (And also his own car collection, which features a lot of classic bits of iconic British motoring.) What we do know is that the Elettrica will have four doors and four seats. No, then, this won't be a proper sports car, instead sitting somewhere between grand tourer and SUV. It'll be something designed with a bit of practicality and comfort, able to waft calmly and quietly if you like. Or, with the twist of a few knobs on the steering wheel, it's able to tighten up and get loud when you're feeling more rowdy. With somewhere north of 330 miles of range, it should make for a decent tourer, too. That comes from a 122 kWh (gross) battery pack that's split up into 15 modules, each containing 14 NMC pouch cells. The cells are initially sourced from SK On, but Ferrari made it clear they're not tied to that supplier. Indeed, the company hopes to evolve the battery pack design and chemistry over the years, keeping some version of it available for decades to come. This is, after all, a Ferrari, a machine that ostensibly will just keep getting more valuable as it ages. That, though, is a challenge currently stymying other makers of premium EVs. Can Ferrari make a truly desirable, truly premium EV? Having Jony Ive's name attached certainly doesn't hurt. We'll all have to wait until early next year to see how it looks and how it sounds. I personally won't get too excited about this car until then, but I am very glad that it even exists. Back in 2011, Luca Di Montezemelo, then-CEO of Ferrari, told me that Ferrari would never make an EV. I was skeptical of his statement back then, and 14 years later, I'm glad to see the company finally coming around.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html?src=rss",

At this point, if you subscribe to all the major services out there, you're basically paying the same price as cable — those antiquated local monopolies that streaming was supposed to save us from. But streaming still has one big advantage over the old ways: no contracts. That means you can grab a good streaming deal and then cancel without penalty. Our advice is to sign up for a service when you see a good streaming deal (or the latest season of, say, Doctor Who, Severance, Andor and/or The Last of Us). Then, when the deal ends or you've binged whatever it is you want to watch, cancel as needed. But streaming deals don't come around all that often and, when they do, it's easy to miss them thanks to...everything. So we're keeping eyes out for the best streaming deals out there and we update this guide often — so check it out the next time you have a hankering to watch something new. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Hulu + Live TV (three months) for $195 ($54 off): New and eligible returning subscribers can get three months of Hulu + Live TV at a rate of $65 per month, which is much cheaper than the standard $83-per-month rate. In addition to live TV content, this service also includes Disney+ and ESPN Select, so you're essentially getting three separate streaming services under this umbrella. We consider that to be Hulu + Live TV's edge, and we named it one of the best live TV streaming services on the market right now. The offer runs through October 23. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. YouTube TV (three months) for $219 ($30 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. DashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more. Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Also, it's worth noting that anything Disney-related will be getting a price hike soon. As of October 21, 2025, you'll pay more for Disney+, Hulu and most associated bundles. But if you subscribe now, you'll at least pay one month at the old, cheaper rate. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.

          "title": "Prime Day speaker deals are still available: Save on JBL, Bose, Ultimate Ears and more",
          "standfirst": "Amazon Prime Day is nearly over, but our audio experts are still sifting through Amazon for bargains on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable blueetooth speakers. We're always ready to argue this high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to any kind of entertainment — and with these deals on top speakers from JBL, Bose, Beats, Marshall and more, there's no excuse not to upgrade. Whether you're building a permanent setup for your home theater or chaining portable speakers together to blast dance tunes through an outdoor party venue, we bet you'll find some deals to love on this curated list. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $150 (17 percent off): This deal is a great way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love. An Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Flip 6 for $100 (23 percent off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $35 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Beats Pill for $119 (34 percent off): This Bluetooth speaker from Apple subsidiary Beats earned a score of 83 in our review and currently holds a spot in our buying guide. It’s not the best raw value on the market, and it can struggle at maximum volume, but it generally pumps out strong bass without sounding imbalanced. A stylish and water-resistant design, ample battery life and the ability to play lossless audio over a USB-C cable add to the appeal. This sizable discount matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Marshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): Marshall recently re-engineered the Acton's speaker setup by angling the tweeters outward. It paid off, especially in the Acton III, which now delivers a pleasingly wide soundscape. At 6.3 pounts, it's not technically portable, but the design makes it easy to move around — and for the eco-conscious, it's made of 70 percent recycled materials. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for. Sonos Era 100 for $180 (10 percent off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 (29 percent off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

Beats Pill for $119 (34 percent off): This Bluetooth speaker from Apple subsidiary Beats earned a score of 83 in our review and currently holds a spot in our buying guide. It’s not the best raw value on the market, and it can struggle at maximum volume, but it generally pumps out strong bass without sounding imbalanced. A stylish and water-resistant design, ample battery life and the ability to play lossless audio over a USB-C cable add to the appeal. This sizable discount matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Marshall Acton III for $200 (33 percent off): Marshall recently re-engineered the Acton's speaker setup by angling the tweeters outward. It paid off, especially in the Acton III, which now delivers a pleasingly wide soundscape. At 6.3 pounts, it's not technically portable, but the design makes it easy to move around — and for the eco-conscious, it's made of 70 percent recycled materials. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for. Sonos Era 100 for $180 (10 percent off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 (29 percent off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale tends to be a decent source of discounts for gaming gear, and the latest iteration of the “Prime Big Deal Days” event is no exception. Several games, mice, controllers and other accessories we like remain on sale as we approach the end of the two-day event, so if you just can’t wait until Black Friday, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day deals on gaming devices below. Just remember that you need to be a Prime member to access some of the offers, and that the event as a whole ends at 3AM ET on October 9. Best Prime Day video game deals Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off MSRP): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version. Metaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy. Madden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to. Best Prime Day gaming device deals Astro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off): The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low. Keychron Q3 Max mechanical keyboard for $195 ($35 off): The Keychron Q Max series is the top pick in our guide to the best mechanical keyboards, pairing an upscale (if heavy) aluminum case with a lovely typing experience and extensive customizability. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve ever seen for the tenkeyless model, but it’s a rare drop from the board’s typical street price. Other size layouts are discounted as well. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March. ASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches. PNY microSD Express Card (128GB) for $38 ($7 off): We generally recommend getting at least 256GB of storage from your Switch 2 microSD card, since recent games can fill up that space pretty quickly. But if you only want a little bit extra, this is the lowest price we’ve seen for PNY’s 128GB model. Just note that this card is technically the slowest we've tested when it came to moving games to the card from the Switch’s internal storage, though it's perfectly fine for in-game tasks. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X/S (2TB) for $190 ($170 off): It’s annoying, but the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X/S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Seagate’s model is one of the very few examples of those, and this discount marks the lowest price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant in the past year. Yes, it’s still overpriced compared to a normal SSD, but any extra savings should be welcome. Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale. Crucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-that-are-still-available-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623683.html?src=rss",

It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-gaming-deals-that-are-still-available-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623683.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, October Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have been the same or even better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For October Prime Day, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best October Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more before the sale ends tonight. Prime Day Kindle deals Kindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate. Kindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration. Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life. Kindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. Prime Day Echo deals Echo Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. Echo Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy. Echo Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals. Echo Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services. Prime Day Fire TV deals Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie. Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something. Fire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console. Prime Day Fire tablet deals Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more. Fire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case. Fire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case. Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-on-kindles-echo-speakers-fire-tv-devices-and-more-for-day-2-081210482.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It's the final day of Amazon Prime Day, but it's not too late to get a heavy discount on a traditional or robotic vacuums from Amazon. We're hoping this sale helps ease some of the more granular vacuum-related decisions. Should you go corded, cordless or robotic? Dyson, iRobot or Shark? Are there any decent robotic vacuums that aren't Roombas? (Yes.) Until the very end of the Big Deal Days sale tonight, but until the very end, we'll search for discounts as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best deals here. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Dreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (49 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Roborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 (35 percent off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet. Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 (31 percent off): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 (8 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 (35 percent off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 (37 percent off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed. Eureka Stylus Elite NEC490BL Cordless Stick Vacuum for $190 (32 percent off): Another extremely strong entry into the field of budget-friendly cordless vacuums, the Eureka Stylus Elite comes with its own self-emptying station — just plug the holding tank into the stand, and the mechanism does the rest. It also includes an anti-tangle brush roll, five layers of HEPA filtration and three modes that let you decide whether to prioritize power or battery charge length.

          "standfirst": "This is technically the third Prime-related sale of the year, after March’s spring sale and the official Prime Day in July. Amazon calls this one Prime Big Deal Days, but to you, me and most everyone else, it’s the October Prime Day sale. But it ends tonight. This guide covers tech and gadgets that go for under $50 after the discount, but only ones we recommend. These are the batteries, mice, earbuds, speakers, wall chargers and other accessories that the Engadget team has tested for our guides and reviews. Read on for Engadget’s guide to the best Prime Day tech deals for under $50. Best Prime Day deals under $50 Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. (Note: the discount here has fluctuated between $29, $35 and $43 throughout the sale.) Moft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation. PNY microSD Express (128GB) for $39 ($6 off with Prime): If you’ve gotten yourself a Switch 2 (or planning to gift one for the Holidays) you may want to get a couple microSD Express cards. They’re the only type that work with the new console, which you can read all about in our guide to Switch 2 storage. This is one of the cards we recommend. Lexar 256GB Play PRO microSD Ex for $50 ($10 off with Prime): Here’s another of our picks for a Switch 2-compatible storage card. The 512GB option is on sale too, but it’s more than $50. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Moft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work someplace away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories. UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Anker USB C Charger (Nano II 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): Anker makes some of our favorite charging accessories. This one has three USB ports, two Type C and one Type A, plus a max speed of 65 watts. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $37 ($18 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Elgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling. INIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. —> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off with Prime): Our favorite Bluetooth tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. It’s got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apple’s networks). Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Blink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. —> Want to spend no more than $25? Check out our list of super cheap Prime Day tech. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. OtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Ultimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Twelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off with Prime): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake. —> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's Prime Day gaming roundup. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-59-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531690.html?src=rss",
          "content": "This is technically the third Prime-related sale of the year, after March’s spring sale and the official Prime Day in July.

(Note: the discount here has fluctuated between $29, $35 and $43 throughout the sale.) Moft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets.

It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-59-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531690.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "While Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale has been a good opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. We're into the second and final day of the \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event, but several well-reviewed sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other name brands remain at or near their lowest prices to date. We’ve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals that are still available below, along with a few choice discounts on streaming devices we like. Just remember that some deals are exclusive to Prime subscribers. Best Prime Day 4K TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,373 ($1,309 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. You should see the full discount at checkout. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Sony Bravia 9 75-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): The Bravia 9 is Sony’s flagship mini-LED TV. It’s pricier than many OLED TVs, but most reviews say that it produces better contrast and black levels than the vast majority of non-OLED sets, with minimal light bloom around bright objects onscreen. So it’s still a strong performer in a dark room. Like the best LCD TVs, it can also get super bright, and it delivers the excellent upscaling and image processing that high-end Sony TVs are known for, so it should make old DVDs and lower-quality streams look their best. That said, the top OLED TVs still have it beat when it comes to contrast, color volume and viewing angles. It’s also not the best choice for gaming, since it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports and has slightly higher input lag than other models. But if money is no object and you don’t want to go OLED, it should satisfy. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 75-inch version. Best Prime Day streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Roku Ultra for $69 ($31 off): You’d buy the Roku Ultra if you want the Roku interface in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the company’s streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finder tool and backlit buttons. (You can buy that separately, though.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support. This deal ties an all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-still-available-on-day-2-take-up-to-500-off-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051817.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The 10 Prime Day tech deals you should shop before Day 2 ends",
          "standfirst": "This year's fall Prime Day is almost on the books. But you still have time to save on some of our favorite tech. Yes, it's October and it's a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping. But it would be remiss to ignore the upcoming festivities entirely because you can actually save some money on good gadgets during this sale. But let's be real: Amazon doesn't always make it easy to find what you're looking for. Amongst the pages and pages of bad deals you could sift through, you may come across a couple of actually good deals on tech that's worth your money to begin with. You don't have to go sifting through that nonsense though — that's where we come in. We've curated the top ten Prime Day deals on tech you should shop for before the event ends tonight. And no, not all of them will cost you an arm and a leg. Apple AirTag (four-pack) for $65 (34 percent off): If you're an iPhone user, there are really no better Bluetooth trackers than AirTags. Attach one to your keys with an AirTag holder, slip one into your wallet or throw one into the bottom of your carry-on suitcase to monitor the location of your belongings using the Find My app. As is usually the case, picking them up in a multi-pack like this is cheaper than buying just one AirTag alone. And while you're at it, you can pick up a pair of Belkin AirTag holders for less thanks to Prime Day deals, too. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. PNY microSD Express card (128GB) for $38 (15 percent off): This is really the first time we've seen Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards on sale since they started coming out in earnest earlier this year. No, you unfortunately cannot just buy any microSD card on the market and use it with your new Switch 2. The console only works with these newer cards, and thankfully they are more available now than they were back in April when the Switch 2 went on pre-order for the first time. We've tested a good number of the cards on the market today and found that they're all pretty solid, so the best microSD card for Switch 2 is the microSD Express card you can most easily afford. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. In our DJI Neo review, we praised it for its speediness and general ease of use, even for folks who have never operated a drone before. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Anker Nano portable charger (5K) with built-in USB connector for $20 ($10 off): Small? Check. Easy to use? Check. No need to remember a cable? Check. We tested this one for our battery guide and found it to be a good option for anyone who wants a no-fuss (and very compact) way to power up their phone on the go. It works particularly well with the latest iPhones, but it also works with other gear that carry USB-C charging ports. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. I bought the old version not too long ago, and it's become one of the most used pieces of tech in my house. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K 100W) for $90 ($45 off): This might be the only power bank you need if you're a commuter or you travel often. It's one of our favorites because it has a high enough capacity and wattage to power laptops (as its name suggests), and it has two built-in USB-C cables: one attached to the side, and a retractable one that extends up to two feet. That means you don't have to remember to bring a cable with you in your kit. It also has a handy display that shows the amount of charge the battery still has, and the output wattage flowing to your devices. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Plus, if you're not on the market for a new TV, it's also a good way to make an old set feel new again. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but you can get around that by stacking codes — at least, for now. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Amazon's even offering a small discount on the typical $60 price. Shark AI robot vacuum with self-empty base for $230 (58 percent off): A version of one of our favorite robot vacuums, this Shark machine has strong suction power and supports home mapping. The Shark mobile app lets you set cleaning schedules, and the self-empty base that it comes with will hold 30 days worth of dust and debris.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-10-prime-day-tech-deals-you-should-shop-before-day-2-ends-190018499.html?src=rss",
          "content": "This year's fall Prime Day is almost on the books. But you still have time to save on some of our favorite tech. Yes, it's October and it's a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping. But it would be remiss to ignore the upcoming festivities entirely because you can actually save some money on good gadgets during this sale. But let's be real: Amazon doesn't always make it easy to find what you're looking for. Amongst the pages and pages of bad deals you could sift through, you may come across a couple of actually good deals on tech that's worth your money to begin with. You don't have to go sifting through that nonsense though — that's where we come in. We've curated the top ten Prime Day deals on tech you should shop for before the event ends tonight. And no, not all of them will cost you an arm and a leg. Apple AirTag (four-pack) for $65 (34 percent off): If you're an iPhone user, there are really no better Bluetooth trackers than AirTags. Attach one to your keys with an AirTag holder, slip one into your wallet or throw one into the bottom of your carry-on suitcase to monitor the location of your belongings using the Find My app. As is usually the case, picking them up in a multi-pack like this is cheaper than buying just one AirTag alone. And while you're at it, you can pick up a pair of Belkin AirTag holders for less thanks to Prime Day deals, too. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. PNY microSD Express card (128GB) for $38 (15 percent off): This is really the first time we've seen Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards on sale since they started coming out in earnest earlier this year. No, you unfortunately cannot just buy any microSD card on the market and use it with your new Switch 2. The console only works with these newer cards, and thankfully they are more available now than they were back in April when the Switch 2 went on pre-order for the first time. We've tested a good number of the cards on the market today and found that they're all pretty solid, so the best microSD card for Switch 2 is the microSD Express card you can most easily afford. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. In our DJI Neo review, we praised it for its speediness and general ease of use, even for folks who have never operated a drone before. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Anker Nano portable charger (5K) with built-in USB connector for $20 ($10 off): Small? Check. Easy to use? Check. No need to remember a cable? Check. We tested this one for our battery guide and found it to be a good option for anyone who wants a no-fuss (and very compact) way to power up their phone on the go.

As expected, Amazon’s site is pretty overwhelming at the moment and will be for the next few hours. Even if you came prepared with a wishlist of items you hope to buy on sale, it can be easy to get distracted by the thousands of other deals available during this members-only event. If any of the items on your list happen to be tech or tech related, Engadget has you covered. We’ve scoured Amazon to find the October Prime Day deals on tech and gadgets that you can get during the final hours of the sale. Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December.

It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 (21 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Anker Nano 5K ultra-slim power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $40 ($15 off, Prime exclusive): The top pick in our guide to the best MagSafe power banks is a much better deal than the battery Apple is selling. This super-slim battery gives an extra charge to any Qi2-enabled phone (iPhones series 12 and later). We found its proportions work very well with iPhones, and its smooth, matte texture and solid build quality make it feel premium. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but for now, you can get around that by stacking codes. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Google TV Streamer 4K for $80 ($20 off): This is our current favorite streaming device thanks to its attractive design with handy remote and easy-to-use interface that gives you access to all major streaming services. It also puts a smart home control on your TV, so you can easily turn on compatible smart lights, check video feeds of security cameras and more right from your TV. Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $300 ($219 off): This is a good entry-level Dyson with strong suction power and easy handling. It has a decently sized dustbin and comes with four cleaning attachments, plus it will run up to 40 minutes on a single charge. Prime Day deals: Apple devices Apple iPad A16 for $279 ($70 off): Apple’s entry-level iPad is best for kids, casual users or anyone on a tight budget who still wants a bonafide Apple tablet. It has solid performance, double the base storage compared to previous models, great build quality and a solid battery life. Note, though, that it doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile deal for a version of last year’s model with cellular support. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Prime Day deals: Tech under $50 Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): Roku makes some of the best streaming devices available, and this small dongle gives you access to a ton of free content plus all the other streaming services you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Anker 622 5K magnetic foldable power bank with stand for $28 (42 percent off, Prime exclusive): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E. It also has double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 (47 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card 256GB for $50 (17 percent off): This is another Switch 2 microSD card that we tested that we found to be a good option if you're looking to expand storage on your new console. The 512GB model is also on sale for $100. Prime Day deals: Vacuums and smart home Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Blink makes some of our favorite security cameras, and the Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring. It can be placed outside with the right weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Levoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $70 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off): This entry-level robot vacuum is an upgraded version of one of our favorite budget robot vacuums. iRobot makes robovacs that are easy to use, even for those who have never had a machine like this, and they do a good job of cleaning up all kinds of messes, including pet hair. Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): If you're looking for an autonomous dirt-sucker that can also mop, this is a good option. It has a mopping pad and water reservoir built in, and it supports home mapping as well. Its self-emptying base can hold up to 60 days worth of debris, too. Prime Day deals: Tech and gadgets Anker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $55 (31 percent off, Prime exclusive): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): The latest version of Amazon’s color ereader has 16GB of storage, improved performance, an adjustable front light and up to eight weeks of battery life. The design is also waterproof, so you can take it to the beach or by the pool without worry. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. Amazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-36-best-prime-day-tech-deals-for-day-2-from-apple-samsung-anker-beats-google-and-more-050801203.html?src=rss",

Prime Day deals: Tech and gadgets Anker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $55 (31 percent off, Prime exclusive): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): The latest version of Amazon’s color ereader has 16GB of storage, improved performance, an adjustable front light and up to eight weeks of battery life. The design is also waterproof, so you can take it to the beach or by the pool without worry. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. Amazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/we-found-the-36-best-prime-day-tech-deals-for-day-2-from-apple-samsung-anker-beats-google-and-more-050801203.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Maybe you’re not looking to snag an iPad, a robot vacuum or a VR headset this Amazon Prime Day because you’re set with what you already have. Instead, though, consider picking up a few discounted “essential” gadgets, or really, devices you don’t want to be left without in a pinch. Charging gear falls into this camp, and Anker makes some of our favorite power banks, cables, wireless chargers and more. A bunch of Anker’s gear is on sale for October Prime Day, making now a great time to stock up. Personally, I always end up getting an extra charging cable or surge protector for my house, or I take stock of the gifts I’ll need over the next couple of months and pick up a power brick while they’re deeply discounted. Here, we’ve collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging accessories that you can still get before Prime Day ends. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "Amazon's Prime Day sale is a great time to save money on new kitchen tools — but there are only a few hours left to do so. We've combed through the thousands of deals on cooking gadgets and appliances to find the best deals on kitchen tech we've tested and recommend in our reviews and buyer's guides. We found deals on some of our top picks for rice cookers, Instant Pots, Kitchen Aid tools, air fryers and of course, the frozen dream-maker, Ninja's Creami ice cream maker. Most of these discounts will expire tonight when the sale ends, so if one of these Prime Day kitchen deals catches your eye, you may want to get it now. The best Prime Day kitchen deals KitchenAid Artisan Series Stand Mixer for $379 ($121 off): There’s a reason this is so popular among home bakers and chefs. The Artisan KitchenAid is sort of the gold standard stand mixer, as we point out in our guide to the best kitchen tech. This isn’t an all-time low (it was $350 as recently as May), but matches the July Prime Day price. Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Cosori 9-in-1 TurboBlaze Air Fryer for $90 ($30 off with Prime): This is the runner up pick in our air fryer buying guide. We appreciate the roomy basket and easy-to-use touchscreen. It’s missing the clear front window that our top pick from Instant has but, unlike that one, the Cosori has a release button on the basket which is a welcome safety feature. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40 off with Prime): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off with Prime): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker $180 ($50 off): This is one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the Creami dipped down to $160 last Black Friday but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Meater Pro wireless thermometer for $99 ($31 off with Prime): This was previously called the Meater 2 Plus, but the company changed the name. We gave it high praise in our review, and like the extended range, strong battery life, durability and precision. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $144 ($36 off with Prime): This is one of the appliances we recommend in our guide for tea gifts. I bought one based on that suggestion and have been impressed with this little kettle’s speed and good looks ever since. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $60 ($70 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. KitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May. Breville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): This is the premium pick from our guide to sous vide machines. It has a powerful 1,100-watt heater and a Turbo mode that significantly reduces cooking times. But there are no built-in controls — you’ll have to use your phone and Breville’s free app to use it. AeroPress Original for $30 ($10 off): We’re fans of AeroPress portable coffee makers and recommend the pricer Go Plus model in our guide to coffee gifts. If you don’t want to spend quite so much, grab the original model, which is even cheaper for Prime Day. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $70 ($70 off with Prime): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($30 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off with Prime): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July. Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-our-favorite-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-save-up-to-50-percent-before-the-sale-ends-193009680.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Regardless of if you need a new laptop for work or play, October Prime Day may have just what you’re looking for at a good price. Amongst the clothing, shoes, household essentials and other tech gear are some decent laptop deals that you can snag if you’re a Prime member — and even some that you can grab without a Prime subscription. But deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best October Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them during the final hours of the sale. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $979 (18 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Acer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,050 (25 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver. HP HD Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Pentium N200) for $319 (9 percent off) Acer Chromebook Plus (14-inch, Intel Core i3) for $360 (10 percent off) This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-laptop-deals-discounts-on-machines-from-apple-lenovo-dell-hp-and-more-130507738.html?src=rss",

Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $979 (18 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Acer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,050 (25 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver. HP HD Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Pentium N200) for $319 (9 percent off) Acer Chromebook Plus (14-inch, Intel Core i3) for $360 (10 percent off) This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-laptop-deals-discounts-on-machines-from-apple-lenovo-dell-hp-and-more-130507738.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has brought a number of decent discounts on Apple devices, from iPads to Apple Watches to accessories like the Apple Pencil and AirTag. If you’ve been waiting to take the plunge and don’t want to hold out until Black Friday, here are the best Apple deals from the Prime Big Deal Days event that are still available. As a refresher, today is the second and last day of the sale, and you’ll need to be a Prime member to view some of the deals. Best Prime Day Apple deals: iPads Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $437 ($162 off): We call the Air the best Apple tablet for most people in our guide to the best iPads. While it’s a good bit more expensive than the base model, it has a handful of subtle improvements that add up in day-to-day use. Its speakers are better. Its display is more color-rich, more glare-resistant and laminated, which means there’s no “gap” between the display and the actual glass. There’s a faster chip and more RAM for gaming or more involved tasks. It also works with the Apple Pencil Pro and comfier Magic Keyboard. This is the largest discount we’ve seen, but it only applies to the purple colorway. Other models are $150 off, which is still a sizable drop. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as the 11-inch model, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. It should be nice if you’re willing to trade a little portability for more space for working or taking in movies. We gave this model a score of 89 in our review back in March. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $379 ($120 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you want a display you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is another all-time low. Best Prime Day Apple deals: Macs Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Other configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This deal is slightly higher than the laptop’s all-time low, and it’s another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s a decent drop from Apple’s usual list price. Again, other versions with more memory and storage are also on sale. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint while adding a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Best Prime Day Apple deals: AirPods Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off MSRP): The entry-level AirPods get you tons of Apple-friendly features — from fast pairing with your iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri — and their lightweight design should fit most ears more comfortably than previous models. They still aren’t the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair, and they don't support wireless charging, Find My tracking or built-in volume controls. They won’t block much outside noise either. But if you’re an iPhone owner who truly hates the feeling of earphones that jut into your ear canal, they’re a worthy value with this discount, which comes within a dollar of the lowest price we’ve seen. Engadget’s Billy Steele gave the AirPods 4 a review score of 88 last year. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 ($60 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support. They have the same open-style design, so the ANC isn't as effective as what you'd get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds more useful in noisy areas all the same. This pair earned a score of 86 in our review, and the discount matches the lowest price we've tracked. Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weird, flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, they offer most of the conveniences of the in-ear AirPods, while their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s all-time low, but it’s the best price we’ve seen since July. Best Prime Day Apple deals: Apple Watches Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches last month, but Amazon is selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) for $390 ($9 off): The Series 11 is the top overall pick in our guide to the best smartwatches. It’s not as compelling as the SE 3 from a value perspective, but it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, slightly longer battery life and support for more advanced health features like hypertension alerts and an ECG app. We gave it a score of 90 in our review. Just note that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you’re happy with your current Apple Watch. This is just a $9 discount, but we note it since the Series 11 has been on sale for less than a month, so any bit of savings are welcome. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile deal for a version of last year’s model with cellular support. If you don't need cell service, the GPS-only model is also steeply discounted at $279. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since this is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters. Best Prime Day Apple deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price.

          "standfirst": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference during intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to booting your operating system. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth to process huge chunks of data in parallel, getting everything done faster while keeping your device from running too hot. Although October Prime Day is nearly over, you can still grab some of our favorite deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only are these some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time. Best Prime Day microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card 256GB (compatible with Switch 2) for $50 (17 percent off): This is another Switch 2 microSD card that we tested that we found to be a good option if you're looking to expand storage on your new console. The 512GB model is also on sale for $100. Samsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming. SanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $100 (33 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast. Lexar 256GB Professional Silver SD Card for $22 (53 percent off): The Lexar 256GB Professional Silver line serves up fast sequential read and write speeds, both in the neighborhood of 200MB/s. That's more than enough space and speed for photos and videos in a high-end camera, and comes with professional waterproofing at a very good price. Best Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 (28 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $370 (35 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Samsung 870 EVO SATA III Internal SSD 1TB for $95 (19 percent off): Samsung's 870 Evo series consists of some of the best entry-level SSD storage available. While it's not quite as fast as the Samsung 990s above, it still posts read and write speeds around 550MB/s, enough for a visible difference when organizing a media library. It's also way more affordable. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $170 (48 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 (19 percent off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. WD_BLACK 8TB SN850X for $544 (42 percent off): Honestly, we can't think of a lot of people who need an SSD with 8TB of storage — but if you're one of those people, this is the deal of a lifetime. The SN850X is both capacious and high-functioning, including both a heatsink and a digital dashboard you can use to monitor its performance. The smaller, cheaper versions are also marked down. Lexar 1TB NM790 SSD for $65 (32 percent off): You'll see Lexar a lot on this list, and for good reason — it's a good first stop for affordable, well-reviewed storage. The NM790 includes a heatsink and delivers speeds of 7,400MB/s read and 6500MB/s write. It's highly power-efficient for a 4th-gen SSD and even includes a five-year warranty. Best Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $190 (47 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier. Lexar 2TB Armor 700 for $130 (38 percent off): The Armor 700 is Lexar's USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 portable SSD, and it's on the leading edge of that hardware generation, hitting 2000 MB/s in both read and write speeds. With a cable compatible with both USB-A and USB-C, it fits basically any hardware from PCs and Macs to gaming consoles, and it's even rated for drops of up to three meters.

          "standfirst": "The same connectivity that made Anthropic&#x27;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) the fastest-adopted AI integration standard in 2025 has created enterprise cybersecurity&#x27;s most dangerous blind spot. Recent research from Pynt quantifies the growing threat in clear, unambiguous terms. Their analysis exposes the startling network effect of vulnerabilities that escalate the more MCP plugins are used. Deploying just ten MCP plugins creates a 92% probability of exploitation. At three interconnected servers, risk exceeds 50%. Even a single MCP plugin presents a 9% exploit probability, and the threat compounds exponentially with each addition.MCPs&#x27; security paradox is driving one of the enterprises&#x27; most significant AI risksThe design premise for MCP began with a commendable goal of solving AI&#x27;s integration chaos. Anthropic chose to standardize how large language models (LLMs) connect to external tools and data sources, delivering what every organization working with AI models and resources desperately needed: a universal interface for AI agents to access everything from APIs, cloud services, databases, and more. Anthropic&#x27;s launch was so well orchestrated that MCP immediately gained traction with many of the leading AI companies in the industry, including Google and Microsoft, who both quickly adopted the standard.

The MCP protocol continues to show increased vulnerabilities in different scenarios, with the main ones including the following: CVE-2025-6514 (CVSS 9.6): The MCP-remote package, downloaded over 500,000 times, carries a critical vulnerability allowing arbitrary OS command execution. \"The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger arbitrary OS command execution on the machine running MCP-remote when it initiates a connection to an untrusted MCP server, launching a full system compromise,\" warns JFrog&#x27;s security team.The Postmark MCP Backdoor: Koi Security uncovered that the postmark-mcp npm package had been trojanized to grant attackers implicit \"god-mode\" access within AI workflows. In version 1.0.16, the malicious actor inserted a single line of code that silently BCC&#x27;d every outbound email to their domain (e.g., phan@giftshop.club), effectively exfiltrating internal memos, invoices, and password resets, all without raising alerts. As Koi researchers put it: \"These MCP servers run with the same privileges as the AI assistants themselves — full email access, database connections, API permissions — yet they don&#x27;t appear in any asset inventory, skip vendor risk assessments, and bypass every security control from DLP to email gateways.\" Idan Dardikman, co-founder and CTO at Koi Security, writes in a recent blog post exposing just how lethal the postmark-mcp npm package is, \"Let me be really clear about something: MCP servers aren&#x27;t like regular npm packages.

The layers defined here look to bring together architectural safeguards and immediate operational measures to reduce an organization&#x27;s threat surface.Layer 1: Start with the weakest area of MCP which is authentication and access controls Improving authentication and access controls needs to start with enforcing OAuth 2.1 for each MCP gateway across an organization. Gartner notes that enterprises enforcing these measures report 48% fewer vulnerabilities, 30% better user adoption, and centralized MCP server monitoring. \"MCP gateways serve as essential security intermediaries,\" writes the research firm, by providing unified server catalogs and real-time monitoring. Layer 2: Why semantic layers matter in contextual securitySemantic layers are essential for bringing greater context to each access decision, ensuring AI agents work only with standardized, trusted, and verifiable data. Deploying semantic layers helps reduce operational overhead, improves natural language query accuracy, and delivers the real-time traceability security leaders need. VentureBeat is seeing the practice of embedding security policies directly into data access contribute to reduced breach risks and more secure agentic analytics workflows.Layer 3: Knowledge graphs are essential for visibilityBy definition, knowledge graphs connect entities, analytics assets, and business processes, enabling AI agents to operate transparently and securely within an organizational context. Gartner highlights this capability as critical for regulatory compliance, auditability, and trust, especially in complex queries and workflows. Merritt Baer underscores the urgency: \"If you&#x27;re using MCP today, you already need security.

          "title": "New memory framework builds AI agents that can handle the real world's unpredictability",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Google Cloud AI Research have developed a framework that enables large language model (LLM) agents to organize their experiences into a memory bank, helping them get better at complex tasks over time.The framework, called ReasoningBank, distills “generalizable reasoning strategies” from an agent’s successful and failed attempts to solve problems. The agent then uses this memory during inference to avoid repeating past mistakes and make better decisions as it faces new problems. The researchers show that when combined with test-time scaling techniques, where an agent makes multiple attempts at a problem, ReasoningBank significantly improves the performance and efficiency of LLM agents.Their findings show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms classic memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, offering a practical path toward building more adaptive and reliable AI agents for enterprise applications.The challenge of LLM agent memoryAs LLM agents are deployed in applications that run for long periods, they encounter a continuous stream of tasks. One of the key limitations of current LLM agents is their failure to learn from this accumulated experience. By approaching each task in isolation, they inevitably repeat past mistakes, discard valuable insights from related problems, and fail to develop skills that would make them more capable over time.The solution to this limitation is to give agents some kind of memory. Previous efforts to give agents memory have focused on storing past interactions for reuse by organizing information in various forms from plain text to structured graphs. However, these approaches often fall short. Many use raw interaction logs or only store successful task examples. This means they can&#x27;t distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns and, crucially, they don’t extract and use the valuable information from the agent’s failures. As the researchers note in their paper, “existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.”How ReasoningBank worksReasoningBank is a memory framework designed to overcome these limitations. Its central idea is to distill useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items that can be stored and reused.According to Jun Yan, a Research Scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this marks a fundamental shift in how agents operate. \"Traditional agents operate statically—each task is processed in isolation,\" Yan explained. \"ReasoningBank changes this by turning every task experience (successful or failed) into structured, reusable reasoning memory. As a result, the agent doesn’t start from scratch with each customer; it recalls and adapts proven strategies from similar past cases.\"The framework processes both successful and failed experiences and turns them into a collection of useful strategies and preventive lessons. The agent judges success and failure through LLM-as-a-judge schemes to obviate the need for human labeling.Yan provides a practical example of this process in action. An agent tasked with finding Sony headphones might fail because its broad search query returns over 4,000 irrelevant products. \"ReasoningBank will first try to figure out why this approach failed,\" Yan said. \"It will then distill strategies such as ‘optimize search query’ and ‘confine products with category filtering.’ Those strategies will be extremely useful to get future similar tasks successfully done.\"The process operates in a closed loop. When an agent faces a new task, it uses an embedding-based search to retrieve relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. These memories are inserted into the agent’s system prompt, providing context for its decision-making. Once the task is completed, the framework creates new memory items to extract insights from successes and failures. This new knowledge is then analyzed, distilled, and merged into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its capabilities.Supercharging memory with scalingThe researchers found a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Classic test-time scaling involves generating multiple independent answers to the same question, but the researchers argue that this “vanilla form is suboptimal because it does not leverage inherent contrastive signal that arises from redundant exploration on the same problem.”To address this, they propose Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which integrates scaling with ReasoningBank. MaTTS comes in two forms. In “parallel scaling,” the system generates multiple trajectories for the same query, then compares and contrasts them to identify consistent reasoning patterns. In sequential scaling, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning within a single attempt, with the intermediate notes and corrections also serving as valuable memory signals.This creates a virtuous cycle: the existing memory in ReasoningBank steers the agent toward more promising solutions, while the diverse experiences generated through scaling enable the agent to create higher-quality memories to store in ReasoningBank. “This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents,” the researchers write.ReasoningBank in actionThe researchers tested their framework on WebArena (web browsing) and SWE-Bench-Verified (software engineering) benchmarks, using models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. They compared ReasoningBank against baselines including memory-free agents and agents using trajectory-based or workflow-based memory frameworks.The results show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms these baselines across all datasets and LLM backbones. On WebArena, it improved the overall success rate by up to 8.3 percentage points compared to a memory-free agent. It also generalized better on more difficult, cross-domain tasks, while reducing the number of interaction steps needed to complete tasks. When combined with MaTTS, both parallel and sequential scaling further boosted performance, consistently outperforming standard test-time scaling.This efficiency gain has a direct impact on operational costs. Yan points to a case where a memory-free agent took eight trial-and-error steps just to find the right product filter on a website. \"Those trial and error costs could be avoided by leveraging relevant insights from ReasoningBank,\" he noted. \"In this case, we save almost twice the operational costs,\" which also improves the user experience by resolving issues faster.For enterprises, ReasoningBank can help develop cost-effective agents that can learn from experience and adapt over time in complex workflows and areas like software development, customer support, and data analysis. As the paper concludes, “Our findings suggest a practical pathway toward building adaptive and lifelong-learning agents.”Yan confirmed that their findings point toward a future of truly compositional intelligence. For example, a coding agent could learn discrete skills like API integration and database management from separate tasks. \"Over time, these modular skills... become building blocks the agent can flexibly recombine to solve more complex tasks,\" he said, suggesting a future where agents can autonomously assemble their knowledge to manage entire workflows with minimal human oversight.",
          "content": "Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Google Cloud AI Research have developed a framework that enables large language model (LLM) agents to organize their experiences into a memory bank, helping them get better at complex tasks over time.The framework, called ReasoningBank, distills “generalizable reasoning strategies” from an agent’s successful and failed attempts to solve problems. The agent then uses this memory during inference to avoid repeating past mistakes and make better decisions as it faces new problems. The researchers show that when combined with test-time scaling techniques, where an agent makes multiple attempts at a problem, ReasoningBank significantly improves the performance and efficiency of LLM agents.Their findings show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms classic memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, offering a practical path toward building more adaptive and reliable AI agents for enterprise applications.The challenge of LLM agent memoryAs LLM agents are deployed in applications that run for long periods, they encounter a continuous stream of tasks. One of the key limitations of current LLM agents is their failure to learn from this accumulated experience. By approaching each task in isolation, they inevitably repeat past mistakes, discard valuable insights from related problems, and fail to develop skills that would make them more capable over time.The solution to this limitation is to give agents some kind of memory. Previous efforts to give agents memory have focused on storing past interactions for reuse by organizing information in various forms from plain text to structured graphs. However, these approaches often fall short. Many use raw interaction logs or only store successful task examples. This means they can&#x27;t distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns and, crucially, they don’t extract and use the valuable information from the agent’s failures. As the researchers note in their paper, “existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.”How ReasoningBank worksReasoningBank is a memory framework designed to overcome these limitations. Its central idea is to distill useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items that can be stored and reused.According to Jun Yan, a Research Scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this marks a fundamental shift in how agents operate. \"Traditional agents operate statically—each task is processed in isolation,\" Yan explained. \"ReasoningBank changes this by turning every task experience (successful or failed) into structured, reusable reasoning memory. As a result, the agent doesn’t start from scratch with each customer; it recalls and adapts proven strategies from similar past cases.\"The framework processes both successful and failed experiences and turns them into a collection of useful strategies and preventive lessons. The agent judges success and failure through LLM-as-a-judge schemes to obviate the need for human labeling.Yan provides a practical example of this process in action. An agent tasked with finding Sony headphones might fail because its broad search query returns over 4,000 irrelevant products. \"ReasoningBank will first try to figure out why this approach failed,\" Yan said. \"It will then distill strategies such as ‘optimize search query’ and ‘confine products with category filtering.’ Those strategies will be extremely useful to get future similar tasks successfully done.\"The process operates in a closed loop. When an agent faces a new task, it uses an embedding-based search to retrieve relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. These memories are inserted into the agent’s system prompt, providing context for its decision-making. Once the task is completed, the framework creates new memory items to extract insights from successes and failures. This new knowledge is then analyzed, distilled, and merged into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its capabilities.Supercharging memory with scalingThe researchers found a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Classic test-time scaling involves generating multiple independent answers to the same question, but the researchers argue that this “vanilla form is suboptimal because it does not leverage inherent contrastive signal that arises from redundant exploration on the same problem.”To address this, they propose Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which integrates scaling with ReasoningBank. MaTTS comes in two forms. In “parallel scaling,” the system generates multiple trajectories for the same query, then compares and contrasts them to identify consistent reasoning patterns. In sequential scaling, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning within a single attempt, with the intermediate notes and corrections also serving as valuable memory signals.This creates a virtuous cycle: the existing memory in ReasoningBank steers the agent toward more promising solutions, while the diverse experiences generated through scaling enable the agent to create higher-quality memories to store in ReasoningBank. “This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents,” the researchers write.ReasoningBank in actionThe researchers tested their framework on WebArena (web browsing) and SWE-Bench-Verified (software engineering) benchmarks, using models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. They compared ReasoningBank against baselines including memory-free agents and agents using trajectory-based or workflow-based memory frameworks.The results show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms these baselines across all datasets and LLM backbones. On WebArena, it improved the overall success rate by up to 8.3 percentage points compared to a memory-free agent. It also generalized better on more difficult, cross-domain tasks, while reducing the number of interaction steps needed to complete tasks. When combined with MaTTS, both parallel and sequential scaling further boosted performance, consistently outperforming standard test-time scaling.This efficiency gain has a direct impact on operational costs. Yan points to a case where a memory-free agent took eight trial-and-error steps just to find the right product filter on a website. \"Those trial and error costs could be avoided by leveraging relevant insights from ReasoningBank,\" he noted. \"In this case, we save almost twice the operational costs,\" which also improves the user experience by resolving issues faster.For enterprises, ReasoningBank can help develop cost-effective agents that can learn from experience and adapt over time in complex workflows and areas like software development, customer support, and data analysis.

          "standfirst": "Amazon's third (!) and final Prime-related sale of 2025 has reached its last few hours. But the October Prime Day sale still has plenty of nifty accessories, gadgets and tech that can be had for less than $25. You might not think many electronics could be worth your time for so cheap, but turns out there are some worthy contenders. We found deals on Bluetooth trackers, mini speakers, portable chargers, cables, streaming sticks and more — all pulled from Engadget's own testing for our guides and reviews. Most deals will likely end when the sale does, so shop these under $25 Prime Day tech deals while you can. Prime Day tech deals under $25 Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Apple AirTag for $20 ($9 off): Here’s our pick for a Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. These little discs have the most accurate finding ability of any fob we tested, thanks to Apple’s vast Find My network that taps into all nearby iPhones to track down your missing stuff. They could be louder and a hole would be nice, but nothing beats its accuracy. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off): Our favorite tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. It’s got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apple’s networks). The deal isn’t an all-time low; it went as low as $15 back in July and only the white model is down to $20 right now. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 ($16 off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Moft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17 ($13 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-tech-deals-under-25-save-on-blink-anker-roku-and-fire-tv-084136589.html?src=rss",

          "title": "To scale agentic AI, Notion tore down its tech stack and started fresh",
          "standfirst": "Many organizations would be hesitant to overhaul their tech stack and start from scratch. Not Notion. For the 3.0 version of its productivity software (released in September), the company didn’t hesitate to rebuild from the ground up; they recognized that it was necessary, in fact, to support agentic AI at enterprise scale. Whereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. “Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We&#x27;ve rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomouslyNotion has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel. In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the company identified the need to move beyond simpler, task-based workflows to goal-oriented reasoning systems that allow agents to autonomously select, orchestrate, and execute tools across connected environments. Very quickly, reasoning models have become “far better” at learning to use tools and follow chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions, Sachs noted. This allows them to be “far more independent” and make multiple decisions within one agentic workflow. “We rebuilt our AI system to play to that,\" she said. From an engineering perspective, this meant replacing rigid prompt-based flows with a unified orchestration model, Sachs explained. This core model is supported by modular sub-agents that search Notion and the web, query and add to databases and edit content. Each agent uses tools contextually; for instance, they can decide whether to search Notion itself, or another platform like Slack. The model will perform successive searches until the relevant information is found. It can then, for instance, convert notes into proposals, create follow-up messages, track tasks, and spot and make updates in knowledge bases. In Notion 2.0, the team focused on having AI perform specific tasks, which required them to “think exhaustively” about how to prompt the model, Sachs noted. However, with version 3.0, users can assign tasks to agents, and agents can actually take action and perform multiple tasks concurrently. “We reorchestrated it to be self-selecting on the tools, rather than few-shotting, which is explicitly prompting how to go through all these different scenarios,” Sachs explained. The aim is to ensure everything interfaces with AI and that “anything you can do, your Notion agent can do.”Bifurcating to isolate hallucinationsNotion’s philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper,” drives a continuous iteration cycle that balances latency and accuracy through fine-tuned vector embeddings and elastic search optimization. Sachs’ team employs a rigorous evaluation framework that combines deterministic tests, vernacular optimization, human-annotated data and LLMs-as-a-judge, with model-based scoring identifying discrepancies and inaccuracies. “By bifurcating the evaluation, we&#x27;re able to identify where the problems come from, and that helps us isolate unnecessary hallucinations,” Sachs explained. Further, making the architecture itself simpler means it’s easier to make changes as models and techniques evolve. “We optimize latency and parallel thinking as much as possible,” which leads to “way better accuracy,” Sachs noted. Models are grounded in data from the web and the Notion connected workspace. Ultimately, Sachs reported, the investment in rebuilding its architecture has already provided Notion returns in terms of capability and faster rate of change. She added, “We are fully open to rebuilding it again, when the next breakthrough happens, if we have to.”Understanding contextual latencyWhen building and fine-tuning models, it’s important to understand that latency is subjective: AI must provide the most relevant information, not necessarily the most, at the cost of speed. “You&#x27;d be surprised at the different ways customers are willing to wait for things and not wait for things,” Sachs said. It makes for an interesting experiment: How slow can you go before people abandon the model? With pure navigational search, for instance, users may not be as patient; they want answers near-immediately. “If you ask, ‘What&#x27;s two plus two,’ you don&#x27;t want to wait for your agent to be searching everywhere in Slack and JIRA,” Sachs pointed out. But the longer the time it&#x27;s given, the more exhaustive a reasoning agent can be. For instance, Notion can perform 20 minutes of autonomous work across hundreds of websites, files and other materials. In these instances, users are more willing to wait, Sachs explained; they allow the model to execute in the background while they attend to other tasks. “It&#x27;s a product question,” said Sachs. “How do we set user expectations from the UI? How do we ascertain user expectations on latency?”Notion is its biggest userNotion understands the importance of using its own product — in fact, its employees are among its biggest power users. Sachs explained that teams have active sandboxes that generate training and evaluation data, as well as a “really active” thumbs-up-thumbs-down user feedback loop. Users aren’t shy about saying what they think should be improved or features they’d like to see. Sachs emphasized that when a user thumbs down an interaction, they are explicitly giving permission to a human annotator to analyze that interaction in a way that de-anonymizes them as much as possible. “We are using our own tool as a company all day, every day, and so we get really fast feedback loops,” said Sachs. “We’re really dogfooding our own product.” That said, it’s their own product they’re building, Sachs noted, so they understand that they may have goggles on when it comes to quality and functionality. To balance this out, Notion has trusted \"very AI-savvy\" design partners who are granted early access to new capabilities and provide important feedback. Sachs emphasized that this is just as important as internal prototyping. “We&#x27;re all about experimenting in the open, I think you get much richer feedback,” said Sachs. “Because at the end of the day, if we just look at how Notion uses Notion, we&#x27;re not really giving the best experience to our customers.” Just as importantly, continuous internal testing allows teams to evaluate progressions and make sure models aren&#x27;t regressing (when accuracy and performance degrades over time). \"Everything you&#x27;re doing stays faithful,\" Sachs explained. \"You know that your latency is within bounds.\" Many companies make the mistake of focusing too intensely on retroactively-focused evans; this makes it difficult for them to understand how or where they&#x27;re improving, Sachs pointed out. Notion considers evals as a \"litmus test\" of development and forward-looking progression and evals of observability and regression proofing. “I think a big mistake a lot of companies make is conflating the two,” said Sachs. “We use them for both purposes; we think about them really differently.”Takeaways from Notion&#x27;s journeyFor enterprises, Notion can serve as a blueprint for how to responsibly and dynamically operationalize agentic AI in a connected, permissioned enterprise workspace. Sach’s takeaways for other tech leaders: Don’t be afraid to rebuild when foundational capabilities change; Notion fully re-engineered its architecture to align with reasoning-based models.Treat latency as contextual: Optimize per use case, rather than universally. Ground all outputs in trustworthy, curated enterprise data to ensure accuracy and trust. She advised: “Be willing to make the hard decisions. Be willing to sit at the top of the frontier, so to speak, on what you&#x27;re developing to build the best product you can for your customers.”",

Whereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. “Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We&#x27;ve rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomouslyNotion has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel. In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the company identified the need to move beyond simpler, task-based workflows to goal-oriented reasoning systems that allow agents to autonomously select, orchestrate, and execute tools across connected environments. Very quickly, reasoning models have become “far better” at learning to use tools and follow chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions, Sachs noted. This allows them to be “far more independent” and make multiple decisions within one agentic workflow. “We rebuilt our AI system to play to that,\" she said. From an engineering perspective, this meant replacing rigid prompt-based flows with a unified orchestration model, Sachs explained. This core model is supported by modular sub-agents that search Notion and the web, query and add to databases and edit content. Each agent uses tools contextually; for instance, they can decide whether to search Notion itself, or another platform like Slack. The model will perform successive searches until the relevant information is found. It can then, for instance, convert notes into proposals, create follow-up messages, track tasks, and spot and make updates in knowledge bases. In Notion 2.0, the team focused on having AI perform specific tasks, which required them to “think exhaustively” about how to prompt the model, Sachs noted. However, with version 3.0, users can assign tasks to agents, and agents can actually take action and perform multiple tasks concurrently. “We reorchestrated it to be self-selecting on the tools, rather than few-shotting, which is explicitly prompting how to go through all these different scenarios,” Sachs explained. The aim is to ensure everything interfaces with AI and that “anything you can do, your Notion agent can do.”Bifurcating to isolate hallucinationsNotion’s philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper,” drives a continuous iteration cycle that balances latency and accuracy through fine-tuned vector embeddings and elastic search optimization. Sachs’ team employs a rigorous evaluation framework that combines deterministic tests, vernacular optimization, human-annotated data and LLMs-as-a-judge, with model-based scoring identifying discrepancies and inaccuracies. “By bifurcating the evaluation, we&#x27;re able to identify where the problems come from, and that helps us isolate unnecessary hallucinations,” Sachs explained. Further, making the architecture itself simpler means it’s easier to make changes as models and techniques evolve. “We optimize latency and parallel thinking as much as possible,” which leads to “way better accuracy,” Sachs noted. Models are grounded in data from the web and the Notion connected workspace. Ultimately, Sachs reported, the investment in rebuilding its architecture has already provided Notion returns in terms of capability and faster rate of change. She added, “We are fully open to rebuilding it again, when the next breakthrough happens, if we have to.”Understanding contextual latencyWhen building and fine-tuning models, it’s important to understand that latency is subjective: AI must provide the most relevant information, not necessarily the most, at the cost of speed. “You&#x27;d be surprised at the different ways customers are willing to wait for things and not wait for things,” Sachs said. It makes for an interesting experiment: How slow can you go before people abandon the model? With pure navigational search, for instance, users may not be as patient; they want answers near-immediately. “If you ask, ‘What&#x27;s two plus two,’ you don&#x27;t want to wait for your agent to be searching everywhere in Slack and JIRA,” Sachs pointed out. But the longer the time it&#x27;s given, the more exhaustive a reasoning agent can be. For instance, Notion can perform 20 minutes of autonomous work across hundreds of websites, files and other materials. In these instances, users are more willing to wait, Sachs explained; they allow the model to execute in the background while they attend to other tasks. “It&#x27;s a product question,” said Sachs. “How do we set user expectations from the UI? How do we ascertain user expectations on latency?”Notion is its biggest userNotion understands the importance of using its own product — in fact, its employees are among its biggest power users. Sachs explained that teams have active sandboxes that generate training and evaluation data, as well as a “really active” thumbs-up-thumbs-down user feedback loop. Users aren’t shy about saying what they think should be improved or features they’d like to see. Sachs emphasized that when a user thumbs down an interaction, they are explicitly giving permission to a human annotator to analyze that interaction in a way that de-anonymizes them as much as possible. “We are using our own tool as a company all day, every day, and so we get really fast feedback loops,” said Sachs. “We’re really dogfooding our own product.” That said, it’s their own product they’re building, Sachs noted, so they understand that they may have goggles on when it comes to quality and functionality. To balance this out, Notion has trusted \"very AI-savvy\" design partners who are granted early access to new capabilities and provide important feedback. Sachs emphasized that this is just as important as internal prototyping. “We&#x27;re all about experimenting in the open, I think you get much richer feedback,” said Sachs. “Because at the end of the day, if we just look at how Notion uses Notion, we&#x27;re not really giving the best experience to our customers.” Just as importantly, continuous internal testing allows teams to evaluate progressions and make sure models aren&#x27;t regressing (when accuracy and performance degrades over time). \"Everything you&#x27;re doing stays faithful,\" Sachs explained. \"You know that your latency is within bounds.\" Many companies make the mistake of focusing too intensely on retroactively-focused evans; this makes it difficult for them to understand how or where they&#x27;re improving, Sachs pointed out. Notion considers evals as a \"litmus test\" of development and forward-looking progression and evals of observability and regression proofing. “I think a big mistake a lot of companies make is conflating the two,” said Sachs. “We use them for both purposes; we think about them really differently.”Takeaways from Notion&#x27;s journeyFor enterprises, Notion can serve as a blueprint for how to responsibly and dynamically operationalize agentic AI in a connected, permissioned enterprise workspace. Sach’s takeaways for other tech leaders: Don’t be afraid to rebuild when foundational capabilities change; Notion fully re-engineered its architecture to align with reasoning-based models.Treat latency as contextual: Optimize per use case, rather than universally. Ground all outputs in trustworthy, curated enterprise data to ensure accuracy and trust. She advised: “Be willing to make the hard decisions. Be willing to sit at the top of the frontier, so to speak, on what you&#x27;re developing to build the best product you can for your customers.”",

          "standfirst": "It's safe to say the Nintendo Switch 2 is the game console to get this year, and if you already got your hands on one, you've probably loaded it up with all your old Switch games and new Switch 2 games. If you haven't thought about adding more storage to the console, now's the time to do so. The Switch 2, unfortunately and inconveniently, cannot work with just any old microSD card — it only works with newer microSD Express cards. But thanks to Prime Day, you can actually pick up one of these new cards on sale. The most affordable of the bunch is this 128GB PNY microSD Express card, which is 15 percent off for Prime members and down to $38. Engadget's Jeff Dunn has been testing microSD Express cards since the Switch 2 launched. The best microSD Express card for Switch 2 at the moment is really the one you can most easily afford. While the cards he's tried out so far didn't perform identically in our benchmark tests, the differences in overall performance and load times will be tough for most people to notice. Thankfully, the ones he's tested so far have been good — there isn't a bad one in the bunch, and while the most consistent performer was the SanDisk microSD Express card, you won't really sacrifice by getting a different one. In fact, at least in the case of Prime Day deals, you'll be gaining by saving some cash. PNY's card in particular was actually slightly faster than SanDisk's in our testing when it came to moving games from the card back to the Switch 2's internal storage. However, it was a bit slower in writing games to the card itself. That just means you may wait a few extra minutes before you can open Mario Kart World and get to racing, but for most people, the difference will be negligible. Also on sale for Prime Day are two configurations of Lexar's Play Pro microSD card. The 256GB version is down to $50, while the 512GB model is on sale for $100. That's 17 percent off each and the lowest they've been. If you're hoping to make a one-and-done purchase and you already plan on packing your console with the best Switch 2 games, we'd recommend getting the card with the highest capacity that's still within your budget.

          "standfirst": "A virtual private network (VPN) can come in handy in lots of ways every day, whether you're using one to stream foreign TV shows or keeping yourself anonymous online so advertisers can't track you. But while we strongly recommend using a VPN, it pays to do some research before investing in one. Pricing can be opaque for these services, but there are great deals to be had. VPN provides often provide deep discounts to those willing to sign up for one or two years at a time. Though you're on the hook for the full charge up front, you're actually paying less per month over time. This way, VPN providers boost their subscriber numbers, and you get heavy price cuts on some of our favorite services. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now. Best VPN deals NordVPN — $83.43 for a two-year subscription with three months free (77 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. Although I'm sad to see it shutting down Meshnet, NordVPN still includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 77 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months — but there's no expiration date, so you have a little time for comparison shopping. ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. It's the lowest I've seen ExpressVPN go in some time, though like NordVPN, it's not on a ticking clock. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark Starter+ — $59.13 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): If you want some of the extra features of the Surfshark suite but aren't interested in jumping all the way to Surfshark One, try this intermediate tier instead. Starter+ includes Alternative ID, which you can use to mask your details when you sign up for online accounts, and Surfshark Search, a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking. This is another year-round deal that works out to an 86 percent discount. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (86 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This evergreen deal gives you 86 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with two months free (73 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. However, if you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. What makes a good VPN deal Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

Surfshark has a more closely connected server network than most VPNs, so it can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark Starter+ — $59.13 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): If you want some of the extra features of the Surfshark suite but aren't interested in jumping all the way to Surfshark One, try this intermediate tier instead. Starter+ includes Alternative ID, which you can use to mask your details when you sign up for online accounts, and Surfshark Search, a private search engine with no ads or activity tracking. This is another year-round deal that works out to an 86 percent discount. Surfshark One — $67.23 for a two-year subscription with three months free (86 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the previous tier. This evergreen deal gives you 86 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — while it's not totally clear what it does to optimize them, I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with three months free (83 percent off): It's a bit hard to find (the link at the start of this paragraph includes the coupon), but Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 39 months of PIA for a little bit over $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA almost never comes off as a budget VPN, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with two months free (73 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. However, if you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. What makes a good VPN deal Like I said in the intro, practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions the whole year round. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

Do you just want a big screen for streaming and web browsing? Do you want to use it like a pseudo-laptop? Do you care about Apple Intelligence at all? If you’re not sure, allow us to help. We’ve tested every iPad available today and broken down which ones should best fit your needs below. Table of contents The best iPads for 2025 How we test the best iPads iPad FAQs Recent updates The best iPads for 2025 How we test the best iPads The top edge of the iPad mini. Photo by Nathan Ingraham / Engadget Much like we do for our guide to the best tablets overall, we spend several days with each iPad to see how they feel and perform with different tasks: watching videos, web browsing, playing both casual and graphically intense games, editing 4K photos and video, running multiple apps side-by-side, making FaceTime calls and the like. To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff. To help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others. iPad FAQs The iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What are some new features coming to iPadOS 26? Apple released the latest update to its iPad operating system, iPadOS 26, in September. The update is a fairly significant overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It also uses the new “liquid glass” design language that Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. That said, it completely removed the “slide over” and “split view” modes found in previous versions of iPadOS, which can make quickly viewing multiple apps at once a little more cumbersome. (Though the former will now return in an upcoming update.) Notably, most of these features are available across Apple’s tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s overview page. How long do iPads typically last? If history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 26 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum. What’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air? Compared to the standard iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance prospects, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6. Starting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets? The operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS (though the former may no longer be an option in the coming months). Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer. But we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices. Can an iPad replace a laptop? This is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad. Broadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. The recent iPadOS 26 update does close the gap a bit, though it’s still not quite as fluid. Safari on the iPad isn’t fully on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. How do I take a screenshot on an iPad? As we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.

          "standfirst": "In a packed theater at Fort Mason, after a whirlwind keynote of product announcements, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sat down with Sir Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple&#x27;s most iconic products. The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new \"family\" of AI-powered devices.The partnership, solidified by OpenAI&#x27;s staggering $6.5 billion acquisition of Ive&#x27;s hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.For nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life&#x27;s work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.Jony Ive&#x27;s post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPTThe collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective, LoveFrom.\"With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,\" Ive said. \"We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing... I&#x27;ve never in my career come across anything vaguely like the affordance, like the capability that we&#x27;re now starting to sense.\"This capability, he argued, demands a fundamental rethinking of the devices we use, which he described as \"legacy products\" from a bygone era. The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.\"The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,\" Ive said. \"We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.\"An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxietyThe most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.\"I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,\" Ive began, before adding, \"When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.\"Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. \"I know I should care about productivity, and I do,\" he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools \"make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.\"He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. \"We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,\" he stated. \"We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.\"Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challengeWhile the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about technical hurdles and philosophical debates delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.\"The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas. And the challenge is trying to focus,\" Ive confessed.\"I used to be good at that, and I&#x27;ve lost some confidence, because the choices are, it&#x27;ll be easy if you really knew there were three good ones... it&#x27;s just not like that.\"This admission provides context to reports that the team is grappling with unresolved issues around the device&#x27;s \"personality\" and computing infrastructure. The goal, according to one source, is to create an AI companion that is \"accessible but not intrusive,\" avoiding the pitfalls of a \"weird AI girlfriend.\"Beyond the screen: Ive&#x27;s design philosophy for an &#x27;inevitable&#x27; AI deviceWhile no devices were shown, the conversation and prior reports offer clues. The project involves a \"family of devices,\" not a single gadget.It will likely be a departure from the screen-centric world we inhabit. Reports suggest a \"palm-sized device without a screen\" that relies on cameras and microphones to perceive its environment.Ive argued that it would be \"absurd\" to assume that today&#x27;s breathtaking AI technology should be delivered through \"products that are decades old.\" The goal is to create something that feels entirely new, yet completely natural.\"It should seem inevitable. It should seem obvious, as if there wasn&#x27;t possibly another rational solution to the problem,\" Ive said, echoing a design philosophy often attributed to his time with Steve Jobs.He also spoke of bringing a sense of joy and whimsy back to technology, pushing back against a culture he feels has become overly serious.\"In terms of the interfaces we design, if we can&#x27;t smile honestly, if it&#x27;s just another deeply serious sort of exclusive thing, I think that would do us all a huge disservice,\" he remarked.The chat concluded without a product reveal, leaving the audience with a philosophical blueprint rather than a technical one. The central narrative is clear: Jony Ive, the designer who put a screen in every pocket, is now betting on a screenless future, powered by OpenAI&#x27;s formidable intelligence, to make us all a little less anxious and a little more human.",

The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.\"The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,\" Ive said. \"We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.\"An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxietyThe most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.\"I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,\" Ive began, before adding, \"When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.\"Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. \"I know I should care about productivity, and I do,\" he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools \"make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.\"He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. \"We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,\" he stated. \"We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.\"Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challengeWhile the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about technical hurdles and philosophical debates delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.\"The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas. And the challenge is trying to focus,\" Ive confessed.\"I used to be good at that, and I&#x27;ve lost some confidence, because the choices are, it&#x27;ll be easy if you really knew there were three good ones... it&#x27;s just not like that.\"This admission provides context to reports that the team is grappling with unresolved issues around the device&#x27;s \"personality\" and computing infrastructure. The goal, according to one source, is to create an AI companion that is \"accessible but not intrusive,\" avoiding the pitfalls of a \"weird AI girlfriend.\"Beyond the screen: Ive&#x27;s design philosophy for an &#x27;inevitable&#x27; AI deviceWhile no devices were shown, the conversation and prior reports offer clues. The project involves a \"family of devices,\" not a single gadget.It will likely be a departure from the screen-centric world we inhabit. Reports suggest a \"palm-sized device without a screen\" that relies on cameras and microphones to perceive its environment.Ive argued that it would be \"absurd\" to assume that today&#x27;s breathtaking AI technology should be delivered through \"products that are decades old.\" The goal is to create something that feels entirely new, yet completely natural.\"It should seem inevitable. It should seem obvious, as if there wasn&#x27;t possibly another rational solution to the problem,\" Ive said, echoing a design philosophy often attributed to his time with Steve Jobs.He also spoke of bringing a sense of joy and whimsy back to technology, pushing back against a culture he feels has become overly serious.\"In terms of the interfaces we design, if we can&#x27;t smile honestly, if it&#x27;s just another deeply serious sort of exclusive thing, I think that would do us all a huge disservice,\" he remarked.The chat concluded without a product reveal, leaving the audience with a philosophical blueprint rather than a technical one. The central narrative is clear: Jony Ive, the designer who put a screen in every pocket, is now betting on a screenless future, powered by OpenAI&#x27;s formidable intelligence, to make us all a little less anxious and a little more human.",

          "standfirst": "The trend of AI researchers developing new, small open source generative models that outperform far larger, proprietary peers continued this week with yet another staggering advancement.Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Senior AI Researcher at Samsung&#x27;s Advanced​ Institute of Technology (SAIT) in Montreal, Canada,​ has introduced the Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) — a neural network so small it contains just 7 million parameters (internal model settings), yet it competes with or surpasses cutting-edge language models 10,000 times larger in terms of their parameter count, including OpenAI&#x27;s o3-mini and Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro, on some of the toughest reasoning benchmarks in AI research. The goal is to show that very highly performant new AI models can be created affordably without massive investments in the graphics processing units (GPUs) and power needed to train the larger, multi-trillion parameter flagship models powering many LLM chatbots today. The results were described in a research paper published on open access website arxiv.org, entitled \"Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks.\"\"The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to solve hard tasks is a trap,\" wrote Jolicoeur-Martineau on the social network X. \"Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction.\"Jolicoeur-Martineau also added: \"With recursive reasoning, it turns out that &#x27;less is more&#x27;. A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.\"TRM&#x27;s code is available now on Github under an enterprise-friendly, commercially viable MIT License — meaning anyone from researchers to companies can take, modify it, and deploy it for their own purposes, even commercial applications.One Big CaveatHowever, readers should be aware that TRM was designed specifically to perform well on structured, visual, grid-based problems like Sudoku, mazes, and puzzles on the ARC (Abstract and Reasoning Corpus)-AGI benchmark, the latter which offers tasks that should be easy for humans but difficult for AI models, such sorting colors on a grid based on a prior, but not identical, solution. From Hierarchy to SimplicityThe TRM architecture represents a radical simplification. It builds upon a technique called Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) introduced earlier this year, which showed that small networks could tackle logical puzzles like Sudoku and mazes. HRM relied on two cooperating networks—one operating at high frequency, the other at low—supported by biologically inspired arguments and mathematical justifications involving fixed-point theorems. Jolicoeur-Martineau found this unnecessarily complicated.TRM strips these elements away. Instead of two networks, it uses a single two-layer model that recursively refines its own predictions. The model begins with an embedded question and an initial answer, represented by variables x, y, and z. Through a series of reasoning steps, it updates its internal latent representation z and refines the answer y until it converges on a stable output. Each iteration corrects potential errors from the previous step, yielding a self-improving reasoning process without extra hierarchy or mathematical overhead.How Recursion Replaces ScaleThe core idea behind TRM is that recursion can substitute for depth and size.By iteratively reasoning over its own output, the network effectively simulates a much deeper architecture without the associated memory or computational cost. This recursive cycle, run over as many as sixteen supervision steps, allows the model to make progressively better predictions — similar in spirit to how large language models use multi-step “chain-of-thought” reasoning, but achieved here with a compact, feed-forward design.The simplicity pays off in both efficiency and generalization. The model uses fewer layers, no fixed-point approximations, and no dual-network hierarchy. A lightweight halting mechanism decides when to stop refining, preventing wasted computation while maintaining accuracy.Performance That Punches Above Its WeightDespite its small footprint, TRM delivers benchmark results that rival or exceed models millions of times larger. In testing, the model achieved:87.4% accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme (up from 55% for HRM)85% accuracy on Maze-Hard puzzles45% accuracy on ARC-AGI-18% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2These results surpass or closely match performance from several high-end large language models, including DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3-mini, despite TRM using less than 0.01% of their parameters.Such results suggest that recursive reasoning, not scale, may be the key to handling abstract and combinatorial reasoning problems — domains where even top-tier generative models often stumble.Design Philosophy: Less Is MoreTRM’s success stems from deliberate minimalism. Jolicoeur-Martineau found that reducing complexity led to better generalization. When the researcher increased layer count or model size, performance declined due to overfitting on small datasets. By contrast, the two-layer structure, combined with recursive depth and deep supervision, achieved optimal results.The model also performed better when self-attention was replaced with a simpler multilayer perceptron on tasks with small, fixed contexts like Sudoku. For larger grids, such as ARC puzzles, self-attention remained valuable. These findings underline that model architecture should match data structure and scale rather than default to maximal capacity.Training Small, Thinking BigTRM is now officially available as open source under an MIT license on GitHub.The repository includes full training and evaluation scripts, dataset builders for Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI, and reference configurations for reproducing the published results. It also documents compute requirements ranging from a single NVIDIA L40S GPU for Sudoku training to multi-GPU H100 setups for ARC-AGI experiments.The open release confirms that TRM is designed specifically for structured, grid-based reasoning tasks rather than general-purpose language modeling. Each benchmark — Sudoku-Extreme, Maze-Hard, and ARC-AGI — uses small, well-defined input–output grids, aligning with the model’s recursive supervision process. Training involves substantial data augmentation (such as color permutations and geometric transformations), underscoring that TRM’s efficiency lies in its parameter size rather than total compute demand.The model’s simplicity and transparency make it more accessible to researchers outside of large corporate labs. Its codebase builds directly on the earlier Hierarchical Reasoning Model framework but removes HRM’s biological analogies, multiple network hierarchies, and fixed-point dependencies. In doing so, TRM offers a reproducible baseline for exploring recursive reasoning in small models — a counterpoint to the dominant “scale is all you need” philosophy.Community ReactionThe release of TRM and its open-source codebase prompted an immediate debate among AI researchers and practitioners on X. While many praised the achievement, others questioned how broadly its methods could generalize.Supporters hailed TRM as proof that small models can outperform giants, calling it “10,000× smaller yet smarter” and a potential step toward architectures that think rather than merely scale. Critics countered that TRM’s domain is narrow — focused on bounded, grid-based puzzles — and that its compute savings come mainly from size, not total runtime. Researcher Yunmin Cha noted that TRM’s training depends on heavy augmentation and recursive passes, “more compute, same model.” Cancer geneticist and data scientist Chey Loveday stressed that TRM is a solver, not a chat model or text generator: it excels at structured reasoning but not open-ended language.Machine learning researcher Sebastian Raschka positioned TRM as an important simplification of HRM rather than a new form of general intelligence. He described its process as “a two-step loop that updates an internal reasoning state, then refines the answer.”Several researchers, including Augustin Nabele, agreed that the model’s strength lies in its clear reasoning structure but noted that future work would need to show transfer to less-constrained problem types.The consensus emerging online is that TRM may be narrow, but its message is broad: careful recursion, not constant expansion, could drive the next wave of reasoning research.Looking AheadWhile TRM currently applies to supervised reasoning tasks, its recursive framework opens several future directions. Jolicoeur-Martineau has suggested exploring generative or multi-answer variants, where the model could produce multiple possible solutions rather than a single deterministic one. Another open question involves scaling laws for recursion — determining how far the “less is more” principle can extend as model complexity or data size grows.Ultimately, the study offers both a practical tool and a conceptual reminder: progress in AI need not depend on ever-larger models. Sometimes, teaching a small network to think carefully — and recursively — can be more powerful than making a large one think once.",

          "standfirst": "Everyone uses smartwatches differently. There are the people who wear them all day, those who only wear them when they’re outside, those who only use them while working out and even those who only wear them to bed. In 2025, most smartwatches can do it all and satisfy your needs regardless of how you use them. They perform a lot of basic activity and sleep tracking while serving as excellent passive data gatherers. Google’s latest, the Pixel Watch 4, stands strong against rivals like the Apple Watch Series 11 and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8, and if you look just at those model numbers, it’s impressive how far Google has come in just four generations. The Galaxy Watch 8 is probably the Pixel Watch 4’s closest competitor, considering they’re both compatible with Android while the Apple Watch only works with iPhones. Comparing them can feel a bit futile, since it’s most likely you’ll buy the watch that works best with your brand of phone (i.e. Pixel watch for a Pixel phone, Samsung for Samsung). But it’s still worthwhile to see how they fare against each other. If you know what a Samsung watch can do, it helps contextualize what should be considered acceptable on, say, your Pixel or Apple watch. It bodes well that for the Pixel Watch 4, I’m no longer questioning its fundamental functionality or complaining about its battery life. Rather, I found myself pondering its adaptability and consistency, as well as its strengths over the competition. Unsurprisingly, thanks to its Google and Fitbit heritage, those strengths lie in AI and health tracking. But the Pixel Watch 4 has a surprising advantage that I never saw coming: charging speed. What’s new on the Pixel Watch 4 Before I get into that though, let’s quickly go over what’s changed on the Pixel Watch 4. It now has a curved display under its domed glass covering, which makes it look even livelier than before. It’s surrounded by bezels that Google says are 16 percent smaller than the last model’s, allowing its screen to be about 10 percent roomier. The display is also brighter by about 50 percent, now going up to 3,000 nits. That’s the same as Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8, but higher than the Apple Watch Series 11’s 2,000 nits of peak brightness. Altogether, the physical changes make Pixel Watch 4 look eye-catching and attractive, and I kept getting compliments from people outside my usual tech-savvy circles. Other hardware upgrades include the new dual-frequency GPS, custom haptics engine and speaker, as well as updated processors and a revamped, faster charging system that places the contact points on the watch’s edge instead of the back. Importantly, though I didn’t test it for this review, the Pixel Watch 4 is more repairable, since you can unscrew its case to replace its display and battery if needed. Like many non-Apple smartwatches, the Pixel Watch 4 runs Google’s Wear OS, but with some new features like a wrist-raise gesture to trigger the Gemini assistant. The company also improved its algorithms for activity- and sleep-tracking, brought its Material 3 Expressive design languages and new watch faces to the OS and overhauled the Fitbit app to center around an AI coach. However, the redesigned Fitbit app wasn’t available for testing during this review, so you won’t see any evaluations of it here. One more thing I didn’t try on the Pixel Watch 4: Emergency SOS via Satellite. Google’s smartwatch was the first mainstream wearable to be announced to have satellite communications built in, though Apple released the Watch Ultra 3 with similar capabilities shortly after. Because the setup would result in a call or message being sent to emergency services, I decided against testing the satellite feature for this review. If you’re new to smartwatches or considering your first one, check out our smartwatch buying guide for details on what to expect of a device in 2025. By and large, though, this review won’t cover the basics of what a smartwatch does and what apps or features are typically available. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Fast-charging is so good that I no longer worry I never thought I’d be such a fan of short charge times, but Google’s latest wearable is so fast at refueling that I’ve actually changed my behavior around it. I typically place my smartwatch (usually just the most recent Apple Watch I’ve tested) on my kitchen island so that I see it when I grab my pre-bedtime cup of water and remember to put it on the charger overnight. With the Pixel Watch 4, I’ve started to just drop it on the charger when I wake up, and by the time I’m done brushing my teeth, washing my face and changing into my gym clothes, it’ll have plenty of power for about half a day. I can’t say the same for the Apple Watch, though the Series 11 has respectable charging speeds that allow me to get enough for a morning walk and a workout after about 10 minutes of being plugged in. For the actual numbers, you can read my colleague Sam Rutherford’s story where he meticulously charted the charge time of the larger 45mm model of the Pixel Watch 4 he’s been using. It jives with my experience, where, after just six minutes, my device went from 37 percent to 62 percent. I was also impressed when I saw an alert on the watch’s face that told me the charger wasn’t actually plugged into an outlet. I’ve been burned in the past when I placed other smartwatches on their charging pucks, only to come back an hour later and realize it hadn’t actually been charging because I didn’t connect the cable to a socket. This feature felt like a particularly thoughtful touch on Google’s part. The Pixel Watch 4’s battery life With such quick recharging, it can feel like a long-lasting battery isn’t as important. But the Pixel Watch 4 still manages to deliver respectable runtimes. In general, I preferred to let the Pixel Watch 4 get a full charge, because I noticed its battery doesn’t get me through a whole day after just a few minutes on the dock. But when I took it off the charger at 3:35PM one Friday afternoon, it managed to last all through Saturday night, going from 100 percent to 22 percent by 9PM the next day. That’s after a full day of passive activity tracking, where the watch noted that I had burned about 3,000 calories, hiked 6.73 miles and climbed the equivalent of 128 floors. The Pixel Watch 4 typically lasts about as long as the Apple Watch Series 11. Both devices clock about a day and a half, depending on how frequently I use features like Gemini or the remote control view for the phone’s camera. That runtime also seems similar to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, which my colleague Amy Skorheim reviewed. Considering Google rates the 41mm version of the Watch 4 to last about 30 hours on a charge, the experience I had mostly surpasses that estimate. Of course, battery performance usually deteriorates over time, so my brand new review unit will likely get a little less long-lasting after a while. Fitbit / Engadget Sleep tracking: A tale of insomnia and naps I wouldn’t usually dwell on a feature that has been around for generations of a device, but Google did update its sleep-tracking algorithms for the Pixel Watch 4, calling it “our most accurate sleep-tracking.” Plus, as Apple only just introduced Sleep Score on the Series 11, I thought it was a good opportunity to compare the two. Both companies thoughtfully limit the brightness of their watches’ displays when you’re in bed, and tuned their software in response to your usual bedtimes so you won’t be awoken by endless notifications while sleeping. They all deliver sleep scores and readouts of the zones you cycled through while you rested, too, to help you get better insight on your slumber. While I prefer Apple’s presentation of the sleep score in a ring with three segments to indicate areas of potential improvement, I find Google’s charts more readable and specific data easier to find. I’m not going to spend too much time complaining about an app’s layout, though, since it largely has to do with getting used to the way a company organizes its info. What’s more important is how their devices count your sleep, and whether they do so accurately. In anticipation of a long day that would start at about 4:45AM, I went to bed at about 10PM, only to wake up at 1:57AM, unable to fall back asleep. I counted sheep, told myself to fall asleep, got angry at myself for not being able to sleep and peeked at my phone, which showed me that it had been an hour since I woke up. I finally drifted off after some time, waking up when the Pixel Watch 4 dragged me out of a dream by buzzing relentlessly on my wrist. In my half-awake state, I actually thought the vibration was part of the dream and almost went back to sleep, until I remembered it was the silent alarm I had set for 4:45AM. Color me shocked when I saw my sleep score was 81 — deemed “Good” by the Pixel Watch 4 due in part to my accumulating six hours and 24 minutes of rest. I immediately dug into the sleep chart to see if my hour awake had been misattributed to sleep. It had been. The device did pick up many moments of restlessness, saying that movement was detected during 9 percent of my sleep. But it couldn’t tell that despite my lying fairly still, I had been, sadly, wide awake. I can’t penalize Google or Fitbit too heavily for that. Most sleep trackers can’t tell between periods of sleep and complete stillness either. Google said lying awake but very still in bed before you sleep can sometimes be tracked as sleep, and that it’s a known limitation of the algorithm that it’s working on improving for future iterations. Another area for improvement: napping. On the way home to New York from Lake Placid, I passed out for about an hour at 9PM. Since that was late enough to count as bedtime for some people, I hoped that the Apple Watch and Pixel Watch would both take those minutes into consideration. But neither did. With the Pixel Watch 4, I found out later that naps during the day would be counted, they just had to last at least two hours. Two-hour naps? In this economy?? I don’t know who else has the time but a quick hourlong lie-down is big for me. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch was reported to be able to track naps in a watchOS 11 beta, but I’m still waiting on official word and details about that. Like I said at the start of this review, sleep-tracking isn’t a major reason I use smartwatches. For those, like Sam, who do, the Pixel Watch 4 will be quite satisfying. Sam noted that the device was mostly accurate in his experience, and detected when he had to get up to feed his baby at night. Plus, it’s light and comfortable enough to wear to bed (when paired with the right strap), and its battery will last all night. Add the fast charging we’ve already raved about and it seems like there’s almost no reason to not have the Pixel Watch 4 on your wrist at all times. A word on alarms, timers and stopwatches I also like that on the Pixel Watch, I was able to set an alarm to wake me with just vibration and no sound, so I could get up earlier than my partner before we left for our five-hour drive to Lake Placid. I could not find this on the Apple Watch — though I did have the option to allow the alarm to break through silent mode. It’s just another way the two companies differ, and I imagine they’ll both copy each other and add the respective missing features soon enough. Google / Apple / Engadget One thing I do wish Apple would change: the icons for the Stopwatch, Timer and Alarm apps on watchOS. All three of them are represented by orange circles in the app drawer, with slightly different versions of circles with clock hands in them. They’re not labeled, either, so if you’re not in the List view you’ll have to guess which of these three orange orbs is the time-related app you want, and go back and forth until you find the right one. Google is only slightly better at this, since it uses an hourglass to represent the Timer and the Alarm and Stopwatch icons are a bit more distinct from each other. Plus, Alarm sits at the top of the Pixel Watch’s drawer, whereas the Stopwatch and Timer are closer together near the bottom. They’re clearly organized alphabetically, since other options near the top are Contacts, Calendar and Camera while Recorder, Settings and Spotify are at the end with Stopwatch and Timer. Meanwhile, all of Apple’s first-party apps are at the top of the watchOS app drawer and if you throw in the other orange circle that is the World Clock, you’ll have four cheesy orbs sitting in close proximity to each other like Ritz crackers. Gestures and Gemini — convenience with some caveats Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 was the first smartwatch to have Google’s Gemini onboard, but when the Pixel Watch 4 launched, it brought the “raise to talk to Gemini” feature with it. This allows for convenient hands-free communication with the AI, so long as you have an internet connection, anyway. When I left my Pixel 10 Pro in a locker and went for a quick riverside walk, I wasn’t able to get the assistant to set a timer so I knew when to start heading back. This isn’t just about the wrist-raising gesture — Gemini simply won’t work on the Pixel Watch 4 if it’s not online, whether that be via a tethered phone or its own cellular connection. In contrast, while I did have to long-press the Apple Watch’s knob or say “Hey Siri,” I was at least able to get it to set that alarm, even when I put it (and the iPhone it was linked to) on Airplane mode. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s frustrating if you don’t have an LTE version of the watch and decide to leave your phone at home. Sure, you can touch the screen and use the app to set that timer, but I don’t want to have to stop, lift up my wrist and select the number of minutes my countdown should run. Cherlynn Low for Engadget There are a few caveats to note when specifically talking about the wrist-raise gestures, too. For one, you’ll have to make sure the Always On Display is enabled, since the system relies on the screen being on to detect changes in movement and state. You’ll also have to be fairly deliberate with the gesture, bringing your wrist to your mouth from about waist-level. For the most part the Pixel Watch 4 responded as expected, with the onscreen indicator telling me Gemini was listening when I brought my hand to my mouth. But every now and then, especially when I was sitting down, it would fail to react. There are few situations more embarrassing than sitting in a cafe, repeatedly jerking your wrist up to your face while holding a phone up to get a video of the feature working. I could only hope the other people at the coffee shop where I was writing this review didn’t think I was doing something worse. Sometimes, the little glowing animation would appear to show that my action was successful, but if I even moved my wrist slightly after that, it would disappear. Also, if you lift your wrist from any screen other than the home page, you won’t see the indicator. But if you confidently speak your request into the ether anyway, you’ll realize Gemini was actually awoken by your gesture. With the apps drawer open, I lifted my wrist and asked what the weather was like, and promptly got a response. There was also a light vibration to let me know the watch had heard me. When I raised my hand again and asked “how about tomorrow,” Gemini was quick to tell me it would be rainy in my area. I was impressed by the speedy responses and the fact that I could keep bringing my hand up to my mouth to ask follow-up questions or interrupt an overly wordy response, but I do have to acknowledge that there is a certain finesse that is required to get the gesture right each time. I was a little perturbed that the action needs to be somewhat deliberate, right up until the one time it accidentally triggered when I flipped my wrist during a call. Out of nowhere, the assistant was responding to my conversation with my therapist. This only happened once during my 10 or so days with the Pixel Watch 4, so the rate of false positives is fairly low. The jerkiness of raise-to-talk to Gemini is a tradeoff I’m willing to make in exchange for fewer accidental triggers. Plus, Google has said this is an initial foray into gesture-based interaction with the Pixel Watch, and it appears to continue to tweak its algorithms for greater accuracy and sensitivity. The Watch 4 may not currently support the double tap and wrist flick gestures that Apple does (or Samsung’s pinch-based actions). But I’ve been in the industry long enough to remember when Android Wear watches allowed you to flip your wrist to scroll through long notifications. It seems Wear OS still supports that, along with a limited set of gesture-based navigation actions. I was able to dismiss notifications and return to the home page by rotating my wrist on the Pixel Watch 4 thanks to the existing “ungaze” gesture that’s designed to close an alerting notification. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Auto workout detection is different, but still here Over the years, Google has gone back and forth on its auto-workout-detection system. With the original Pixel Watch, the device didn’t bother to tell you if it noticed you had gone on a walk. You’d have to go into the Fitbit app a few hours later to see that session. That changed with the Pixel Watch 2, which brought reminders to start a workout for seven types of activities including running, walking, rowing and outdoor biking. The Watch 3 improved upon that by being quick on the uptake, suggesting I had been active as soon as I had been moving for 10 minutes. On the Watch 4, Google changed its approach (again). At first, it no longer appeared to automatically track my daily 20-minute walks to and from my gym. But because I remembered my experience with the original model, I went to the Fitbit app on my phone and was relieved to see a suggested workout logged there. Subsequently, I discovered that the Watch 4 would prompt me to confirm detected periods of activity, but only 30 minutes after I was done. The idea is that the prompt to record a walk or impromptu run might interrupt your flow, and while I can understand that rationale, I wish there was an option for me to just set it how I prefer it. The good news is that in my time with the Pixel Watch 4, I never felt shortchanged. As long as they lasted at least 15 minutes, pretty much all my extended walks were accurately logged (minus the location information, which makes sense from a privacy perspective). I also wore a Galaxy Ring during my review, since in my experience that’s the most accurate at tracking every little walk I take, and the two devices usually matched up. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, barely ever registered any of my walks, and I always needed to remember to manually start an Outdoor Walk workout. With its new dual-frequency GPS, the Pixel Watch 4 is better at mapping out my routes than its predecessors, especially in building-dense cities like the one I live in. I never noticed a significant delay in the watch latching onto a signal, even as I walked out of a small tunnel into the skyscraper-rich Newport area of New Jersey. Fitbit / Engadget Stress-detection, messaging and more Each of this year’s new smartwatches has some unique features. Samsung has its antioxidant index test, Apple has hypertension notifications and Google has had loss of pulse detection and body response alerts. That latter basically notices changes in your electrodermal activity and prompts you to note if you’re feeling particularly stressed or excited. It’s been around since the Pixel Watch 2, and isn’t enabled on the fourth-generation device by default so you won’t have to worry about it pinging you too much. I had it activated and was buzzed several times most days to think about my mood, and each evening I’d have a nice log of how many times I was agitated. There are quite a few new features on the Pixel Watch 4 that I won’t spend too much time evaluating. The real-time streaming of your bike workout stats to your connected phone is one example. Like Apple’s version of this feature, it works and makes it easy to see your stats safely on a mounted handset during your ride. Google also introduced something called “notification cooldown” which minimizes interruptions after several of them come through in rapid succession. If your group chat is getting particularly fiery, for example, this can help reduce the amount of vibrations and alerts being sent to your wrist after some time. I made my friend Julian Chokkattu at Wired test this out with me and we sent each other single-word messages nonstop for minutes at a time and both of us found notification cooldown kicked in after a few alerts. Speaking of, the Pixel Watch 4 also features AI-generated suggested replies to messages that support the Wear OS quick reply protocol. Google said this is a first-of-its-kind small language model designed for use on a watch. Because it’s on-device, it won’t require an internet connection to work, though if you’re receiving messages I have to imagine you’re at least connected to cellular. When it did work, it was nice to see the smart reply suggestions instead of the generic canned ones before. But most of the apps I use, like Telegram and Instagram messages, don’t support quick reply. Google also says smart replies won’t work on Workspace or select WhatsApp messaging. The interface you’re most likely to interact with on any smartwatch is your main watch face, and in general the new watch faces on the Pixel Watch 4 are rich with information and shortcuts. While I wish Google would move away from the cartoonish, rounded fonts in favor of something cleaner and sharper, I like that all its layouts offer plenty of customization options with lots of room for convenient complications. I chose to put my most important stats on my home screen, as well as a shortcut to launch Spotify. I do wish Google would make nicer faces like Apple’s Photos one that has a dynamic clock to better highlight your pictures, instead of the current option on the Pixel Watch that sticks the text in the bottom and calls it a day. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Wrap-up When I reviewed the Pixel Watch 3, it felt like the first time Google’s smartwatch was on par with the likes of Apple’s and Samsung’s offerings. With the Pixel Watch 4, not only is Google closing the gap even further than it did last year, but it’s also bringing unique tools you won’t find elsewhere. This year’s model differentiates itself with a repairable design, super fast charging and, though it’s no longer the only one on the market to offer this, satellite communications. The first two alone feel like game changers, and even with its limitations, raising your wrist to talk to Gemini is a convenient gesture when it works. Beyond the new features sit the comprehensive suite of health-related tools that make the Pixel Watch 4 a formidable smartwatch and excellent companion for your smartphone. Wear OS and Material 3 Expressive make for a vibrant, easy-to-navigate interface for a system that can do almost anything your phone can, just on a smaller screen. At $350, the Pixel Watch 4 is $20 more than the Galaxy Watch 8 (and $50 less than the Apple Watch Series 11). It’s hard to justify that exact price difference and tell you which is a worthier purchase. My recommendation remains the same as ever: Get the watch that’s from the same company as your phone. It’ll be better for you.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-review-a-well-rounded-smartwatch-with-a-surprising-advantage-170059851.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Everyone uses smartwatches differently. There are the people who wear them all day, those who only wear them when they’re outside, those who only use them while working out and even those who only wear them to bed. In 2025, most smartwatches can do it all and satisfy your needs regardless of how you use them. They perform a lot of basic activity and sleep tracking while serving as excellent passive data gatherers. Google’s latest, the Pixel Watch 4, stands strong against rivals like the Apple Watch Series 11 and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8, and if you look just at those model numbers, it’s impressive how far Google has come in just four generations. The Galaxy Watch 8 is probably the Pixel Watch 4’s closest competitor, considering they’re both compatible with Android while the Apple Watch only works with iPhones.

Google is only slightly better at this, since it uses an hourglass to represent the Timer and the Alarm and Stopwatch icons are a bit more distinct from each other. Plus, Alarm sits at the top of the Pixel Watch’s drawer, whereas the Stopwatch and Timer are closer together near the bottom. They’re clearly organized alphabetically, since other options near the top are Contacts, Calendar and Camera while Recorder, Settings and Spotify are at the end with Stopwatch and Timer. Meanwhile, all of Apple’s first-party apps are at the top of the watchOS app drawer and if you throw in the other orange circle that is the World Clock, you’ll have four cheesy orbs sitting in close proximity to each other like Ritz crackers. Gestures and Gemini — convenience with some caveats Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 was the first smartwatch to have Google’s Gemini onboard, but when the Pixel Watch 4 launched, it brought the “raise to talk to Gemini” feature with it. This allows for convenient hands-free communication with the AI, so long as you have an internet connection, anyway. When I left my Pixel 10 Pro in a locker and went for a quick riverside walk, I wasn’t able to get the assistant to set a timer so I knew when to start heading back. This isn’t just about the wrist-raising gesture — Gemini simply won’t work on the Pixel Watch 4 if it’s not online, whether that be via a tethered phone or its own cellular connection. In contrast, while I did have to long-press the Apple Watch’s knob or say “Hey Siri,” I was at least able to get it to set that alarm, even when I put it (and the iPhone it was linked to) on Airplane mode. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s frustrating if you don’t have an LTE version of the watch and decide to leave your phone at home. Sure, you can touch the screen and use the app to set that timer, but I don’t want to have to stop, lift up my wrist and select the number of minutes my countdown should run. Cherlynn Low for Engadget There are a few caveats to note when specifically talking about the wrist-raise gestures, too. For one, you’ll have to make sure the Always On Display is enabled, since the system relies on the screen being on to detect changes in movement and state. You’ll also have to be fairly deliberate with the gesture, bringing your wrist to your mouth from about waist-level. For the most part the Pixel Watch 4 responded as expected, with the onscreen indicator telling me Gemini was listening when I brought my hand to my mouth. But every now and then, especially when I was sitting down, it would fail to react. There are few situations more embarrassing than sitting in a cafe, repeatedly jerking your wrist up to your face while holding a phone up to get a video of the feature working. I could only hope the other people at the coffee shop where I was writing this review didn’t think I was doing something worse. Sometimes, the little glowing animation would appear to show that my action was successful, but if I even moved my wrist slightly after that, it would disappear. Also, if you lift your wrist from any screen other than the home page, you won’t see the indicator. But if you confidently speak your request into the ether anyway, you’ll realize Gemini was actually awoken by your gesture. With the apps drawer open, I lifted my wrist and asked what the weather was like, and promptly got a response. There was also a light vibration to let me know the watch had heard me. When I raised my hand again and asked “how about tomorrow,” Gemini was quick to tell me it would be rainy in my area. I was impressed by the speedy responses and the fact that I could keep bringing my hand up to my mouth to ask follow-up questions or interrupt an overly wordy response, but I do have to acknowledge that there is a certain finesse that is required to get the gesture right each time. I was a little perturbed that the action needs to be somewhat deliberate, right up until the one time it accidentally triggered when I flipped my wrist during a call. Out of nowhere, the assistant was responding to my conversation with my therapist. This only happened once during my 10 or so days with the Pixel Watch 4, so the rate of false positives is fairly low. The jerkiness of raise-to-talk to Gemini is a tradeoff I’m willing to make in exchange for fewer accidental triggers. Plus, Google has said this is an initial foray into gesture-based interaction with the Pixel Watch, and it appears to continue to tweak its algorithms for greater accuracy and sensitivity. The Watch 4 may not currently support the double tap and wrist flick gestures that Apple does (or Samsung’s pinch-based actions). But I’ve been in the industry long enough to remember when Android Wear watches allowed you to flip your wrist to scroll through long notifications. It seems Wear OS still supports that, along with a limited set of gesture-based navigation actions. I was able to dismiss notifications and return to the home page by rotating my wrist on the Pixel Watch 4 thanks to the existing “ungaze” gesture that’s designed to close an alerting notification. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Auto workout detection is different, but still here Over the years, Google has gone back and forth on its auto-workout-detection system. With the original Pixel Watch, the device didn’t bother to tell you if it noticed you had gone on a walk. You’d have to go into the Fitbit app a few hours later to see that session. That changed with the Pixel Watch 2, which brought reminders to start a workout for seven types of activities including running, walking, rowing and outdoor biking. The Watch 3 improved upon that by being quick on the uptake, suggesting I had been active as soon as I had been moving for 10 minutes. On the Watch 4, Google changed its approach (again). At first, it no longer appeared to automatically track my daily 20-minute walks to and from my gym. But because I remembered my experience with the original model, I went to the Fitbit app on my phone and was relieved to see a suggested workout logged there. Subsequently, I discovered that the Watch 4 would prompt me to confirm detected periods of activity, but only 30 minutes after I was done. The idea is that the prompt to record a walk or impromptu run might interrupt your flow, and while I can understand that rationale, I wish there was an option for me to just set it how I prefer it. The good news is that in my time with the Pixel Watch 4, I never felt shortchanged. As long as they lasted at least 15 minutes, pretty much all my extended walks were accurately logged (minus the location information, which makes sense from a privacy perspective). I also wore a Galaxy Ring during my review, since in my experience that’s the most accurate at tracking every little walk I take, and the two devices usually matched up. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, barely ever registered any of my walks, and I always needed to remember to manually start an Outdoor Walk workout. With its new dual-frequency GPS, the Pixel Watch 4 is better at mapping out my routes than its predecessors, especially in building-dense cities like the one I live in. I never noticed a significant delay in the watch latching onto a signal, even as I walked out of a small tunnel into the skyscraper-rich Newport area of New Jersey. Fitbit / Engadget Stress-detection, messaging and more Each of this year’s new smartwatches has some unique features. Samsung has its antioxidant index test, Apple has hypertension notifications and Google has had loss of pulse detection and body response alerts. That latter basically notices changes in your electrodermal activity and prompts you to note if you’re feeling particularly stressed or excited. It’s been around since the Pixel Watch 2, and isn’t enabled on the fourth-generation device by default so you won’t have to worry about it pinging you too much. I had it activated and was buzzed several times most days to think about my mood, and each evening I’d have a nice log of how many times I was agitated. There are quite a few new features on the Pixel Watch 4 that I won’t spend too much time evaluating. The real-time streaming of your bike workout stats to your connected phone is one example. Like Apple’s version of this feature, it works and makes it easy to see your stats safely on a mounted handset during your ride. Google also introduced something called “notification cooldown” which minimizes interruptions after several of them come through in rapid succession. If your group chat is getting particularly fiery, for example, this can help reduce the amount of vibrations and alerts being sent to your wrist after some time. I made my friend Julian Chokkattu at Wired test this out with me and we sent each other single-word messages nonstop for minutes at a time and both of us found notification cooldown kicked in after a few alerts. Speaking of, the Pixel Watch 4 also features AI-generated suggested replies to messages that support the Wear OS quick reply protocol. Google said this is a first-of-its-kind small language model designed for use on a watch. Because it’s on-device, it won’t require an internet connection to work, though if you’re receiving messages I have to imagine you’re at least connected to cellular. When it did work, it was nice to see the smart reply suggestions instead of the generic canned ones before. But most of the apps I use, like Telegram and Instagram messages, don’t support quick reply. Google also says smart replies won’t work on Workspace or select WhatsApp messaging. The interface you’re most likely to interact with on any smartwatch is your main watch face, and in general the new watch faces on the Pixel Watch 4 are rich with information and shortcuts. While I wish Google would move away from the cartoonish, rounded fonts in favor of something cleaner and sharper, I like that all its layouts offer plenty of customization options with lots of room for convenient complications. I chose to put my most important stats on my home screen, as well as a shortcut to launch Spotify. I do wish Google would make nicer faces like Apple’s Photos one that has a dynamic clock to better highlight your pictures, instead of the current option on the Pixel Watch that sticks the text in the bottom and calls it a day. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Wrap-up When I reviewed the Pixel Watch 3, it felt like the first time Google’s smartwatch was on par with the likes of Apple’s and Samsung’s offerings. With the Pixel Watch 4, not only is Google closing the gap even further than it did last year, but it’s also bringing unique tools you won’t find elsewhere. This year’s model differentiates itself with a repairable design, super fast charging and, though it’s no longer the only one on the market to offer this, satellite communications. The first two alone feel like game changers, and even with its limitations, raising your wrist to talk to Gemini is a convenient gesture when it works. Beyond the new features sit the comprehensive suite of health-related tools that make the Pixel Watch 4 a formidable smartwatch and excellent companion for your smartphone. Wear OS and Material 3 Expressive make for a vibrant, easy-to-navigate interface for a system that can do almost anything your phone can, just on a smaller screen. At $350, the Pixel Watch 4 is $20 more than the Galaxy Watch 8 (and $50 less than the Apple Watch Series 11). It’s hard to justify that exact price difference and tell you which is a worthier purchase. My recommendation remains the same as ever: Get the watch that’s from the same company as your phone. It’ll be better for you.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-review-a-well-rounded-smartwatch-with-a-surprising-advantage-170059851.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best thing about the Pixel Watch 4 is Google’s new charger",
          "standfirst": "The Pixel Watch 4 is arguably the best looking smartwatch on the market. When you consider that the biggest design changes on the new model are a curvier glass dome, a larger display and slimmer bezels, you could've said the same thing about its predecessor. And while the Pixel Watch 4 also features improved health and fitness tracking and a more lively UI, the best thing about Google’s latest wearable isn’t even the watch itself. On the Pixel Watch 4, the charger is by far the biggest upgrade. The original Pixel Watch came with a wireless charging puck, which was super convenient and easy to use. I also appreciated that even though it didn't officially support the Qi wireless standard, you could reverse charge it with your phone just as long as you positioned it just right. That meant for short trips like a weekend getaway, you could simply leave the charger at home and travel super light while relying on your phone to pull double duty. The issue was that even in ideal conditions, the watch charged slowly, and when combined with lackluster battery life, you often ended up with a device that ran out of juice at inopportune times. This is the little devil that made charging the Pixel Watch 2 and 3 more annoying than it should have been.Sam Rutherford for Engadget For the Pixel Watch 2, Google sought to address this by switching to a charging cradle with pins that offered a higher power output. This is where my frustrations began. Because the pins on the charger needed to be aligned precisely, you could only mount the watch one way (i.e., the crown had to point the same direction as the charger’s wire). This might not sound like a big deal, but it made keeping the watch topped off harder than it should have been and often felt just as finicky as the \"unsupported\" phone-based reverse wireless charging available on its predecessor. The really annoying part is that the connection between the watch and the charger was so particular that I lost count of the number of times I thought I connected the watch to the puck before going about my normal morning routine, only to come back 45 minutes later to a still dead wristpiece. So not only did Google trade convenience for marginally faster charging (which still wasn't speedy enough imo), the company made the whole process more unreliable. And much to my dismay, the Pixel Watch 3 used the same charger as the Watch 2. Not only is the Pixel Watch 4's charging cradle much easier to use, it's design means there's no confusion about how to properly position the watch. Sam Rutherford for Engadget But on the Pixel Watch 4, Google provides a new cradle that makes almost everything so much better. Instead of charging pins, there are just two little contacts that touch the side of the watch. The added benefit of this is that now the screen is positioned vertically instead of lying flat on the table, which allows the watch’s display to also double as a little clock while it's recharging. Cute and useful! Also, due to the charger’s design, there’s no confusion about which way you need to place the watch — there’s a dial in the way on the “wrong” side. No amount of fiddling will make the watch sit right if you place it incorrectly. I just wish the charger had a USB-C port instead of a captured cable, so if anything happens to the cord, you could simply swap in another instead of potentially having to replace the entire thing. Of course, the biggest benefit is significantly improved charging speeds. To best illustrate the difference, I took the Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 4, connected them to their respective chargers and recorded their battery percentage every 10 minutes for an hour. And just to make things as fair as possible, I used Google's new 67-watt dual-port fast charger as the power adapter for both. Compared to the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 charges nearly twice as fast and all you really need is 30 minutes to get two full days of use compared to over an hour for its predecessor. Sam Rutherford for Engadget After just 30 minutes, the Pixel Watch 4 was basically done as it hit 94 percent. At that point, the Pixel Watch 3 was way behind at 58 percent. In fact, I had to give the Pixel Watch 3 an extension, because even after an hour, it only had an 85 percent charge. It took an extra 20 minutes after that just to crack 90 percent. So not only does the Pixel Watch 4 power up faster, it has a much better charging curve that effectively cuts your daily recharging time in half. Google has finally turned the Pixel Watch's battery life into a non-issue, thanks to faster charging and improved longevity. I get two and a half days easily, even with its always-on display enabled. Though in a perfect world, I would love it if smartwatches only had to be charged once a week. Regardless, the process of keeping the Pixel Watch 4 running isn't a chore like it was for previous models. I can simply drop it on the cradle while I wrangle the kids and grab some caffeine after waking up, and I know that it'll be ready to go as soon as I am. Thanks to tweaks like a larger, curved glass screen with smaller bezels, I'd argue that the Pixel Watch 4 is the best looking smartwatch on sale today.Sam Rutherford for Engadget Admittedly, this isn't a groundbreaking development, and in some ways, I feel like Google should have figured this out a generation or two ago. But sometimes small upgrades can have a big impact, especially on a device that looks this good and now functions even better than before.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-best-thing-about-the-pixel-watch-4-is-googles-new-charger-170052942.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Google Pixel Buds 2a review: Affordable earbuds that are better with ANC",
          "standfirst": "The Pixel Buds Pro 2 have been the best earbuds for Pixel phone owners since they arrived last fall. With the Pixel Buds 2a ($129) though, there’s no longer a clear-cut buying decision. This more affordable model finally has active noise cancellation (ANC) as just one of its many updates. It makes sense, then, that the Pixel Buds 2a are more expensive than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds A-Series. Still, there are sacrifices to be made if you decide to save $60 by choosing them over the Pro 2. What’s new on the Pixel Buds 2a? The biggest upgrade on the Pixel Buds 2a is the addition of active noise cancellation. On the previous A-Series earbuds, Google opted to retain any ANC abilities for the pricier Pixel Buds Pro line. While the company continues to reserve its best ANC performance for that model, the Pixel Buds 2a will still deliver some level of relief. It’s nowhere near what the best noise canceling earbuds can muster, but in most circumstances, it’s better than nothing. Another major change is the updated design. Google decided to keep its earbud aesthetic consistent, so the 2a mirrors the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a tiny stature and the “twist-to-adjust stabilizer” instead of a “stabilizer arc.” The new version of the stabilizer is more of a hump than anything else, but it’s just enough to hold the earbuds in place. Overall, the combination of size and the stabilizer offer a comfortable fit, with balanced weight that never feels like you’re hauling something on the sides of your head. What’s good about the Pixel Buds 2a? In addition to the improved comfort, Google bolstered the sound quality on the Pixel Buds 2a as well. You still get spatial audio, albeit without head tracking, but these earbuds do well with non-immersive content too. Through a range of genres from metal to jazz, the 2a offered crisp, detailed sound while much of the competition in this price range struggles with clarity. Oftentimes a set of $130 earbuds will come off muffled, like in Turnstile’s “I CARE,” but the Pixel Buds 2a keep the kick drum punchy and the vocals clear. Bass performance is another area where midrange earbuds tend to struggle, but the 2a holds its own with respectable performance here. Throughout Deftones’ private music, it maintained the low-end growl of Stephen Carpenter’s 7- and 8-string guitars. The tuning wasn’t just relegated to handling Abe Cunningham’s bass drum. And it’s not just raucous genres either: there’s plenty of deep tone in Ruston Kelly’s acoustic guitar on Pale, through the Window. Another perk of the Pixel Buds 2a is their Hearing Wellness updates that help you maintain healthy listening habits. In the Pixel Buds app, you’ll see both current listening and exposure levels, as well as comparisons for the last 24 hours and seven days. You can also opt to receive volume level notifications so you’ll be aware when you exceed the exposure limit. The hearing health tools on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are more comprehensive, but it’s nice to see level tracking on a set of mid-range earbuds. It’s certainly better than nothing. Potential dealbreakers on the Pixel Buds 2a Billy Steele for Engadget Besides more robust ANC performance, there are several differences between the Pixel Buds 2a and the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Those are almost entirely the advanced features the pricier model offers, despite both sets having the same Tensor A1 chip. Of those, there are three major tools the 2a doesn’t have: Adaptive Audio, Loud Noise Protection and Conversation Detection. The first two are new additions to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in recent weeks, but they provide automatic adjustments that either maintain audio performance or assist with hearing health. You also won’t be able to use head gestures to answer calls or reply to texts like you can on the Pixel Buds Pro 2. And for Gemini users, the ability to converse with Google’s AI in noisy environments isn’t available on the 2a either. You can still talk to Gemini Live on these cheaper earbuds, but you’ll need to be mindful of ambient noise levels when doing so. Another key difference between the 2a and Pro 2 is related to battery and charging. The biggest issue here is the Pixel Buds 2a’s case doesn’t support wireless charging. Battery life on the Pro model is eight hours with ANC off or 12 hours with it on. On the 2a, that's seven hours and 10 hours respectively. During my tests with the Pixel Buds 2a, I easily got a full workday out of the earbuds with a mix of ANC and transparency mode. That’s what I’d consider “normal” use with the former setting for focus time and the latter for calls and keeping tabs on my mischievous cocker spaniel. While the Pixel Buds 2a are equipped with what Google calls “AI-powered Clear Calling,” they don’t have the same beamforming microphones and voice accelerometer as the Pro 2. As a result, voice performance suffers on the more affordable model. It’s perfectly fine for casual conversations and last-minute work chats, but you’ll want something better for situations when you’re recording audio or leading the discussion. Lastly, the Pixel Buds 2a don’t have onboard volume controls. This is the biggest dealbreaker for me. In the year 2025, it’s infuriating to have to reach for my phone or keyboard to adjust the volume of my music or podcasts (looking at you, AirPods 4). I understand Google had to sacrifice some features to sell the 2a for $129, but this is a basic one I really wish it had kept. Wrap-up You can certainly use the Pixel Buds 2a with an iPhone or Galaxy device, but like the Pixel Buds Pro, you’re going to get the best out of these if you have a Pixel phone. Like Google’s previous models, these were built to be a conduit to Gemini Live and you’ll sacrifice some of the main features if you use the 2a with a non-Pixel device. If you do have a Pixel handset, there’s a lot to like here, including punchy sound, a comfy fit and respectable battery life. The limited hearing health tools are still handy and the addition of ANC is a welcome change. The best Google has to offer on Pixel Buds is still exclusive to the Pro 2, but the 2a is a perfectly capable audio companion for most Pixel phone owners.

And it’s not just raucous genres either: there’s plenty of deep tone in Ruston Kelly’s acoustic guitar on Pale, through the Window. Another perk of the Pixel Buds 2a is their Hearing Wellness updates that help you maintain healthy listening habits. In the Pixel Buds app, you’ll see both current listening and exposure levels, as well as comparisons for the last 24 hours and seven days. You can also opt to receive volume level notifications so you’ll be aware when you exceed the exposure limit. The hearing health tools on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are more comprehensive, but it’s nice to see level tracking on a set of mid-range earbuds. It’s certainly better than nothing. Potential dealbreakers on the Pixel Buds 2a Billy Steele for Engadget Besides more robust ANC performance, there are several differences between the Pixel Buds 2a and the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Those are almost entirely the advanced features the pricier model offers, despite both sets having the same Tensor A1 chip. Of those, there are three major tools the 2a doesn’t have: Adaptive Audio, Loud Noise Protection and Conversation Detection. The first two are new additions to the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in recent weeks, but they provide automatic adjustments that either maintain audio performance or assist with hearing health. You also won’t be able to use head gestures to answer calls or reply to texts like you can on the Pixel Buds Pro 2. And for Gemini users, the ability to converse with Google’s AI in noisy environments isn’t available on the 2a either. You can still talk to Gemini Live on these cheaper earbuds, but you’ll need to be mindful of ambient noise levels when doing so. Another key difference between the 2a and Pro 2 is related to battery and charging. The biggest issue here is the Pixel Buds 2a’s case doesn’t support wireless charging. Battery life on the Pro model is eight hours with ANC off or 12 hours with it on. On the 2a, that's seven hours and 10 hours respectively. During my tests with the Pixel Buds 2a, I easily got a full workday out of the earbuds with a mix of ANC and transparency mode. That’s what I’d consider “normal” use with the former setting for focus time and the latter for calls and keeping tabs on my mischievous cocker spaniel. While the Pixel Buds 2a are equipped with what Google calls “AI-powered Clear Calling,” they don’t have the same beamforming microphones and voice accelerometer as the Pro 2. As a result, voice performance suffers on the more affordable model. It’s perfectly fine for casual conversations and last-minute work chats, but you’ll want something better for situations when you’re recording audio or leading the discussion. Lastly, the Pixel Buds 2a don’t have onboard volume controls. This is the biggest dealbreaker for me. In the year 2025, it’s infuriating to have to reach for my phone or keyboard to adjust the volume of my music or podcasts (looking at you, AirPods 4). I understand Google had to sacrifice some features to sell the 2a for $129, but this is a basic one I really wish it had kept. Wrap-up You can certainly use the Pixel Buds 2a with an iPhone or Galaxy device, but like the Pixel Buds Pro, you’re going to get the best out of these if you have a Pixel phone. Like Google’s previous models, these were built to be a conduit to Gemini Live and you’ll sacrifice some of the main features if you use the 2a with a non-Pixel device. If you do have a Pixel handset, there’s a lot to like here, including punchy sound, a comfy fit and respectable battery life. The limited hearing health tools are still handy and the addition of ANC is a welcome change. The best Google has to offer on Pixel Buds is still exclusive to the Pro 2, but the 2a is a perfectly capable audio companion for most Pixel phone owners.

          "title": "Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold review: The tankiest foldable",
          "standfirst": "Every good device builds upon the generation that came before it. In the seven years or so that foldable phones have been around, we've seen some incredible breakthroughs. For all its flaws, the original Galaxy Fold was a magical creation that proved there was merit to Samsung’s sci-fi aspirations. Then the Galaxy Z Fold 3 added water resistance to a foldable for the first time plus built-in stylus support. More recently, Google simplified flexible phone design with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, proving manufacturers didn't need to mess around with funky aspect ratios before Samsung achieved unprecedented levels of thinness with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 earlier this summer. However, there's one thing that has become a standard feature on standard high-end smartphones that hasn't been available on foldables until now: top-tier dust resistance. That changes now thanks to the IP68 rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Not only does this solve one of the biggest shortcomings of foldables overall, but it gives you additional protection against one of life's everyday foibles. So while Google's latest flexible phone isn't nearly as slim or sleek as the Z Fold 7, it is the best option for folks who prefer a tankier device. Design: A new level of durability While the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (P10PF from here on out) might look like a carbon copy of last year's phone, there are a handful of subtle changes throughout. Google shrunk its hinge and made it more durable. It also shaved down parts of its aluminum frame — specifically the border to the left of its outside screen. As for the displays themselves, they're even brighter than before at 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits) while the size of P10PF's exterior panel has increased slightly to 6.4 inches (0.1 inches larger) by reclaiming some space that used to be bezel. And I still love the P10PF's 8-inch main screen for watching movies and reading comics, even with the cutout for its interior selfie cam in the top right corner. That said, if the presence of a rounded corner encapsulated by a right angle messes with your OCD tendencies, Google still hasn't found a fix for that. The biggest shortcoming of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may be its thickness, because at 10.8mm compared to just 8.9mm for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it's significantly heavier and bulkier to carry around. Sam Rutherford for Engadget As for the P10PF’s IP68 rating, which denotes the phone's ability to withstand intrusion from dust and immersion in water, this upgrade might not sound like a huge deal. But as someone whose daily driver was a Pixel 9 Pro Fold last year, I was sure to toss it in a waterproof bag when I went to the beach. That's because even though I had no intentions of actually swimming with it, I wanted to make sure sand wouldn't find its way inside. The sound of dust, dirt or other particles grinding in a foldable's hinge is deeply unpleasant and should be avoided at all costs. And thanks to the addition of a proper IP rating, you don't need to treat the P10PF like the Bubble Boy every time you want to enjoy a day at the shore. After Google debuted an all-new design on last year's phone, it's probably a bit much to ask for a full revamp 12 months later. Sadly, this means its size and weight haven't changed much, with the P10PF coming in at 9.1 ounces (258 grams) and 10.8mm thick when closed. If this phone had come out back in the spring, that might not have been an issue. However, with the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and its wonderfully thin and light design (7.6 ounces and 8.9mm when closed), it's hard to go back once you've experienced a foldable phone that doesn't have any of that excess heft. While I appreciate the added durability and tankiness we're getting now, here's hoping Google can put all of this in a leaner chassis next fall. Lastly, while the rest of the Pixel 10 family is going full eSIM for this generation, I appreciate that the P10PF still comes with a physical SIM card tray. Performance and software: Fast but not great for gaming Don't mess with Teemo or else he will throw a mushroom at you. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Like its pro siblings, the P10PF comes with a Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. In everyday use, that's more than enough oomph to make everything feel swift and snappy. Meanwhile, the arrival of Google's Material 3 Expressive UI update makes the whole phone feel even more lively, which makes even simple things like flipping between apps or customizing your homescreen that much more enjoyable. However, in terms of graphics performance, Google's Tensor G5 still can't quite keep up with flagship silicon from Qualcomm and its Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. That's because the Pixel 10 Pro Fold just isn't the best choice for hardcore gaming despite improved loading speeds. Unfortunately, a number of our regular tests like Geekbench 6 aren't available (as we're reviewing the phone prior to its official release), which makes getting concrete numbers a bit tricky. When running those apps on the Pixel 10 Pro XL (which features the same chip and memory), the Tensor G5 produced a multi-core score of 6,091 on Geekbench's Compute test. That’s more than 30 percent lower than what we got from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (9,271). Sam Rutherford for Engadget I wouldn't necessarily mark this down as a dealbreaker, as the P10PF's less prodigious performance isn't something you'll notice all the time. But if you do a lot of mobile video editing or hardcore gaming, that does make Google's latest foldable harder to recommend compared to the Z Fold 7. On the bright side, Google has added some enhanced multitasking features, most notably a new split-screen UI that lets you choose exactly how big you want two apps to be when opened in split-screen mode. Furthermore, you can leave one app open in a tiny sliver on either side and tap to quickly switch between the two, sort of like the card-based UI OnePlus created for the Open. It's very handy and makes it easy to flip back and forth between things like emails and messages or your calendar, though I really wish Google would give us the ability to permanently pin the P10PF's taskbar to the bottom of the screen like you can on Samsung's handset. The new UI for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's camera app makes much better use of the phone's big flexible screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Elsewhere, there's a new layout in the camera app that better utilizes the phone's main screen by putting the camera's viewfinder on the right while your photo roll appears on the left. This gives you an instant, big-picture view of every photo as soon as you take it without stopping you from setting up for the next shot. And for people who need extra help getting a good reaction from kids while posing for a shot, Google has also added some fresh animations to its Made You Look feature. Cameras: Still the best among foldables The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has the same rear cameras as its predecessor: a 48MP main cam, a 10.5MP ultra-wide and a 10.8MP telephoto cam with a 5x optical zoom. Sam Rutherford for Engadget While the cameras on the P10PF are the same as the ones in its predecessor, it's still the best way to capture sharp, colorful and detailed pics with a foldable phone. During the day, the P10PF consistently captured more accurate hues and tones than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (which has a tendency to exaggerate rich colors). And in low light, Google's Night Sight mode remains unmatched. In a tricky shot of a money cat taken in very low light, the P10PF's photo was noticeably brighter and more detailed, while a pic of some spooky skeletons was sharper and featured richer colors. On top of that, the Z Fold 7 tops out with a 3x telephoto zoom, but the Pro Fold sports a 5x optical lens that gives you more reach for long-distance images. If that wasn't enough, Google also gave the P10PF the ability to edit images solely using your voice, which is not only a time saver but a fantastic option for anyone who doesn't want to fiddle around with toggles and sliders to enhance their photos. Sadly, the coolest new feature from the Pixel 10 Pro line — Pro Res Zoom — isn't available on the Pro Fold, so you have to settle for a max zoom range of 20x instead of 100x. Battery life: A bigger cell and PixelSnap Packing a 5,015mAh cell, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's battery is nearly 10 percent larger than last year's model, which resulted in notable gains on our local video rundown test. When using its exterior display, it lasted just over 27 hours (27:02), almost an hour longer than what we got from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (26:22). Naturally, the P10PF doesn't last nearly as long when using its larger interior display. However, with a time of 21:20, that still leaves a lot of room for activities. Even if you don't use it for charging, being able to slap magnetic accessories on the back of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is super useful. Sam Rutherford for Engadget When it comes to recharging, the Fold has gotten some upgrades there too. Wired speeds have risen slightly to 30 watts (up from 21 watts), while wireless rate has doubled to 15 watts. This comes thanks in large part to Google's newfound support of the Qi2 standard, which also brings compatibility for magnetic accessories. That means now you can use the kind of accessories iPhone owners have enjoyed for years (Google calls this feature PixelSnap on its phones) and alongside its new IP68 rating, this might be one of the biggest upgrades to the phone's general usability. Wrap-up The addition of proper dust and water resistance on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has removed one of the last two shortcomings of modern foldables, which is no mean feat. However, at $1,799, the price barrier is still hard to overcome for most folks. On top of that, when compared to its biggest rival, it'd be a mistake for anyone interested in big and expensive flexible phones to ignore the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Its super sleek design simply cannot be denied. Plus, higher performance, more freedom to open additional windowed apps and the option for a permanently pinned taskbar make Samsung's rival the preferred pick for gamers and power users. Sam Rutherford for Engadget When it comes to the category as a whole, the P10PF offers the best photo toolkit around. There’s also Google's excellent (and ever-growing) stable of handy AI-powered features and my preferred skin for Android 16. Factor in longer battery life, improved multitasking and true Qi2 wireless support for the first time on any foldable, and you have a recipe for a versatile and surprisingly rugged flexible phone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-the-tankiest-foldable-170051471.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It's not as flashy as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but Samsung Galaxy S25 still gets you a great smartphone experience, just in a more traditional package. If you want to see for yourself, during Prime Day, you can get a Samsung Galaxy S25 for $660, $200 off its normal price and close to the phone's lowest price to date. The Galaxy S25 is a mix of old and new. The phone largely looks like the Galaxy S24, but comes in new colors and a slightly thinner frame. It uses the same bright 6.2-inch, 120Hz AMOLED screen, but is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. You're stuck with the same 50-megapixel wide, 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP 3x telephoto, but the phone (sort of) supports Qi2, if you're willing to add on a case. The list goes on, but what matters, based on Engadget's review of the smartphone, is that battery life is long and Samsung seems to be delivering on the promise of smartphone AI features. In terms of battery life, the Galaxy S24 already started out strong at around 24 hours, but the Galaxy S25 goes a good bit past that with an additional four hours. That gives you more time for calls or watching videos — one of the tangible benefits of a power-efficient 3nm Qualcomm chip. That performance also shines when it comes with AI. Samsung offers its own collection of Galaxy AI features, like the less-than-useful Now Brief and AI photo editing, but it's also just a good vehicle for Gemini. Google debuted the ability for Gemini to take action across on-device apps and services on the Galaxy S25, and it works well. At $800, a Galaxy S25 that largely carries over the features and components of the S24 isn't necessarily appealing. But for $200 off for Prime Day, and a guaranteed 256GB of base storage, purchasing Samsung's cheapest Galaxy S25 starts to make a lot more sense.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-200-off-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-for-prime-day-100037363.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you're a creator in the market for a good-quality wireless microphone, DJI has not just one but two of its best products on sale for October Prime Day. The Mic Mini, which is already a good deal at the regular $169 price, is marked down to just $99 for a savings of 41 percent. And DJI's Mic 2, which offers features like 32-bit float recording and support for external microphones, is currently available for $269 or $80 off the regular price. DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case. The mics weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit, 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 Pro and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. With a range of 1300 feet and 48 hours of battery life with the charger case, they're an excellent addition to a creator's bag of tricks. DJI's wireless Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera via a 3.5mm cable, but also supports Bluetooth audio to easily pair with a smartphone as well. It can transmit at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. Sound quality is exceptional thanks to the 20 to 20K Hz frequency response and up to 32-bit float recording internally. And for professionals (and unlike the new Mic 3), you can connect external microphones from Shure, Sennheiser and others if you want. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/djis-popular-wireless-mic-mini-kit-is-discounted-to-99-for-prime-day-163220479.html?src=rss",

The deal is available for both the black and white colorways. We reviewed the Era 100 and came away impressed, saying that it provides \"affordable multi-room audio that actually sounds good.\" This model replaced the Sonos One speaker and it's an improvement on that design in every major way.

It includes built-in mics for Trueplay tuning and works with just about every music streaming service. It's a good little speaker. While it's easy to recommend this unit, there are a couple of little caveats. It doesn't offer voice support for Google Assistant, though it does integrate with Alexa and the company's proprietary voice assistant.

          "standfirst": "If you’re in the market for a new camera, drone or accessories, Amazon’s October Prime Day is proving to be a particularly good time to shop. You can find deals from major brands including DJI, Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and others. You’ll also see discounts on important accessories like memory cards, backpacks and tripods from the likes of LowePro and SanDisk. Many of these deals are on products that rarely go on sale, like DJI drones and Insta360 cameras, along with Canon, Nikon and Panasonic lenses. And you’ll see many products that appear in our most recent camera guide that are highly recommended by Engadget — so check that out as you add items to your cart. Now, dive in to see the best Prime Day camera deals you can find this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Polaroid Now 3rd-generation plus film for $136 (15 percent off): Polaroid is a name synonymous with instant cameras, and its Now model is the best choice for larger film. With this deal, you can grab one now with film for just $7 over the price of the camera without film. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. DJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. HoverAir X1 drone for $265 (34 percent off): The HoverAir X1 offers features like a folding, people-safe design, and up to 2.7K 30p HDR video. Unlike DJI’s Flip, it can dodge obstacles while tracking people, making it slightly better for that purpose. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $269 (21 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 5 Pro is a good alternative to GoPro's Hero 13 Black. It has a 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than its rival in low light and rivals it in battery life as well with over two hours while shooting in 4K 60p. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $359 (17 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. And if you want an even wider field of view, grab the Hero 13 Black Wide Edition for $329. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $720 (18 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $75 (16 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case. The mics weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. SmallRig Camera Tripod for $49 (30 percent off): This 2-in-1 tripod easily transforms into a monopod depending on your needs. It comes with a 360-degree detachable ball head, supports up to 33 pounds and lets you adjust the working height from 16- to 71-inches in seconds. Rode Wireless Micro for $99 (24 percent off): Another great wireless mic option is Rode's Wireless Micro designed for smartphone users. The receiver connects to the bottom of your smartphone via USB-C and the microphones attach to the subject via integrated clips or magnets. They capture pristine sound well above what your smartphone can do, with a 20-20 kHz frequency range and 73 dB signal-to-noise ratio. SanDisk 512GB Extreme Pro CFexpress Card Type B for $120 (24 percent off): If you need tons of storage for a newer camera with a CFexpress Type B slot, SanDisk's 512GB is a great deal. It can handle reading and writing at 1,700MB/s and 1,400MB/s respectively, enough speed for RAW video capture. Lowepro Flipside BP 300 AW III for $182 (24 percent off): The Flipside BP300 AW III is a rugged, lightweight bag that securely holds and protects your camera gear in the worst weather. It has rear access for protection and a special compartment to hold lenses. SmallRig AD-80 FreeBlazer video tripod for $175 (30 percent off): Weighing just 11.6 pounds, it supports up to a 17.6-pound load and expands from 34 to 75 inches with a one-step height adjustment. For smooth operation, it offers fluid head damping though 360-degree horizontal and +90°/-65° tilt. DJI Mic 2 for $269 (23 percent off): DJI's Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera like other mics, but also supports Bluetooth audio so can easily be connected to a smartphone as well. It picks up audio from your subject at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs. DJI RS 4 Mini $309 (16 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock. On top of that, the company introduced automatic tracking via its RS Intelligent Tracking Module to keep human subjects in frame no matter where they go. It also offers smoother gimbal tracking, longer battery life and faster charging. Lexar 128GB Professional 2000x SD Card $90 (31 percent off): If you need very fast SD UHS II memory, Lexar currently has an excellent deal on its 128GB 2000x memory card. It offers 300MB/s read and 260Mb/s write speeds, quick enough to capture high data rate video or bursts of high-resolution photos. Amazon is also offering a solid discount on 256GB memory in the same lineup at $170 or 23 percent off. Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $248 (17 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out. It offers beautiful bokeh and fast speeds in low light, but costs nearly half the price of f/1.4 models. Nikon Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 Lens $497 (17 percent off): If you want a fast 50mm portrait lens but don't have a ton to spend, Nikon's Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 lens is on sale for just $497, making it one of the cheapest full-frame options available. At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal. The Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 lens is fast and sharp with painterly bokeh thanks to the 9-blade iris design. It's great for video as well, with the silent STM mechanism offering silent autofocus and suppressed focus breathing. Canon RF24-70mm F2.8 L lens $2,399 (8 percent off): If you've been eyeballing a fast Canon RF mount zoom, now's the time to act. The RF24-70mm f/2.8 L lens rarely goes on sale, but is now available with a $200 (8 percent) discount. It offers an f/2.8 aperture across the entire zoom range so you get awesome bokeh for portraits and high versatility in low light situations.

DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $720 (18 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $75 (16 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case.

For smooth operation, it offers fluid head damping though 360-degree horizontal and +90°/-65° tilt. DJI Mic 2 for $269 (23 percent off): DJI's Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera like other mics, but also supports Bluetooth audio so can easily be connected to a smartphone as well. It picks up audio from your subject at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs. DJI RS 4 Mini $309 (16 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock. On top of that, the company introduced automatic tracking via its RS Intelligent Tracking Module to keep human subjects in frame no matter where they go. It also offers smoother gimbal tracking, longer battery life and faster charging. Lexar 128GB Professional 2000x SD Card $90 (31 percent off): If you need very fast SD UHS II memory, Lexar currently has an excellent deal on its 128GB 2000x memory card. It offers 300MB/s read and 260Mb/s write speeds, quick enough to capture high data rate video or bursts of high-resolution photos. Amazon is also offering a solid discount on 256GB memory in the same lineup at $170 or 23 percent off. Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $248 (17 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out. It offers beautiful bokeh and fast speeds in low light, but costs nearly half the price of f/1.4 models. Nikon Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 Lens $497 (17 percent off): If you want a fast 50mm portrait lens but don't have a ton to spend, Nikon's Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 lens is on sale for just $497, making it one of the cheapest full-frame options available. At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal. The Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 lens is fast and sharp with painterly bokeh thanks to the 9-blade iris design. It's great for video as well, with the silent STM mechanism offering silent autofocus and suppressed focus breathing. Canon RF24-70mm F2.8 L lens $2,399 (8 percent off): If you've been eyeballing a fast Canon RF mount zoom, now's the time to act. The RF24-70mm f/2.8 L lens rarely goes on sale, but is now available with a $200 (8 percent) discount.

Accepting that, you might as well own a good pair of earbuds, and if you're on Android, Google's wireless earbuds are one of your best options. You can purchase a pair of Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 for $170 for Prime Day, $60 less than its normal $230 price. That's a pretty great deal for a pair of wireless earbuds that rival Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are compact wireless earbuds with a touch-sensitive surface and a small circular ring in the back to help them stay in your ears. You can currently purchase the buds in bluish-gray \"Moonstone,\" off-white \"Porcelain,\" pink \"Peony\" or light black \"Hazel\" color options, but whichever you choose, you'll get solid active noise cancellation and a collection of other helpful audio features. In terms of ANC, Engadget's review of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 found that the earbuds do a good job of blocking out \"low-to-mid-range noise\" but still struggle to block out nearby voices. On the whole, though, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 sounds better than Google's previous wireless earbuds, particularly when you're listening bass-forward tracks. The capabilities of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 extend beyond just listening to music, of course. Like its competitors, Google has turned its wireless earbuds into hearing protection, too. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 were recently updated to support what Google calls Loud Noise Protection, which can reduce incoming loud noises to protect your ears. That's on top of features like Adaptive Audio, which can adjust noise cancellation and volume based on your surroundings, and Talk to Gemini Live, which gives you a hands-free way to have a free-flowing conversation with Google's AI chatbot. There might be other earbuds that offer better audio performance, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is the best option if you're on Android and want a seamless experience.

This is a discount of around $70 and represents a record-low price for the 11-inch tablet. The deal is available in multiple colorways and is one of the best Apple deals for Prime Day this year. This tablet made our list of the best iPads and we particularly recommend it for the budget-conscious. It may lack some of the bells and whistles of its more expensive cousins, but it still gets the job done. It's fast enough for most common tasks and the battery life is solid, at 10 hours per charge. It also ships with 6GB of RAM, which is a decent enough metric. The tablet integrates with Wi-Fi 6 and features a USB-C connector, along with a pair of 12MP cameras. There's also a Touch ID sensor, which can be used to unlock the device and to make payments. This is the most basic tablet in Apple's lineup, so it lacks some features. It doesn't integrate with the Apple Pencil Pro or the Magic Keyboard. The display is also not quite as gorgeous as the iPad Air or Pro, but it's still a Liquid Retina panel. Elsewhere among the Apple deals for Prime Day, you can get $150 off the iPad Air — both the 11-inch model and the 13-inch model.

          "standfirst": "October Prime Day has Engadget's favorite wireless headphones on sale. You can get Sony's excellent WH-1000XM6 for $20 off. While that's far from the steepest tech discount you'll see this week, it's a record low for this product. (After all, Sony only launched the XM6 in March, so this is still new gear.) You can get them today for $430. The WH-1000XM6 takes a leap forward in sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC) and other features. Our audio reviewer, Billy Steele, called them the best headphones you can buy right now. \"The crown is safe once again,\" he wrote. \"Sony has managed to overhaul its flagship headphones in all the right ways that keep the 1000X line atop our best headphones list.\" The XM6 has a powerful new chip, the QN3, that unlocks much of its potential. Sony also developed new drivers for this model, resulting in richer details, clearer vocals and a better overall balance. The headphones added four extra microphones to enhance ANC. The XM6 is especially improved at blocking out voices. If you're a fan of spatial effects, which simulate a wider soundstage, Sony added that for this generation. The (optional) 360 Spatial Sound feature transforms regular stereo content into something with a surround-sound effect. It's similar to what Apple and Bose have in their models. It's yet another audio effect option in Sony's app, alongside 360 Reality Audio and DSEE Extreme upscaling. The headphones are no slouch in the battery life department. The XM6 is rated for up to 30 hours with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off. In Engadget's testing, we had no problem hitting those advertised figures. If you'd rather save more money for a lesser (but still great) pair of cans, Sony's last-gen model is also on sale. You can get the WH-1000XM5 for $100 off. The 2022 flagship headphones offer premium sound, ANC, and battery life. Typically $400, you can get them during October Prime Day for $298.

          "title": "AI21’s Jamba reasoning 3B redefines what 'small' means in LLMs — 250K context on a laptop",
          "standfirst": "The latest addition to the small model wave for enterprises comes from AI21 Labs, which is betting that bringing models to devices will free up traffic in data centers. AI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B, a “tiny” open-source model that can run extended reasoning, code generation and respond based on ground truth. Jamba Reasoning 3B handles more than 250,000 tokens and can run inference on edge devices. The company said Jamba Reasoning 3B works on devices such as laptops and mobile phones. Ori Goshen, co-CEO of AI21, told VentureBeat that the company sees more enterprise use cases for small models, mainly because moving most inference to devices frees up data centers. “What we&#x27;re seeing right now in the industry is an economics issue where there are very expensive data center build-outs, and the revenue that is generated from the data centers versus the depreciation rate of all their chips shows the math doesn&#x27;t add up,” Goshen said. He added that in the future “the industry by and large would be hybrid in the sense that some of the computation will be on devices locally and other inference will move to GPUs.”Tested on a MacBook Jamba Reasoning 3B combines the Mamba architecture and Transformers to allow it to run a 250K token window on devices. AI21 said it can do 2-4x faster inference speeds. Goshen said the Mamba architecture significantly contributed to the model’s speed. Jamba Reasoning 3B’s hybrid architecture also allows it to reduce memory requirements, thereby reducing its computing needs. AI21 tested the model on a standard MacBook Pro and found that it can process 35 tokens per second. Goshen said the model works best for tasks involving function calling, policy-grounded generation and tool routing. He said that simple requests, such as asking for information about a forthcoming meeting and asking the model to create an agenda for it, could be done on devices. The more complex reasoning tasks can be saved for GPU clusters. Small models in enterpriseEnterprises have been interested in using a mix of small models, some of which are specifically designed for their industry and some that are condensed versions of LLMs. In September, Meta released MobileLLM-R1, a family of reasoning models ranging from 140M to 950M parameters. These models are designed for math, coding and scientific reasoning rather than chat applications. MobileLLM-R1 can run on compute-constrained devices. Google’s Gemma was one of the first small models to come to the market, designed to run on portable devices like laptops and mobile phones. Gemma has since been expanded. Companies like FICO have also begun building their own models. FICO launched its FICO Focused Language and FICO Focused Sequence small models that will only answer finance-specific questions. Goshen said the big difference their model offers is that it’s even smaller than most models and yet it can run reasoning tasks without sacrificing speed. Benchmark testing In benchmark testing, Jamba Reasoning 3B demonstrated strong performance compared to other small models, including Qwen 4B, Meta’s Llama 3.2B-3B, and Phi-4-Mini from Microsoft. It outperformed all models on the IFBench test and Humanity’s Last Exam, although it came in second to Qwen 4 on MMLU-Pro. Goshen said another advantage of small models like Jamba Reasoning 3B is that they are highly steerable and provide better privacy options to enterprises because the inference is not sent to a server elsewhere. “I do believe there’s a world where you can optimize for the needs and the experience of the customer, and the models that will be kept on devices are a large part of it,” he said.",

He added that in the future “the industry by and large would be hybrid in the sense that some of the computation will be on devices locally and other inference will move to GPUs.”Tested on a MacBook Jamba Reasoning 3B combines the Mamba architecture and Transformers to allow it to run a 250K token window on devices. AI21 said it can do 2-4x faster inference speeds. Goshen said the Mamba architecture significantly contributed to the model’s speed. Jamba Reasoning 3B’s hybrid architecture also allows it to reduce memory requirements, thereby reducing its computing needs. AI21 tested the model on a standard MacBook Pro and found that it can process 35 tokens per second. Goshen said the model works best for tasks involving function calling, policy-grounded generation and tool routing. He said that simple requests, such as asking for information about a forthcoming meeting and asking the model to create an agenda for it, could be done on devices. The more complex reasoning tasks can be saved for GPU clusters. Small models in enterpriseEnterprises have been interested in using a mix of small models, some of which are specifically designed for their industry and some that are condensed versions of LLMs. In September, Meta released MobileLLM-R1, a family of reasoning models ranging from 140M to 950M parameters. These models are designed for math, coding and scientific reasoning rather than chat applications. MobileLLM-R1 can run on compute-constrained devices. Google’s Gemma was one of the first small models to come to the market, designed to run on portable devices like laptops and mobile phones. Gemma has since been expanded. Companies like FICO have also begun building their own models. FICO launched its FICO Focused Language and FICO Focused Sequence small models that will only answer finance-specific questions. Goshen said the big difference their model offers is that it’s even smaller than most models and yet it can run reasoning tasks without sacrificing speed. Benchmark testing In benchmark testing, Jamba Reasoning 3B demonstrated strong performance compared to other small models, including Qwen 4B, Meta’s Llama 3.2B-3B, and Phi-4-Mini from Microsoft. It outperformed all models on the IFBench test and Humanity’s Last Exam, although it came in second to Qwen 4 on MMLU-Pro. Goshen said another advantage of small models like Jamba Reasoning 3B is that they are highly steerable and provide better privacy options to enterprises because the inference is not sent to a server elsewhere. “I do believe there’s a world where you can optimize for the needs and the experience of the customer, and the models that will be kept on devices are a large part of it,” he said.",

          "standfirst": "In a packed hall at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman laid out a bold vision to remake the digital world. The company that brought generative AI to the mainstream with a simple chatbot is now building the foundations for its next act: a comprehensive computing platform designed to move beyond the screen and browser, with legendary designer Jony Ive enlisted to help shape its physical form.At its third annual DevDay, OpenAI unveiled a suite of tools that signals a strategic pivot from a model provider to a full-fledged ecosystem. The message was clear: the era of simply asking an AI questions is over. The future is about commanding AI to perform complex tasks, build software autonomously, and live inside every application, a transition Altman framed as moving from \"systems that you can ask anything to, to systems that you can ask to do anything for you.\" The day’s announcements were a three-pronged assault on the status quo, targeting how users interact with software, how developers build it, and how businesses deploy intelligent agents. But it was the sessions held behind closed doors, away from the public livestream, that revealed the true scope of OpenAI’s ambition — a future that includes new hardware, a relentless pursuit of computational power, and a philosophical quest to redefine our relationship with technology.From chatbot to operating system: The new &#x27;App Store&#x27;The centerpiece of the public-facing keynote was the transformation of ChatGPT itself. With the new Apps SDK, OpenAI is turning its wildly popular chatbot into a dynamic, interactive platform, effectively an operating system where developers can build and distribute their own applications.“Today, we&#x27;re going to open up ChatGPT for developers to build real apps inside of ChatGPT,” Altman announced during the keynote presentation to applause. “This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with.”Live demonstrations showcased apps from partners like Coursera, Canva, and Zillow running seamlessly within a chat conversation. A user could watch a machine learning lecture, ask ChatGPT to explain a concept in real-time, and then use Canva to generate a poster based on the conversation, all without leaving the chat interface. The apps can render rich, interactive UIs, even going full-screen to offer a complete experience, like exploring a Zillow map of homes.For developers, this represents a powerful new distribution channel. “When you build with the Apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chat users,” Altman said, highlighting a direct path to a massive user base that has grown to over 800 million weekly active users. In a private press conference later, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, elaborated on the grander vision. \"We never meant to build a chatbot,\" he stated. \"When we set out to make ChatGPT, we meant to build a super assistant and we got a little sidetracked. And one of the tragedies of getting a little sidetracked is that we built a great chatbot, but we are the first ones to say that not all software needs to be a chatbot, not all interaction with the commercial world needs to be a chatbot.\"Turley emphasized that while OpenAI is excited about natural language interfaces, \"the interface really needs to evolve, which is why you see so much UI in the demos today. In fact, you can even go full screen and chat is in the background.\" He described a future where users might \"start your day in ChatGPT, just because it kind of has become the de facto entry point into the commercial web and into a lot of software,\" but clarified that \"our incentive is not to keep you in. Our product is to allow other people to build amazing businesses on top and to evolve the form factor of software.\"The rise of the agents: Building the &#x27;do anything&#x27; AIIf apps are about bringing the world into ChatGPT, the new \"Agent Kit\" is about sending AI out into the world to get things done. OpenAI is providing a complete \"set of building blocks... to help you take agents from prototype to production,\" Altman explained in his keynote. Agent Kit is an integrated development environment for creating autonomous AI workers. It features a visual canvas to design complex workflows, an embeddable chat interface (\"Chat Kit\") for deploying agents in any app, and a sophisticated evaluation suite to measure and improve performance.A compelling demo from financial operations platform Ramp showed how Agent Kit was used to build a procurement agent. An employee could simply type, \"I need five more ChatGPT business seats,\" and the agent would parse the request, check it against company expense policies, find vendor details, and prepare a virtual credit card for the purchase — a process that once took weeks now completed in minutes. This push into agents is a direct response to a growing enterprise need to move beyond AI as a simple information retrieval tool and toward AI as a productivity engine that automates complex business processes. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI&#x27;s COO, noted that for enterprise adoption, \"you needed this kind of shift to more agentic AI that could actually do things for you, versus just respond with text outputs.\" The future of code and the Jony Ive bBombshellPerhaps the most profound shift is occurring in software development itself. Codex, OpenAI&#x27;s AI coding agent, has graduated from a research preview to a full-fledged product, now powered by a specialized version of the new GPT-5 model. It is, as one speaker put it, \"a teammate that understands your context.\" The capabilities are staggering. Developers can now assign Codex tasks directly from Slack, and the agent can autonomously write code, create pull requests, and even review other engineers&#x27; work on GitHub. A live demo showed Codex taking a simple photo of a whiteboard sketch and turning it into a fully functional, beautifully designed mobile app screen. Another demo showed an app that could \"self-evolve,\" reprogramming itself in real-time based on a user&#x27;s natural language request. But the day&#x27;s biggest surprise came in a closing fireside chat, which was not livestreamed, between Altman and Jony Ive, the iconic former chief design officer of Apple. The two revealed they have been collaborating for three years on a new family of AI-centric hardware.Ive, whose design philosophy shaped the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch, said his creative team’s purpose \"became clear\" with the launch of ChatGPT. He argued that our current relationship with technology is broken and that AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental reset.“I think it would be absurd to assume that you could have technology that is this breathtaking, delivered to us through legacy products, products that are decades old,” Ive said. “I see it as a chance to use this most remarkable capability to full-on address a lot of the overwhelm and despair that people feel right now.”While details of the devices remain secret, Ive spoke of his motivation in deeply human terms. “We love our species, and we want to be useful. We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given,” he said. He emphasized the importance of \"care\" in the design process, stating, \"We sense when people have cared... you sense carelessness. You sense when somebody does not care about you, they care about money and schedule.\" This collaboration confirms that OpenAI&#x27;s ambitions are not confined to the cloud; it is actively exploring the physical interface through which humanity will interact with its powerful new intelligence.The Unquenchable Thirst for ComputeUnderpinning this entire platform strategy is a single, overwhelming constraint: the availability of computing power. In both the private press conference and the un-streamed Developer State of the Union, OpenAI’s leadership returned to this theme again and again.“The degree to which we are all constrained by compute... Everyone is just so constrained on being able to offer the services at the scale required to get the revenue that at this point, we&#x27;re quite confident we can push it pretty far,” Altman told reporters. He added that even with massive new hardware partnerships with AMD and others, \"we&#x27;ll be saying the same thing again. We&#x27;re so convinced... There&#x27;s so much more demand.\" This explains the company’s aggressive, multi-billion-dollar investment in infrastructure. When asked about profitability, Altman was candid that the company is in a phase of \"investment and growth.\" He invoked a famous quote from Walt Disney, paraphrasing, \"We make more money so we can make more movies.\" For OpenAI, the \"movies\" are ever-more-powerful AI models.Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s President, put the ultimate goal in stark economic terms during the Developer State of the Union. \"AI is going to become, probably in the not too distant future, the fundamental driver of economic growth,\" he said. \"Asking ‘How much compute do you want?’ is a little bit like asking how much workforce do you want? The answer is, you can always get more out of more.\" As the day concluded and developers mingled at the reception, the scale of OpenAI&#x27;s project came into focus. Fueled by new models like the powerful GPT-5 Pro and the stunning Sora 2 video generator, the company is no longer just building AI.

          "title": "Google's AI can now surf the web for you, click on buttons, and fill out forms with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use",
          "standfirst": "Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into \"agents\" that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent (formerly known as \"Operator\") and Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use, both released over the last two years. Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM known as \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use,\" which can use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.\"These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an important next step in building general-purpose agents,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as part of a longer statement on the social network, X.The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.Instead, Google partnered with another company, Browserbase, founded by former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024, which offers virtual \"headless\" web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A \"headless\" browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \"Browser Arena\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform. The new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.Overall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.Brief User Hands-On TestsIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, \"The Life of A Showgirl.\"In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\") It did so in a matter of seconds.However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \"task competed\" message. I should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.Performance BenchmarksGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.Some highlights include:Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)WebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)AndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of accessOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.How It WorksAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 ProThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that. Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.",

Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \"Browser Arena\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform. The new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.Overall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.Brief User Hands-On TestsIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, \"The Life of A Showgirl.\"In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\") It did so in a matter of seconds.However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \"task competed\" message. I should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.Performance BenchmarksGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.Some highlights include:Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)WebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)AndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of accessOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.How It WorksAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 ProThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that. Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.",

          "title": "Has this stealth startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability? Meet AUI's Apollo-1",
          "standfirst": "For more than a decade, conversational AI has promised human-like assistants that can do more than chat. Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people outside of chat. Even the best AI models score only in the 30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard, a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks like TAU-Bench airline, which measures the reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights on behalf of a user, also don&#x27;t have much higher pass rates, with only 56% for the top performing agents and models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time. New York City-based Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc., co-founded by Ohad Elhelo and Ori Cohen, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably. The company’s new foundation model, called Apollo-1 — which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.It&#x27;s a hybrid architecture championed by even LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”AUI defines certainty as the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does. For example, on TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and posted on AUI&#x27;s website.Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. “Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet The Information, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. From Pattern Matching to Predictable ActionThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the next action in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a typed symbolic state.Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”A Foundation Model for Task ExecutionUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a foundation model for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a System Prompt.“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.Eight Years in the MakingAUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating procedural knowledge — steps, constraints, and flows — from descriptive knowledge like entities and attributes.“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over 90 percent task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with 60 percent for Claude-4. It completed 83 percent of live booking chats on Google Flights versus 22 percent for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and 91 percent of retail scenarios on Amazon versus 17 percent for Rufus.“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”A Complement, Not a CompetitorAUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. AUI has also confirmed a strategic partnership with Google and plans for general availability in November 2025, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”Toward Conversations That ActFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.",

If you don’t need the latest tech, though, you can save a lot more by grabbing the last-gen WH-1000XM5 in black, which are down to $250 ($150 off) at Amazon. That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on the older model, and a great deal on what was our favorite pair of noise-canceling headphones until the arrival of the newer XM6 in May. Sony WH-1000XM5 Where to Buy: $399.99 $250 at Amazon $399.99 $298 at Best Buy $399.99 $299.99 at Sony Although they’re a few years old, the Sony XM5 still have a lot to offer, like excellent noise cancellation, detail-rich sound, and enhanced voice call quality thanks to the inclusion of eight microphones. They’re also comfortable to wear over extended periods, with ear pads that are wider and offer just the right amount of cushion. And since the XM5s are mostly comprised of plastic — with some metal here and there — they’re relatively lightweight at 250 grams. That said, if you travel a lot, the XM5’s design may be seen as a downgrade compared to the older WH-1000XM4 and newer XM6. That’s because the headphones can’t fold. Instead, only the ear cups turn to lay the headphones flat, so they’re not as easy to pack when they’re in their case. However, if you plan to primarily use the XM5 at home, this is more or less a non-issue, but it’s worth keeping in mind. Sony is still bolstering the XM5 with new features, like audio sharing and Google’s Gemini Live conversational AI assistant. So, not only do you get great noise-canceling headphones for $149 off, but you also get new features that improve the experience compared to when they first launched. That’s a win-win.

MARANELLO, ITALY—The E-Building is one of the newest on Ferrari's sprawling factory complex. One of the first LEED-certified buildings in Italy, the gleaming white interior is the latest in flexible factory design, capable of assembling any model in the automaker's range. And from next year, that will include Ferrari's first electric vehicle. It's a momentous occasion for Ferrari, and one it's taking its time over—although it has now briefed us on some powertrain and chassis details, we'll have to wait until next year before seeing the interior or exterior of a car that it's calling the Ferrari Elettrica—for now at least. Ferrari says it considered an all-electric two-seater or even something with occasional rear seats, but the performance benefit of an electric powertrain wasn't enough to offset the added mass for either of those applications. Those calculations did work out in favor of a four-seater, though; the battery pack lowers the center of gravity by 3.1 inches (80 mm) compared to an internal combustion engine powertrain and reduces the polar moment of inertia by 20 percent.Read full article Comments",

In a case report published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, the expert and the man's other doctors lay out the masterful medical deduction that explained his remarkable case—which had an entirely unremarkable cause. It all started about two weeks before his hospital visit. A mild, dull pain had developed in the patient's right lower abdomen and back. Nine days later, a fever and body aches also developed. The next day, he went to urgent care, where clinicians gave him intravenous fluids and an intravenous pain reliever. His abdominal pain went away, and he was discharged. But the pain returned over the next few days, and with it came nausea and vomiting. He then started coughing and having trouble breathing.Read full article Comments",

The rule took effect in April 2024 after the FCC rejected ISPs' complaints that listing every fee they created would be too difficult. The rule applies specifically to recurring monthly fees \"that providers impose at their discretion, i.e., charges not mandated by a government.\" ISPs could comply with the rule either by listing the fees or by dropping the fees altogether and, if they choose, raising their overall prices by a corresponding amount. But the latter option wouldn't fit with the strategy of enticing customers with a low advertised price and hitting them with the real price on their monthly bills.

After more than five years of foldable phones, we can probably give up on the latter. Google's new Pixel 10 Pro Fold retains the $1,800 price tag of last year's model, and while it's improved in several key ways, spending almost two grand on any phone remains hard to justify. For those whose phones are a primary computing device or who simply love gadgets, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is still appealing. It offers the same refined Android experience as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, with much more screen real estate on which to enjoy it. Google also improved the hinge for better durability, shaved off some bezel, and boosted both charging speed and battery capacity. However, the form factor hasn't taken the same quantum leap as Samsung's latest foldable. An iterative (but good) design The Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't reinvent the wheel—it looks and feels almost exactly like last year's foldable, with a few minor tweaks centered around a new \"gearless\" hinge. Dropping the internal gears allegedly helps make the mechanism twice as durable. Google claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge will last for more than 10 years of folding and unfolding.Read full article Comments",

For example, people could set their Pop buttons to launch Philips Hue or Insteon lighting presets, play a playlist from their Sonos speaker, or control Lutron smart blinds. Each button could store three actions, worked by identifying smart home devices on a shared Wi-Fi network, and was controllable via a dedicated Android or iOS app. The Pop Home Switch Starter Pack launched at $100, and individual Pop Add-on Home Switches debuted at $40 each. A company spokesperson told Ars Technica that Logitech informed customers on September 29 that their Pop switches would soon become e-waste.

Tesla fans have long-awaited a cheaper entry-level model; this was supposed to be the $25,000 Model 2. But the development of that electric vehicle was shelved earlier last year as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making in favor of humanoid robots. However, car sales still make up the overwhelming majority of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter. The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has software-locked batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack.Read full article Comments",

In a press release dated October 8, Synology noted that with the release of its latest Disk Station Manager (DSM) update, some of its 2025 model-year products—specifically, the Plus, Value, and J-series DiskStation NAS devices—would \"support the installation and storage pool creation of non-validated third-party drives.\" This unexpected move comes just a few months after Synology aggressively expanded its \"verified drive\" policy down-market to the entire Plus line of DiskStations. Prior to today, the network-attached storage vendor had shown no signs of swerving from the decision, painting it as a pro-consumer move intended to enhance reliability. \"Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues,\" Synology previously claimed in an email to Ars. What is a “verified” or “validated” drive? Synology first released its own brand of hard disk drives back in 2021 and began requiring their use in a small but soon-to-increase number of its higher-end NAS products. Although the drives were rebadged offerings from other manufacturers—there are very few hard disk drive OEMs, and Synology isn't one of them—the company claimed that its branded disks underwent significant additional validation and testing that, when coupled with customized firmware, yielded reliability and performance improvements over off-the-shelf components.Read full article Comments",

But starting around 1990, chemists began developing techniques that allow us to build polymers with precisely defined structures. These polymers, called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have distinct chemical properties: large pores that can be used to filter or store gases, catalytic centers within the polymer, and more. On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize Committee honored three researchers for their role in developing MOFs: Richard Robson for demonstrating the first MOF, and Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi for developing them to their full potential. Building a structure Most polymers are built from individual molecules that are linked together by flexible bonds, allowing the molecules to flop around. As a result, in their final form as something like a plastic bag or a bike tire, the polymers are a complicated tangle, with molecules wrapped around each other in no particular order. We can still control some aspects of the resulting polymer by manipulating its bulk properties or changing the molecules it's built from, but there's not a lot of chemistry we can do beyond that.Read full article Comments",

Here’s what to know You still have access and coverage: For this year, anyone age 6 months and older will still have access to the shots, and the shots should be fully covered under private insurance plans and federal programs—including Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Vaccines for Children Program, and insurance plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act. In fact, for private insurance plans, AHIP—the trade organization that represents major insurers—had already stated that regardless of how this year's messy federal recommendations ended up, private insurance plans would maintain their previous coverage with no cost sharing.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis \"for the discovery of macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in an electrical circuit.\" The Nobel committee said during a media briefing that the laureates' work provides opportunities to develop \"the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.\" The three men will split the $1.1 million (11 million Swedish kronor) prize money. The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025. \"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. \"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\" When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.Read full article Comments",

Companies have used them to build machines with dozens to hundreds of qubits, the error rates are coming down, and they've largely shifted from worrying about basic scientific problems to dealing with engineering challenges. Yet even at this apparently late date in the field's development, there are companies that are still developing entirely new qubit technologies, betting the company that they have identified something that will let them scale in ways that enable a come-from-behind story. Recently, one of those companies published a paper that describes the physics of their qubit system, which involves lone electrons floating on top of liquid helium. Trapping single electrons So how do you get an electron to float on top of helium? To find out, Ars spoke with Johannes Pollanen, the chief scientific officer of EeroQ, the company that accomplished the new work. He said that it's actually old physics, with the first demonstrations of it having been done half a century ago.Read full article Comments",
