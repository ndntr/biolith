          "content": "The tech industry trade group NetChoice is suing Virginia over a new law that will restrict minors from using social media for more than one hour per day. The lawsuit, filed on Monday, asks the court to block the law over claims it violates the First Amendment by putting “unlawful barriers on how and when all Virginians can access free speech online.” Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed the social media bill (SB 854) into law in May, and it’s set to go into effect on January 1st, 2026. Under the law, social media platforms will have to prevent kids under 16 from using the sites for more than one hour every day unless they receive permission from a parent. In addition to restricting access to legal speech, NetChoice alleges that Virginia’s incoming law will require platforms to verify user ages in ways that would pose privacy and security risks. The law requires platforms to use “commercially reasonable methods,” which it says include a screen that prompts the user to enter a birth date. However, NetChoice argues that Virginia could go beyond this requirement, citing a post from Governor Youngkin on X, stating “platforms must verify age,” potentially referring to stricter methods, like having users submit a government ID or other personal information. We’ve already seen the risks of this data collection, as Discord revealed last month that around 70,000 users may have had their government IDs exposed during a customer service data breach related to age-related appeals. NetChoice, which is backed by tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, and Discord, alleges that the law puts a burden on minors’ ability to engage or consume speech online. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from placing these types of restrictions on accessing lawful and valuable speech, just in the same way that the government can&#8217;t tell you how long you could spend reading a book, watching a television program, or consuming a documentary,” Paul Taske, the codirector of the Netchoice Litigation Center, tells The Verge. NetChoice has filed — and won — lawsuits against several other states that have enacted laws requiring social media platforms to implement age verification requirements, though Virginia appears to be the first to impose a strict time limit for minors. Virginia — like numerous other states — also requires porn sites in the state to verify the ages of their users. “Virginia must leave the parenting decisions where they belong: with parents,” Taske says. “By asserting that authority for itself, Virginia not only violates its citizens’ rights to free speech but also exposes them to increased risk of privacy and security breaches.”",

          "title": "The best Black Friday TV deals we can find so far: Samsung, LG, TCL and more",
          "standfirst": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s OK to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales already floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. The current selection includes several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense, but we’ll update this post through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $800 at Amazon ($200 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step-up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that has received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a well-lit room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,400 at Amazon ($600 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Walmart. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the more expensive Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV for as little as possible, it'll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-tv-deals-we-can-find-so-far-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-181143919.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s OK to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales already floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. The current selection includes several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense, but we’ll update this post through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $800 at Amazon ($200 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step-up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that has received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a well-lit room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,400 at Amazon ($600 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look.

But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Walmart. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the more expensive Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses.

          "standfirst": "Google's DeepMind just released WeatherNext 2, a new version of its AI weather prediction model. The company promises that it \"delivers more efficient, more accurate and higher-resolution global weather predictions.\" To that end, it should be able to provide accurate forecasts up to two weeks out, including information on temperature, pressure and wind. It should also be able to better predict tropical storm tracks, according to researchers. This means that predictions of a hurricane's path should be accurate up to three days out. The previous model only predicted things up to two days ahead of the storm. The model also brings hourly forecasts into the mix. All told, Google says this new model is eight times faster than the previous iteration. This should help businesses like energy traders make more precise decisions, according to a report by Bloomberg. \"It gives you a more granular forecast,\" DeepMind AI researcher Akib Uddin said. \"Many other industries are quite interested in these one-hour steps. It helps them make more precise decisions. Their goal is, how can they make their business more resilient to weather?\" Google The improvements here stem from a new approach to weather models, as explained in this recently-published research paper. Older methods demanded the use of machine learning models that were built for image and video generation. This required repeated processing to ensure an accurate result. The new model only requires a single processing step, which also reduces reliance on costly AI computing systems. AI may not be great at everything, despite what proponents want you to believe, but it is great at predicting the weather. Newer models typically outperform traditional prediction methods, even those that rely on supercomputers. These models aren't perfect, however, as even Google has acknowledged that WeatherNext 2 will likely struggle to predict outlier rain and snow events. This is due to gaps in the training data. \"It’s one limitation of our forecast, but one that we are working on improving,” DeepMind research scientist Ferran Alet told Bloomberg. AI weather prediction is becoming a crowded field. Companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, AccuWeather and Huawei are all throwing their hats in the ring in one way or another.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/deepmind-releases-a-new-weather-forecasting-model-for-more-accurate-predictions-175451228.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Black Friday VPN deals: Get up to 75 percent off Proton VPN two-year plans",
          "standfirst": "Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. Proton VPN is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

Anker power banks are among the best. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than most brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, some of our favorite Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Best Black Friday Anker deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. With Black Friday deals, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s long enough and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that continually show up in our guides to the best accessories. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that don't quite fit into the categories above.

Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals next week are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Table of contents Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Black Friday deals under $50 Black Friday Apple deals Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals More Black Friday tech deals Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods 4 for $85 (34 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $170 (51 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals iRobot Roomba 104 Vac Robot Vacuum for $150 (40 percent off): This is an updated version of our favorite budget robot vacuum and it will make an excellent choice for anyone who has never used one of these devices before, or a gift for a new homeowner. Not only is the iRobot mobile app super easy to use, but this machine has strong suction power and good battery life, plus it will automatically return to its docking station when it needs a power-up. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599. More Black Friday tech deals Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $92 (32 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best power banks, this Anker brick is kind of a one-and-done device. It has enough capacity to charge all sorts of devices from smartphones to laptops to handheld gaming consoles, and it has two built-in USB-C cables so you don't even have to remember to bring your own to use it. Also available at Anker. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro.

          "standfirst": "You can already get a solid deal on a Roomba robot vacuum before Black Friday kicks off in earnest. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 40 percent off right now, taking its normal $250 price to a record low of $150. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots. An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's favorite budget robot vacuum, and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging. This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of its last earning statement. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.

That includes the new Apple Watch SE 3, which you can snag for only $200 right now. We consider this to be the best budget Apple Watch, and arguably the best smartwatch for folks who have never owned one before. The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you'll find in those more expensive devices as well. The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 3, which you can snag for $100 off. The sale model comes with 64GB of storage, a 49mm screen and GPS and cellular service. Notably, it's also only available with the one size, adjustable band and in two colors: a Black titanium case with Black Ocean band and a natural titanium Case with Anchor Blue Ocean band. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 came out in early September and is one of the first smartwatches to support satellite communications. This feature means you can call, send messages or share your location with emergency services through the watch — even if you don't have a connection. The new Ultra 3 also has a larger screen thanks to thinner bezels and a battery that can last for up to 42 hours.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday deals are starting to pop up across the web, and a great one to check out is at Dyson. While we still think you have the best shot to get the steepest discounts the closer to Black Friday we get, some of the discounts on Dyson's site right now are some of the best we've seen. One of those is $600 off the Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum, which is down to a record low of $400. Dyson was pretty late to the robot-vacuum party, but its entry was (and remains) one of the strongest in the category. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles like a self-emptying base or mopping capabilities, but it makes up for that by having probably the best suction power of any robovac we've tested. All kinds of debris will fall in its path: dirt, dust, food crumbs, pet hair and more. It also has excellent obstacle avoidance, so you'll rarely — if ever — have to dislodge it from getting stuck on the edge of a carpet or wedged in between furniture. Dyson's mobile app is easy to use as well, so if you're looking for a robot vacuum that does its main job incredibly well and you don't mind skipping on some extras, the 360 Vis Nav is a great option. Cordless vacuums are also a part of the sale. Take the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for just $270 at both Dyson and Amazon, which is a discount of $330. That's more than half off. Dyson devices are all over our list of the best cordless vacuums, and for good reason. The company makes effective products. The V9 Motorbar has been designed to clean all floor types, in addition to upholstery. It's also been engineered to squeeze into tight spots, which is great for hitting those oft-neglected parts of the home. The suction power is on point and the battery lasts for 40 minutes before requiring a charge. That's just enough time to vacuum a standard-sized home if you don't stop for too many breaks. The V9 is getting a bit long-in-the-tooth. If you want a newer model, the V11 Extra is on sale for $400, which is a discount of $260. This one boosts the suction power and increases the battery life to 60 minutes.

          "title": "For the Steam Machine to change PC gaming, Valve must solve Linux's anti-cheat problem",
          "standfirst": "Following months of rumors, Valve finally announced the new Steam Machine earlier this week. And while I might question the company's decision to ship a system with only 8GB of VRAM in 2026, I believe the \"Gabecube\" will do more for PC gaming than anything Microsoft has done in the last decade. With SteamOS and Linux, Valve has polished away many of the things that make PC gaming unapproachable to some people. Want to set a frame limit to extend your Steam Deck's battery life? It's an easy-to-find option in the Performance overlay, not something you need to dig through multiple menus to find. Want to suspend a game? That's possible on SteamOS. And now with the Steam Machine, Valve is poised to bring the fun of PC gaming to an entirely new audience: home console gamers. Even though I don't plan to buy one, selfishly I hope it's a runaway success. Like a lot of PC gamers I imagine, I'm ready to leave Windows behind. Over the last few years, Microsoft has proven to be a poor steward of the platform. The company seems more interested in pushing AI features few care for, rather than solving the issues that have plagued Windows for years. After all, it was only recently that Microsoft said it would tackle shader stutter, a problem that has plagued many recent AAA games. Worse yet, that solution may take years to fully implement. I want the Steam Machine to be the revolution that brings SteamOS to desktop PCs, but before that can happen, Valve must solve Linux's cheating problem. Right now, the Steam Deck covers two of the three pillars of PC gaming: indies and singleplayer AAA games. For some people, that's enough, but it leaves out a huge section of the PC market. Nearly four years after its release, you can't play some of the most popular competitive games, and it's all because of how easy it is to make cheating software for Linux-based operating systems.In a 2024 interview with The Verge, Riot's Phillip Koskinas summarized the issue concisely. \"You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,\" he told the outlet. \"You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.\"When Valve released the Steam Deck at the start of 2022, there was some hope games like Fortnite and Rainbow Six Siege would eventually be playable on the handheld, and for a while things looked positive. Toward the end of 2021, Valve announced Proton compatibility with BattlEye. A few months later, the company did the same for Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat. There's also Valve's in-house solution, VAC, which is fully supported and means the company's own games, including Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, are playable on Steam Deck. However, despite Valve's support for some of the most popular anti-cheat solutions on the market, many studios chose not to bring their competitive games to SteamOS, citing cheating concerns. Some notable examples include Fortnite, Valorant and PUBG. Those games have never been playable on Steam Deck. In fact, last fall EA withdrew Linux and Steam Deck support for Apex Legends, one of the few competitive shooters you could play on Valve's handheld. \"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,\" the company said at the time. \"We believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.\" For EA, Riot, Epic and developers of other popular competitive games, the issue is two-fold: Cheating software is harder to detect when it's used on Linux. More importantly, for many of them there aren't enough Linux players to justify the resources needed to secure their games for every Linux distribution. For example, when Riot made its Vanguard software a requirement to play League of Legends in 2024, the studio said there were just over 800 daily users playing the game on Linux. For context, millions of people League every day. Put another way, it's a chicken and egg problem. The Steam Machine represents an opportunity for Valve. According to Are We Anti-Cheat Yet, a crowd-sourced database listing games that require anti-cheat software and whether they work through Linux or Valve's Proton compatibility layer, 682 games don't work for one reason or another. That means more than half of the 1,136 games that require anti-cheat software can't be played on SteamOS. With the nature of Linux being what it is, it's unlikely Valve could make even the most popular kernel-level anti-cheat apps work across every Linux distribution, and based on the company's approach, it doesn't have an interest in doing that. However, if Valve made a better sandbox for developers to secure their games, we could absolutely see a SteamOS version of Valorant, for instance. Studios will go where their players are. The Steam Deck has proven that. And if the Steam Machine becomes popular enough to warrant companies like EA to bring their games to SteamOS and Linux, the PC gaming landscape will suddenly be very different.

Right now, the Steam Deck covers two of the three pillars of PC gaming: indies and singleplayer AAA games. For some people, that's enough, but it leaves out a huge section of the PC market. Nearly four years after its release, you can't play some of the most popular competitive games, and it's all because of how easy it is to make cheating software for Linux-based operating systems.In a 2024 interview with The Verge, Riot's Phillip Koskinas summarized the issue concisely. \"You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,\" he told the outlet. \"You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.\"When Valve released the Steam Deck at the start of 2022, there was some hope games like Fortnite and Rainbow Six Siege would eventually be playable on the handheld, and for a while things looked positive. Toward the end of 2021, Valve announced Proton compatibility with BattlEye. A few months later, the company did the same for Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat. There's also Valve's in-house solution, VAC, which is fully supported and means the company's own games, including Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, are playable on Steam Deck. However, despite Valve's support for some of the most popular anti-cheat solutions on the market, many studios chose not to bring their competitive games to SteamOS, citing cheating concerns. Some notable examples include Fortnite, Valorant and PUBG. Those games have never been playable on Steam Deck. In fact, last fall EA withdrew Linux and Steam Deck support for Apex Legends, one of the few competitive shooters you could play on Valve's handheld. \"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,\" the company said at the time. \"We believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.\" For EA, Riot, Epic and developers of other popular competitive games, the issue is two-fold: Cheating software is harder to detect when it's used on Linux. More importantly, for many of them there aren't enough Linux players to justify the resources needed to secure their games for every Linux distribution. For example, when Riot made its Vanguard software a requirement to play League of Legends in 2024, the studio said there were just over 800 daily users playing the game on Linux. For context, millions of people League every day. Put another way, it's a chicken and egg problem. The Steam Machine represents an opportunity for Valve. According to Are We Anti-Cheat Yet, a crowd-sourced database listing games that require anti-cheat software and whether they work through Linux or Valve's Proton compatibility layer, 682 games don't work for one reason or another. That means more than half of the 1,136 games that require anti-cheat software can't be played on SteamOS. With the nature of Linux being what it is, it's unlikely Valve could make even the most popular kernel-level anti-cheat apps work across every Linux distribution, and based on the company's approach, it doesn't have an interest in doing that. However, if Valve made a better sandbox for developers to secure their games, we could absolutely see a SteamOS version of Valorant, for instance. Studios will go where their players are. The Steam Deck has proven that. And if the Steam Machine becomes popular enough to warrant companies like EA to bring their games to SteamOS and Linux, the PC gaming landscape will suddenly be very different.

One of the best discounts at the moment is on the Delta Pro 3, which is 37 percent off and down to $2,299. That's the lowest we've seen it and, considering it typically costs $3,699, it's a great deal. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,599. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle. The Delta Pro 3 is just one of the products on sale right now. The Delta Pro Ultra, which is intended as a whole-home backup, is down to $3,999. This represents a savings of more than $2,000.

          "standfirst": "Gaming laptops have gone from being ugly bricks to sleek machines that can match the power of desktops. If you’re looking to get crazy high framerates, or if you just want to revel in the glory of real-time ray tracing, you’ll definitely be able to find a gaming laptop that suits your needs. And it’s also easier than ever to connect them to TVs and monitors for big-screen gaming.One of the biggest advantages of a gaming laptop is its flexibility. You don’t need to worry about bulky setups or being tethered to one spot. Plus, with features like high refresh rate displays, powerful GPUs and cutting-edge processors, these machines are more than capable of handling AAA titles, eSports and even VR gaming. Many gaming laptops now come equipped with RGB-lit keyboards, advanced cooling systems and next-gen SSD storage to keep up with your gaming needs, too. We’ve tested a number of the latest gaming laptops to see which are worth your money. Table of contents Best gaming laptops for 2025 Other gaming laptops we’ve tested What to look for in a gaming laptop How we test gaming laptops Best gaming laptops for 2025 Other gaming laptops we’ve tested Framework Laptop 16 We were eager to test the Framework Laptop 16 since it promised both modular customizability and a decent amount of gaming power. But while we appreciated just how repairable and upgradeable it is, its actual gaming performance was middling for its high price. You could always buy it without the additional GPU, but that makes it more of a daily workhorse than a gaming system. MSI Stealth Studio 14 On a brighter note, we were pleased to see MSI return to form with the Stealth Studio 14, which is far faster and more attractive than the previous model. Razer Blade 16 and 18 We were amazed to see a genuine 4K/1080p native screen in the Razer Blade 16, but it’s far too expensive and impractical, even for such a pricey brand. Similarly, we found the Razer Blade 18 to be both oversized and overpriced. What to look for in a gaming laptop Price Your laptop buying journey starts and ends with the amount of money you're willing to spend. No surprise there. The good news: There are plenty of options for gamers at every budget. In particular, we're seeing some great entry-level PC gaming choices under $1,000, like the Acer Nitro V. Some cheap gaming laptops may feel a bit flimsier than pricier models, and they'll likely skimp on RAM, storage and overall power. But most cheaper laptops should be able to handle the majority of video games running at 1080p at 60 frames per second, which is the bare minimum you'd want from any system. Things get interesting when you start looking at the best gaming laptops in the mid-range space, with prices around $1,500. At that point, you'll start finding PCs like the ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14, one of our favorite gaming notebooks. In general, you can look forward to far better build quality than budget gaming laptops (metal cases!), improved graphics power and enough RAM and storage space to handle the most demanding games. These are the gaming machines we'd recommend for most people, as they'll keep you gaming and working for years before you need to worry about an upgrade. If you're willing to spend around $2,000 or more, you can consider more premium options like the Razer Blade, which is on-par with some of the best gaming PCs. Expect impeccably polished cases, the fastest hardware on the market and ridiculously thin designs. The sky's the limit here: Alienware's uber customizable Area 51m is an enormous beast that can cost up to $4,700. Few people need a machine that high-end, but if you're a gamer with extra cash to burn, it may be worth taking a close look at some of these pricier systems. CPU and GPU The answer to this question used to be relatively simple: Just get an Intel chip with an NVIDIA GPU. But over the last few years AMD has stepped up its game with its Ryzen notebook processors, which are better suited for juggling multiple tasks at once (like streaming to Twitch while blasting fools in Fortnite). Intel responded with its recent lineup of 13th-gen and Core Ultra chips, but it’s nice to have decent AMD Ryzen alternatives available, especially since they’re often cheaper than comparable Intel models. When it comes to video cards, though, AMD is still catching up. Its Radeon RX 7000M GPU has been a fantastic performer, but it lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to newer features like ray tracing. At the very least, a Radeon-powered notebook can approach the general gaming performance of the NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPUs. If you want to future-proof your purchase, or you’re just eager to see how much better ray tracing can make your games look, you’re probably better off with an NVIDIA graphics card. They’re in far more systems, and it’s clear that they have better optimized ray tracing technology. NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs also feature the company’s DLSS technology, which uses AI to upscale games to higher resolutions. That’ll let you play a game like Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K with faster frame rates. That’s useful if you’re trying to take advantage of a high refresh rate monitor. You’ll still find plenty of laptops with NVIDIA’s older RTX 40-series GPUs these days, and they’ll still give you tremendous performance. But to be safe, it’s probably worth opting for the newer RTX 50-series systems, since they support the newer DLSS 4 technology and offer a wealth of performance upgrades. The entry-level RTX 5060 is a solid start, but we’d suggest going for a 5070 if you’re aiming to maximize your framerates on faster screens. The RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are both incredibly powerful, but they typically make systems far too expensive for most users. It’s worth noting that NVIDIA’s mobile graphics cards aren’t directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak voltages to make gaming performance better in a thinner case. Basically, these laptops may not be desktop replacements — don’t be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they’re all equipped with the same GPU. Screen and refresh rate Screen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 14-inch laptops offer the best portability, while 16-inch models are a bit more immersive. And of course, you can go all the way up to an 18-inch screen to maximize your real estate. There’s also plenty to consider beyond screen size — like refresh rates. Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or at 60Hz. That's a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you'd want in any gaming notebook — and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of this is in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible. For games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly, as if you're unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage. Not to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync. They're both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen's refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of one of the best gaming monitors with a high refresh rate; they're not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement. It’s also worth paying attention to a gaming laptop’s display technology. The cheapest models will have basic LCD screens, but as you step up in price you’ll find brighter and bolder Mini LED and OLED displays. OLED will cost the most, but it offers the best contrast and extremely dark black levels. Mini LED laptops can get brighter and they’re typically cheaper than OLED. See Also: Best Laptops for 2023 Best Cheap Windows Laptops Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023 Best Chromebooks Best Laptops for College Students Other things to remember when buying a gaming laptop: Get at least 16GB of RAM. If you want to future-proof your system a bit, go for 32GB of RAM (memory is a lot cheaper than it used to be). Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I'd recommend aiming for at least a 1TB M.2 SSD, and ideally a 2TB model if you can swing it. (4TB SSD are also a lot more attainable these days.) Some laptops also have room for standard SATA hard drives, which are far cheaper than M.2s and can hold more data. Try out a system before you buy it. I'd recommend snagging the best gaming laptop for you from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don't like it, you can always return it. Don't forget about accessories! For the best performance, you'll need a good mouse, keyboard and a headset — these are some of the best gaming accessories for gaming PCs and laptops. How we test gaming laptops We review gaming laptops with the same amount of rigor as traditional notebooks. We test build quality by checking cases for any undesirable flexible spots, as well as the strength of screen hinges during furious typing and Call of Duty sessions. We benchmark every gaming notebook with PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark tests, Cinebench and Geekbench. We also use NVIDIA’s Frameview app to measure the average framerates in Cyberpunk 2077, Overwatch 2 and other titles. For media creation, we transcode a 4K movie clip into 1080p using Handbrake’s CPU and GPU encoding options. Displays are tested under indoor and outdoor lighting with productivity apps, video playback and gameplay. We also try to stress the full refresh rate of every gaming notebook’s screen by benchmarking Halo Infinite, Overwatch 2 and other titles. Laptop speakers are judged by how well they can play back music, movies and the occasional game session with detail and clarity, and without any obvious distortion. When it comes to battery life, we see how long gaming systems last with a mixture of real-world productivity apps and gameplay, and we also test with PCMark 10’s “Modern office” battery test. In addition, we’re judging the quality of a machine’s keyboard with typing tests as well as relative accuracy and comfort during extended gaming sessions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",

The entry-level RTX 5060 is a solid start, but we’d suggest going for a 5070 if you’re aiming to maximize your framerates on faster screens. The RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 are both incredibly powerful, but they typically make systems far too expensive for most users. It’s worth noting that NVIDIA’s mobile graphics cards aren’t directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak voltages to make gaming performance better in a thinner case. Basically, these laptops may not be desktop replacements — don’t be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they’re all equipped with the same GPU. Screen and refresh rate Screen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 14-inch laptops offer the best portability, while 16-inch models are a bit more immersive. And of course, you can go all the way up to an 18-inch screen to maximize your real estate. There’s also plenty to consider beyond screen size — like refresh rates. Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or at 60Hz. That's a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you'd want in any gaming notebook — and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of this is in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible. For games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly, as if you're unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage. Not to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync. They're both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen's refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of one of the best gaming monitors with a high refresh rate; they're not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement. It’s also worth paying attention to a gaming laptop’s display technology. The cheapest models will have basic LCD screens, but as you step up in price you’ll find brighter and bolder Mini LED and OLED displays. OLED will cost the most, but it offers the best contrast and extremely dark black levels. Mini LED laptops can get brighter and they’re typically cheaper than OLED.

If you want to future-proof your system a bit, go for 32GB of RAM (memory is a lot cheaper than it used to be). Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I'd recommend aiming for at least a 1TB M.2 SSD, and ideally a 2TB model if you can swing it. (4TB SSD are also a lot more attainable these days.) Some laptops also have room for standard SATA hard drives, which are far cheaper than M.2s and can hold more data. Try out a system before you buy it. I'd recommend snagging the best gaming laptop for you from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don't like it, you can always return it. Don't forget about accessories! For the best performance, you'll need a good mouse, keyboard and a headset — these are some of the best gaming accessories for gaming PCs and laptops. How we test gaming laptops We review gaming laptops with the same amount of rigor as traditional notebooks. We test build quality by checking cases for any undesirable flexible spots, as well as the strength of screen hinges during furious typing and Call of Duty sessions. We benchmark every gaming notebook with PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark tests, Cinebench and Geekbench. We also use NVIDIA’s Frameview app to measure the average framerates in Cyberpunk 2077, Overwatch 2 and other titles. For media creation, we transcode a 4K movie clip into 1080p using Handbrake’s CPU and GPU encoding options. Displays are tested under indoor and outdoor lighting with productivity apps, video playback and gameplay. We also try to stress the full refresh rate of every gaming notebook’s screen by benchmarking Halo Infinite, Overwatch 2 and other titles. Laptop speakers are judged by how well they can play back music, movies and the occasional game session with detail and clarity, and without any obvious distortion. When it comes to battery life, we see how long gaming systems last with a mixture of real-world productivity apps and gameplay, and we also test with PCMark 10’s “Modern office” battery test. In addition, we’re judging the quality of a machine’s keyboard with typing tests as well as relative accuracy and comfort during extended gaming sessions.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",

That adoption is important, but it doesn’t displace the value of Phi-4 as an experimental proof: Phi-4 was designed as a testbed for a data-first training methodology, and its documentation reads like a smart data playbook for teams that want to replicate that approach.The Phi-4 team has shared a repeatable SFT playbook that includes a 1.4-million-prompt response set. It’s built around “teachable” edge examples, questions that are neither too easy nor too difficult, chosen to push the model’s reasoning. Each topic, such as math or code, is tuned separately and then combined with synthetic rewrites that turn complex tasks into forms that can be checked automatically.

Phi-4 reasoning takes a different path, showing that carefully curated data can achieve similar or even better results with far less.The team assembled a dataset covering STEM, coding, and safety. Despite its small size, it outperformed models trained on orders of magnitude more data. In benchmarks, the 14B Phi-4 reasoning model outperformed OpenAI’s o1-mini and DeepSeek’s 70B distilled model across most reasoning tasks, and approached the full DeepSeek-R1 (671B) on challenging math (AIME) questions. With just 14 billion parameters, Phi-4 reasoning delivers the following results when compared to other leading models:Benchmark (task)Phi-4 reasoningComparison model (size)Comparison scoreDate / SourceAIME 2024 (math olympiad)75.3%o1-mini63.6%Microsoft Phi-4 model card (Apr 2025).

(Hugging Face)Table: Phi-4 reasoning performance across benchmarks compared to other models. Source: MicrosoftThe key to this is filtering for quality over quantity. Much of the generic data is either too easy (the base model already knows it) or too hard (no learning signal). The Phi-4 team explicitly discards such examples. “Given the strong baseline reasoning capabilities of Phi-4, many initial seed questions are already handled competently,” they note. “To make further learning impactful, we specifically target seeds situated at the edge of Phi-4’s current abilities.” In practice, they rely on LLM-based evaluation. For each candidate question, a strong reference model (like GPT-4) generates an “answer key,” and the answers from weaker models are compared. If the weaker model disagrees enough, it indicates a teachable gap. Those questions are retained, while trivially solved or utterly unsolvable questions are dropped. For example, a simple arithmetic problem might be dropped (too easy), and an extremely obscure theorem proof might be dropped (too hard) as well. But a moderately challenging geometry problem that Phi-4 gets wrong is included.This “sweet spot” approach ensures every example forces the model to stretch its reasoning. By focusing on multi-step problems rather than rote recall, they pack maximum learning into 1.4M examples. As the authors explain, training on these carefully chosen seeds “leads to broad generalization across both reasoning-specific and general-purpose tasks.” In effect, Phi-4 reasoning demonstrates that intelligent data selection can outperform brute force scaling. Independent domain optimizationPhi-4 reasoning’s data are grouped by domain (math, coding, puzzles, safety, etc.). Rather than blending everything at once, the team tunes each domain’s mix separately and then merges them. This relies on an “additive property”: Optimizing math data in isolation and code data in isolation yields weights that, when concatenated, still give gains in both areas. In practice, they first tuned the math dataset to saturation on math benchmarks, then did the same for code, and finally simply added the code data into the math recipe. The result was improved performance on both math and coding tasks, without retraining from scratch.This modular approach offers clear practical advantages. This means a small team can first refine just the math dataset, achieve strong math performance, and then later add the coding data without redoing the math tuning.However, the Phi-4 authors caution that scaling this method to many domains remains an open question. While the approach “worked very well” for their math+code mix, they note, “it is not known whether this method can scale to dozens or hundreds of domains,” a direction they acknowledge as a valuable area for future research. In short, the additive strategy is effective, but expanding into new domains must be approached carefully, as it may introduce unforeseen interactions.Despite potential pitfalls, the additive strategy proved effective in Phi-4 reasoning. By treating each domain independently, the team avoided complex joint optimization and narrowed the search space for data mixtures. This approach allows incremental scaling of domains. Teams can begin by tuning the math SFT, then incorporate the code dataset, and later expand to additional specialized tasks, all while maintaining prior performance gains. This is a practical advantage for resource-constrained teams. Instead of requiring a large group of experts to manage a complex, multi-domain dataset, a small team can focus on one data silo at a time.Synthetic data transformationSome reasoning problems, such as abstract proofs or creative tasks, are difficult to verify automatically. Yet automated verification (for RL reward shaping) is very valuable. Phi-4 reasoning tackled this by transforming hard prompts into easier-to-check forms. For example, the team rewrote a subset of coding problems as word puzzles or converted some math problems to have concise numeric answers. These “synthetic seed data” preserve the underlying reasoning challenge but make correctness easier to test. Think of it as giving the model a simplified version of the riddle that still teaches the same logic. This engineering hack enables downstream RL to use clear reward signals on tasks that would otherwise be too open-ended. Here’s an example of synthetic data transformation:Raw web dataSynthetic dataOn the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, points M and N are taken, respectively. It turns out that the perimeter of △AMC is equal to the perimeter of △CNA, and the perimeter of △ANB is equal to the perimeter of △CMB. Prove that △ABC is isosceles.ABC is a triangle with AB=13 and BC=10. On the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, points M and N are taken, respectively. It turns out that the perimeter of △AMC is equal to the perimeter of △CNA, and the perimeter of △ANB is equal to the perimeter of △CMB. What is AC?Table: Rewriting seed data from the web (left) into verifiable synthetic questions for SFT and RL (right). Source: MicrosoftNote that by assigning numeric values (AB=13, BC=10) and asking “What is AC?”, the answer becomes a single number, which can be easily checked for correctness.Other teams have applied similar domain-specific tricks. For example, chemistry LLMs like FutureHouse’s ether0 model generate molecules under strict pKa or structural constraints, using crafted reward functions to ensure valid chemistry. In mathematics, the Kimina-Prover model by Numina translates natural-language theorems into the Lean formal system, so reinforcement learning can verify correct proofs. These examples highlight how synthetic augmentation, when paired with verifiable constraints, can push models to perform well in highly specialized domains.In practical terms, engineers should embrace synthetic data but keep it grounded. Heuristics like “convert to numeric answers” or “decompose a proof into checkable steps” can make training safer and more efficient. At the same time, maintain a pipeline of real (organic) problems as well, to ensure breadth. The key is balance. Use synthetic transformations to unlock difficult verification problems, but don’t rely on them exclusively. Real-world diversity still matters. Following this approach, the model is guided toward a clearly defined, discrete objective.Here are some results on Phi-4 reasoning models:Practical implementation for enterprisesAI teams looking to apply Phi-4 reasoning’s insights can follow a series of concrete steps to implement the approach effectively.Identifying the model’s edgeDetect your model’s “edge” by identifying where the base LLM struggles. One way is to use its confidence or agreement scores. For example, generate several answers per prompt (using a tool like Hugging Face’s vLLM for fast sampling) and see where consensus breaks. Those prompts at the margin of confidence are your teachable examples. By focusing on these low-confidence questions rather than the questions it already gets right, you ensure each new example is worth learning.Isolating domains for targeted tuningTune one domain at a time rather than mixing all data genres upfront. Pick the highest-value domain for your app (math, code, legal, etc.) and craft a small SFT dataset for just that. Iterate on the mix (balancing difficulty, source types, etc.) until performance saturates on domain-specific benchmarks. Then freeze that mix and add the next domain. This modular tuning follows Phi-4 reasoning’s “additive” strategy. It avoids cross-talk since you preserve gains in domain A even as you improve domain B.Expanding with synthetic augmentationLeverage synthetic augmentation when gold-standard answers are scarce or unverifiable. For instance, if you need to teach a proof assistant but can’t autocheck proofs, transform them into arithmetic puzzles or shorter proofs that can be verified. Use your LLM to rewrite or generate these variants (Phi-4 used this to turn complex word problems into numeric ones). Synthetic augmentation also lets you expand data cheaply. Once you have a validated small set, you can “multiply” it by having the LLM generate paraphrases, variations, or intermediate reasoning steps.Scaling through a two-phase strategyUse a two-phase training strategy that begins with exploration followed by scaling. In Phase 1 (exploration), run short fine-tuning experiments on a focused dataset (e.g., one domain) with limited compute. Track a few key metrics (benchmarks or held-out tasks) each run. Rapidly iterate hyperparameters and data mixes. The Phi-4 paper demonstrates that this speeds up progress, as small experiments helped the team discover a robust recipe before scaling up. Only once you see consistent gains do you move to Phase 2 (scaling), where you combine your verified recipes across domains and train longer (in Phi-4’s case, ~16 billion tokens). Although this stage is more compute-intensive, the risk is significantly reduced by the prior experimentation.Monitor for trigger points such as a significant uplift on validation tasks or stable metric trends. When those appear, it’s time to scale. If not, refine the recipe more first. This disciplined two-phase loop saves resources and keeps the team agile.In practice, many teams at Hugging Face and elsewhere have followed similar advice. For example, while developing conversational model SmolLM2, the team noticed poor chat performance in Phase 1. They then generated ~500K synthetic multi-turn dialogues and re-trained, which “significantly improved both downstream performance and its overall ‘vibes,’” as one researcher reports. This represents a concrete win, achieved through a targeted synthetic data injection based on an initial feedback loop.How to do this nowHere’s a simple checklist that you can follow to put these ideas into action.Pick a target domain/task. Choose one area (e.g., math, coding, or a specific application) where you need better performance. This keeps the project focused.Collect a small seed dataset. Gather, say, a few thousand prompt–answer pairs in that domain from existing sources (textbooks, GitHub, etc.).Filter for edge-of-ability examples. Use a strong model (e.g., GPT-4) to create an answer key for each prompt. Run your base model on those prompts. Keep examples that the base model often misses, discard ones it already solves or is hopeless on. This yields “teachable” examples.Fine-tune your model (Phase 1). Run a short SFT job on this curated data. Track performance on a held-out set or benchmark. Iterate: Refine the data mix, remove easy questions, add new teachable ones, until gains taper off.Add synthetic examples if needed. If some concepts lack auto-verifiable answers (like long proofs), create simpler numeric or single-answer variants using your LLM. This gives clear rewards for RL. Keep a balance with real problems.Expand to the next domain. Once one domain is tuned, “freeze” its dataset. Pick a second high-value domain and repeat steps 3 to 5 to tune that data mix. Finally, merge the data for both domains, and do a final longer training run (Phase 2).Monitor benchmarks carefully. Use a consistent evaluation methodology (like majority-voting runs) to avoid misleading results. Only proceed to a full-scale training if small experiments show clear improvements.Limits and trade-offsDespite the effectiveness of the Phi-4 training method, several limitations and practical considerations remain. One key challenge is domain scaling. While Phi-4’s additive method worked well for math and code, it has yet to be proven across many domains. The authors acknowledge that it remains an open question whether this approach can scale smoothly to dozens of topics. Another concern is the use of synthetic data. Relying too heavily on synthetic rewrites can reduce the diversity of the dataset, so it’s crucial to maintain a balance between real and synthetic examples to preserve the model&#x27;s ability to reason effectively. Lastly, while the repeatable SFT method helps reduce computational costs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for thoughtful curation. Even though the approach is more efficient than brute-force scaling, it still requires careful data selection and iteration.Lessons from Phi-4The Phi-4 reasoning story is clear: Bigger isn’t always better for reasoning models. Instead of blindly scaling, the team asked where learning happens and engineered their data to hit that sweet spot. They show that “the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning extends to reasoning models.” In other words, with a smart curriculum, you can squeeze surprising capability out of modest models.For engineers, the takeaway is actionable. You don’t need a billion-dollar cluster or an endless internet crawl to improve reasoning. For resource-strapped teams, this is good news, as a careful data strategy lets you punch above your weight.Phi-4 reasoning proves that methodical data and training design, not sheer parameter count, drives advanced reasoning. Focusing on teachable data and iterative tuning, even a 14B model surpassed much larger rivals. For AI teams today, this offers a practical blueprint. Refine the data, iterate fast, and scale only when the signals are right. These steps can unlock breakthrough reasoning performance without breaking the bank.",

It turns out that the perimeter of △AMC is equal to the perimeter of △CNA, and the perimeter of △ANB is equal to the perimeter of △CMB. Prove that △ABC is isosceles.ABC is a triangle with AB=13 and BC=10. On the sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, points M and N are taken, respectively. It turns out that the perimeter of △AMC is equal to the perimeter of △CNA, and the perimeter of △ANB is equal to the perimeter of △CMB. What is AC?Table: Rewriting seed data from the web (left) into verifiable synthetic questions for SFT and RL (right). Source: MicrosoftNote that by assigning numeric values (AB=13, BC=10) and asking “What is AC?”, the answer becomes a single number, which can be easily checked for correctness.Other teams have applied similar domain-specific tricks. For example, chemistry LLMs like FutureHouse’s ether0 model generate molecules under strict pKa or structural constraints, using crafted reward functions to ensure valid chemistry. In mathematics, the Kimina-Prover model by Numina translates natural-language theorems into the Lean formal system, so reinforcement learning can verify correct proofs. These examples highlight how synthetic augmentation, when paired with verifiable constraints, can push models to perform well in highly specialized domains.In practical terms, engineers should embrace synthetic data but keep it grounded. Heuristics like “convert to numeric answers” or “decompose a proof into checkable steps” can make training safer and more efficient. At the same time, maintain a pipeline of real (organic) problems as well, to ensure breadth. The key is balance. Use synthetic transformations to unlock difficult verification problems, but don’t rely on them exclusively. Real-world diversity still matters. Following this approach, the model is guided toward a clearly defined, discrete objective.Here are some results on Phi-4 reasoning models:Practical implementation for enterprisesAI teams looking to apply Phi-4 reasoning’s insights can follow a series of concrete steps to implement the approach effectively.Identifying the model’s edgeDetect your model’s “edge” by identifying where the base LLM struggles. One way is to use its confidence or agreement scores. For example, generate several answers per prompt (using a tool like Hugging Face’s vLLM for fast sampling) and see where consensus breaks. Those prompts at the margin of confidence are your teachable examples. By focusing on these low-confidence questions rather than the questions it already gets right, you ensure each new example is worth learning.Isolating domains for targeted tuningTune one domain at a time rather than mixing all data genres upfront. Pick the highest-value domain for your app (math, code, legal, etc.) and craft a small SFT dataset for just that. Iterate on the mix (balancing difficulty, source types, etc.) until performance saturates on domain-specific benchmarks. Then freeze that mix and add the next domain. This modular tuning follows Phi-4 reasoning’s “additive” strategy. It avoids cross-talk since you preserve gains in domain A even as you improve domain B.Expanding with synthetic augmentationLeverage synthetic augmentation when gold-standard answers are scarce or unverifiable. For instance, if you need to teach a proof assistant but can’t autocheck proofs, transform them into arithmetic puzzles or shorter proofs that can be verified. Use your LLM to rewrite or generate these variants (Phi-4 used this to turn complex word problems into numeric ones). Synthetic augmentation also lets you expand data cheaply. Once you have a validated small set, you can “multiply” it by having the LLM generate paraphrases, variations, or intermediate reasoning steps.Scaling through a two-phase strategyUse a two-phase training strategy that begins with exploration followed by scaling. In Phase 1 (exploration), run short fine-tuning experiments on a focused dataset (e.g., one domain) with limited compute. Track a few key metrics (benchmarks or held-out tasks) each run. Rapidly iterate hyperparameters and data mixes. The Phi-4 paper demonstrates that this speeds up progress, as small experiments helped the team discover a robust recipe before scaling up. Only once you see consistent gains do you move to Phase 2 (scaling), where you combine your verified recipes across domains and train longer (in Phi-4’s case, ~16 billion tokens). Although this stage is more compute-intensive, the risk is significantly reduced by the prior experimentation.Monitor for trigger points such as a significant uplift on validation tasks or stable metric trends. When those appear, it’s time to scale. If not, refine the recipe more first. This disciplined two-phase loop saves resources and keeps the team agile.In practice, many teams at Hugging Face and elsewhere have followed similar advice. For example, while developing conversational model SmolLM2, the team noticed poor chat performance in Phase 1. They then generated ~500K synthetic multi-turn dialogues and re-trained, which “significantly improved both downstream performance and its overall ‘vibes,’” as one researcher reports. This represents a concrete win, achieved through a targeted synthetic data injection based on an initial feedback loop.How to do this nowHere’s a simple checklist that you can follow to put these ideas into action.Pick a target domain/task. Choose one area (e.g., math, coding, or a specific application) where you need better performance. This keeps the project focused.Collect a small seed dataset. Gather, say, a few thousand prompt–answer pairs in that domain from existing sources (textbooks, GitHub, etc.).Filter for edge-of-ability examples. Use a strong model (e.g., GPT-4) to create an answer key for each prompt. Run your base model on those prompts. Keep examples that the base model often misses, discard ones it already solves or is hopeless on. This yields “teachable” examples.Fine-tune your model (Phase 1). Run a short SFT job on this curated data. Track performance on a held-out set or benchmark. Iterate: Refine the data mix, remove easy questions, add new teachable ones, until gains taper off.Add synthetic examples if needed. If some concepts lack auto-verifiable answers (like long proofs), create simpler numeric or single-answer variants using your LLM. This gives clear rewards for RL. Keep a balance with real problems.Expand to the next domain. Once one domain is tuned, “freeze” its dataset. Pick a second high-value domain and repeat steps 3 to 5 to tune that data mix. Finally, merge the data for both domains, and do a final longer training run (Phase 2).Monitor benchmarks carefully. Use a consistent evaluation methodology (like majority-voting runs) to avoid misleading results. Only proceed to a full-scale training if small experiments show clear improvements.Limits and trade-offsDespite the effectiveness of the Phi-4 training method, several limitations and practical considerations remain. One key challenge is domain scaling. While Phi-4’s additive method worked well for math and code, it has yet to be proven across many domains. The authors acknowledge that it remains an open question whether this approach can scale smoothly to dozens of topics. Another concern is the use of synthetic data. Relying too heavily on synthetic rewrites can reduce the diversity of the dataset, so it’s crucial to maintain a balance between real and synthetic examples to preserve the model&#x27;s ability to reason effectively. Lastly, while the repeatable SFT method helps reduce computational costs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for thoughtful curation. Even though the approach is more efficient than brute-force scaling, it still requires careful data selection and iteration.Lessons from Phi-4The Phi-4 reasoning story is clear: Bigger isn’t always better for reasoning models. Instead of blindly scaling, the team asked where learning happens and engineered their data to hit that sweet spot. They show that “the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning extends to reasoning models.” In other words, with a smart curriculum, you can squeeze surprising capability out of modest models.For engineers, the takeaway is actionable. You don’t need a billion-dollar cluster or an endless internet crawl to improve reasoning. For resource-strapped teams, this is good news, as a careful data strategy lets you punch above your weight.Phi-4 reasoning proves that methodical data and training design, not sheer parameter count, drives advanced reasoning. Focusing on teachable data and iterative tuning, even a 14B model surpassed much larger rivals. For AI teams today, this offers a practical blueprint. Refine the data, iterate fast, and scale only when the signals are right. These steps can unlock breakthrough reasoning performance without breaking the bank.",

With adversaries achieving a breakout in as little as 51 seconds according to CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report, and 80% of security teams preferring GenAI integrated into a broader security platform, dismantling legacy walls isn&#x27;t just strategic, it&#x27;s existential. More than 70% of enterprises experienced at least one AI-related breach in the past year alone, with generative models now the primary target, according to recent SANS Institute findings.The latest industry data presents a troubling paradox, however. Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s AgentCompany benchmark shows that AI agents fail 70 to 90% of the time on complex enterprise tasks. Salesforce&#x27;s research confirms that its internal agent failure rate exceeds 90% when security guardrails are applied.

In the AI era, security comes down to three things: the quality of your data, the speed of your response, and the precision of your enforcement.\"Enterprise SOCs average 83 security tools across 29 different vendors, each generating isolated data streams that defy easy integration to the latest generation of AI systems. System fragmentation and lack of integration represent AI&#x27;s greatest vulnerability, and organizations&#x27; most fixable problem.The mathematics of tool sprawl proves devastating. Organizations deploying AI across fragmented toolsets report significantly elevated false-positive rates. This equates to about one in four alerts, with some teams facing more than 30% false alarms or more. The majority of enterprises, 74%, rely on multi-vendor cybersecurity ecosystems, with 43% citing lack of cross-platform integration as a significant operational burden.Dismantling governance gridlock with a single agent architecture Traditional security governance was built for and assumes human-speed operations composed of quarterly reviews, monthly audits, and daily approvals. AI agents operate at machine speed, making millions of decisions per second. This velocity mismatch creates a governance crisis that paralyzes AI adoption.Getting governance right is one of a CISO&#x27;s most formidable challenges and often includes removing longstanding roadblocks to make sure their organization can connect and make contributions across the business. CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, SentinelOne, Trellix, and others are taking on this challenge at the architectural level of their platforms.CISOs tell VentureBeat that excelling at governance is one of their most crucial tasks to get right. Having a centralized platform that consolidates all sources of telemetry, ideally in a single-agent model, is what&#x27;s needed. SOC teams need the latest telemetry data to complete real-time correlation, scaling detection, and response. CrowdStrike&#x27;s Falcon platform, for example, consolidates endpoint, cloud, identity, and threat intelligence streams into a unified telemetry pipeline, enabling SOC teams to make governance decisions at machine speed and precision. From a governance standpoint, this architecture unlocks several critical capabilities.Policy‑as‑code for AI agents: Guardrails (e.g., data residency rules, acceptable use, privileged action limits) can be encoded once and consistently enforced wherever agents operate, instead of being re-implemented per tool.Single source of truth for evidence and audit: Investigations, exception approvals, and AI-driven actions are all backed by the same telemetry and log fabric, simplifying regulatory reporting and reducing audit findings.Continuous control monitoring: Rather than sampling controls quarterly, the platform can continuously test whether identity, endpoint, and workload policies are actually effective in the live environment.Closed‑loop enforcement: Detected policy violations can automatically trigger compensating controls — from revoking tokens to isolating workloads — without waiting on human approval queues when risk thresholds are exceeded.Consistent identity-centric governance: Mapping activity to identities, not just devices or IPs, lets CISOs enforce least privilege, monitor insider risk, and constrain what AI agents can do on behalf of humans.These design goals equate to fewer agents to manage and patch, fewer conflicting policies, and fewer blind spots across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. For CISOs, that translates into something very concrete: a defensible narrative to the board and regulators that AI initiatives are not rogue automation, but are operating within a provable, monitored, and enforceable governance framework built on a coherent architecture rather than a tangle of tools.Transforming the culture of \"no\" forces CISOs to think strategically A CISO&#x27;s transformation from security gatekeeper to business enabler and strategist is the single best step any security professional can take in their career. CISOS often remark in interviews that the transition from being an app and data disciplinarian to an enabler of new growth with the ultimate goal of showing how their teams help drive revenue was the catalyst their careers needed.Andrew Obadiaru, CISO at Cobalt, captures the urgency: \"Nothing is particularly new, maybe AI is newer, and the pace at which it&#x27;s all going keeps increasing, but we need to do better at all of it in 2025.\"\"Tying my teams&#x27; performance to new revenue we enabled by thinking strategically is the single best decision I&#x27;ve made for my teams and my career,\" a CISO of a financial services firm told VentureBeat. Pritesh Parekh, CISO at PagerDuty, emphasizes that \"when security is done right, we&#x27;re actually accelerating the business by eliminating manual checkpoints and replacing them with automated guardrails.\" This approach directly enables the machine-speed governance that AI agents require, which is coincidentally the same governance architecture that CrowdStrike and others are building into their platforms.Organizations with unified security and IT operations tend to excel at governance while also reporting 30% fewer significant security incidents compared to those with siloed teams. When adversaries achieve a breakout in 51 seconds, cultural silos become attack vectors.The fix is straightforward. Integrate security teams into development and operations. Build automated guardrails, not manual checkpoints. Enable AI agents to securely tap into unified data streams for instant response while they are monitoring in real-time. This way, security stops being the department that slows everything down and becomes the intelligence that powers automated defense.",

The competition to keep developers working on their platforms, coming from tech companies, has also heated up.AWS thinks its offering, Kiro, and new capabilities to ensure behavioral adherence set up a large differentiator in the increasingly crowded coding agent space. Kiro, first launched in July on public preview, is now generally available with new features, including property-based testing for behavior and a command-line interface (CLI) capability to tailor custom agents. Kiro is an agentic coding tool with its own IDE to help create agents and applications from prototype to production.Deepak Singh, AWS vice president for developer agents and experiences, told VentureBeat that Kiro “keeps the fun” of coding while providing it structure.“The way I like to say it is, what Kiro does is it allows you to talk to your agent and work with your agent to build software just like you would do with any other agent,” Singh said. “But what Kiro does is it brings this structured way of writing that software, which we call spec-driven development, to specs that take your ideas, converts them into things that will endure over time. So the outcome is more robust, maintainable code.”In addition to new features, AWS is offering startups in most countries one year of free credits to Kiro Pro+ and expanded access to Teams. Behavioral adherence and checkpointing built inOne of the new features of Kiro is property-based testing and checkpointing. A problem some enterprises face with AI-generated code is that it can sometimes be difficult to judge accuracy and how closely the agents adhere to their intended purpose. AWS noted in a blog post that “whoever writes the tests (human or AI) is limited by their own biases — they have to think of all the different, specific scenarios to test the code against, and they’ll miss edge cases they didn’t think of. AI models often ‘game’ the solution by modifying tests instead of fixing code.”“What property-based testing does is it takes a specification, it takes a spec, and from that, it identifies properties your code should have, and it basically creates potentially hundreds of testing scenarios to verify that your code is doing what you intended it to as identified in the spec, and it does all the automatically,” Singh said. Singh said that organizations can upload their specifications, and the Kiro agent can start identifying what is missing, even before the code review process begins. Property-based testing matches the specified behavior, aka your instructions, to what the code is doing. Kiro can help users write it in their specifications based on the EARS format. For example, if a company is building a car sales app, the specification would read:“For any user and any car listing, WHEN the user adds the car to favorites, THE System SHALL display that car in their favorites list. PBT then automatically tests this with User A adding Car #1, User B adding Car #500, User C adding multiple cars, users with special characters in usernames, cars with various statuses (new, used, certified), and hundreds more combinations, catching edge cases and verifying that implementation matches your intent.”As opposed to a traditional unit test specification, which states: If a user adds car #5 to their favorites, then it will appear on their list.Kiro will then identify examples of the code violating the specifications and present them to the user. Kiro also now allows for checkpointing, so developers can go back to a previous change if something goes wrong. CLI codingThe second major new feature of Kiro is Kiro CLI, which brings the Kiro coding agent directly into a developer’s CLI.AWS said the Kiro CLI utilizes some functionalities from the Q Developer CLI—its in-line coding assistant, launched in October 2024—to enable users to access the agent from the command line. It also allows developers to start building custom agents, such as a backend specialist, a frontend agent, and a DevOps agent, tailored to an organization’s codebase.Singh said developers have their own unique ways of working, so it’s important for coding agent providers like AWS to meet them, where they are. Kiro CLI allows users to:Stay in the terminal without the need for context switchingStructuring AI workflows with custom agentsHave one set up for two environments since MCP servers and other tools work in both the Kiro version on the IDE or the CLIFast automation to format code or manage logs through automated commandsCoding agents competitionKiro, though, is just one of many coding agent platforms cropping up and competing for enterprise usage. From OpenAI’s GPT-Codex, which unifies its Codex coding assistant with IDEs, CLIs, and other workflows, to Google’s Gemini CLI, it&#x27;s clear that more developers demand easy access to coding agents where they do their work. And enterprises are demanding more from coding agents. For example, Anthropic made its Claude Code platform available on the web and mobile. Some coding platforms also allow users to choose which model to use for their coding. Singh said Kiro doesn’t rely on just one LLM; instead, it routes to the best model for the work, including AWS models. At launch in July, Kiro was based on Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0. The current iteration leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5. Well-known brands like Monday.com have noted the significant benefits of AI-powered coding, demonstrating that enterprises will likely continue to utilize these platforms in the future. “We saw that the mental model changes for developers, but it’s not just about becoming more efficient; it’s also how they organize around the way they work now,” Singh said.",

Kiro CLI allows users to:Stay in the terminal without the need for context switchingStructuring AI workflows with custom agentsHave one set up for two environments since MCP servers and other tools work in both the Kiro version on the IDE or the CLIFast automation to format code or manage logs through automated commandsCoding agents competitionKiro, though, is just one of many coding agent platforms cropping up and competing for enterprise usage. From OpenAI’s GPT-Codex, which unifies its Codex coding assistant with IDEs, CLIs, and other workflows, to Google’s Gemini CLI, it&#x27;s clear that more developers demand easy access to coding agents where they do their work. And enterprises are demanding more from coding agents. For example, Anthropic made its Claude Code platform available on the web and mobile. Some coding platforms also allow users to choose which model to use for their coding. Singh said Kiro doesn’t rely on just one LLM; instead, it routes to the best model for the work, including AWS models. At launch in July, Kiro was based on Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.0. The current iteration leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5. Well-known brands like Monday.com have noted the significant benefits of AI-powered coding, demonstrating that enterprises will likely continue to utilize these platforms in the future. “We saw that the mental model changes for developers, but it’s not just about becoming more efficient; it’s also how they organize around the way they work now,” Singh said.",

The 128GB Meta Quest 3S is 17 percent off in an early Black Friday deal, bringing it to a record-low price of $250. It normally goes for $300. With the purchase, you also get the game Gorilla Tag for free. There's also a 256GB option, which is on sale as well and comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow. That version costs $330, down from its usual price of $400. The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive VR headset for the price, and scored a 90 in Engadget's review, landing it among our picks for the best VR headsets around right now. It's comfortable to wear, gets over two hours of battery life before needing to be recharged and offers a 96-degree field of view. While its 1,830 by 1,920 pixel per eye screen doesn't quite achieve the sharpness of the Quest 3, it does have the same chip — the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 — as the pricier model, making for fast performance. It also comes with 8GB of RAM. The Quest 3S also comes with the Touch Plus controllers, which have button and joystick controls as well as motion controls. It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience.

          "title": "From shiny object to sober reality: The vector database story, two years later",
          "standfirst": "When I first wrote “Vector databases: Shiny object syndrome and the case of a missing unicorn” in March 2024, the industry was awash in hype. Vector databases were positioned as the next big thing — a must-have infrastructure layer for the gen AI era. Billions of venture dollars flowed, developers rushed to integrate embeddings into their pipelines and analysts breathlessly tracked funding rounds for Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus and a dozen others.The promise was intoxicating: Finally, a way to search by meaning rather than by brittle keywords. Just dump your enterprise knowledge into a vector store, connect an LLM and watch magic happen.Except the magic never fully materialized.Two years on, the reality check has arrived: 95% of organizations invested in gen AI initiatives are seeing zero measurable returns. And, many of the warnings I raised back then — about the limits of vectors, the crowded vendor landscape and the risks of treating vector databases as silver bullets — have played out almost exactly as predicted.Prediction 1: The missing unicornBack then, I questioned whether Pinecone — the poster child of the category — would achieve unicorn status or whether it would become the “missing unicorn” of the database world. Today, that question has been answered in the most telling way possible: Pinecone is reportedly exploring a sale, struggling to break out amid fierce competition and customer churn.Yes, Pinecone raised big rounds and signed marquee logos. But in practice, differentiation was thin. Open-source players like Milvus, Qdrant and Chroma undercut them on cost. Incumbents like Postgres (with pgVector) and Elasticsearch simply added vector support as a feature. And customers increasingly asked: “Why introduce a whole new database when my existing stack already does vectors well enough?”The result: Pinecone, once valued near a billion dollars, is now looking for a home. The missing unicorn indeed. In September 2025, Pinecone appointed Ash Ashutosh as CEO, with founder Edo Liberty moving to a chief scientist role. The timing is telling: The leadership change comes amid increasing pressure and questions over its long-term independence. Prediction 2: Vectors alone won’t cut itI also argued that vector databases by themselves were not an end solution. If your use case required exactness — l ike searching for “Error 221” in a manual—a pure vector search would gleefully serve up “Error 222” as “close enough.” Cute in a demo, catastrophic in production.That tension between similarity and relevance has proven fatal to the myth of vector databases as all-purpose engines. “Enterprises discovered the hard way that semantic ≠ correct.”Developers who gleefully swapped out lexical search for vectors quickly reintroduced… lexical search in conjunction with vectors. Teams that expected vectors to “just work” ended up bolting on metadata filtering, rerankers and hand-tuned rules. By 2025, the consensus is clear: Vectors are powerful, but only as part of a hybrid stack.Prediction 3: A crowded field becomes commoditizedThe explosion of vector database startups was never sustainable. Weaviate, Milvus (via Zilliz), Chroma, Vespa, Qdrant — each claimed subtle differentiators, but to most buyers they all did the same thing: store vectors and retrieve nearest neighbors.Today, very few of these players are breaking out. The market has fragmented, commoditized and in many ways been swallowed by incumbents. Vector search is now a checkbox feature in cloud data platforms, not a standalone moat.Just as I wrote then: Distinguishing one vector DB from another will pose an increasing challenge. That challenge has only grown harder. Vald, Marqo, LanceDB, PostgresSQL, MySQL HeatWave, Oracle 23c, Azure SQL, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, SingleStore, ElasticSearch, OpenSearch, Apahce Solr… the list goes on.The new reality: Hybrid and GraphRAGBut this isn’t just a story of decline — it’s a story of evolution. Out of the ashes of vector hype, new paradigms are emerging that combine the best of multiple approaches.Hybrid Search: Keyword + vector is now the default for serious applications. Companies learned that you need both precision and fuzziness, exactness and semantics. Tools like Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, pgVector and Pinecone’s own “cascading retrieval” embrace this.GraphRAG: The hottest buzzword of late 2024/2025 is GraphRAG — graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation. By marrying vectors with knowledge graphs, GraphRAG encodes the relationships between entities that embeddings alone flatten away. The payoff is dramatic.Benchmarks and evidenceAmazon’s AI blog cites benchmarks from Lettria, where hybrid GraphRAG boosted answer correctness from ~50% to 80%-plus in test datasets across finance, healthcare, industry, and law. The GraphRAG-Bench benchmark (released May 2025) provides a rigorous evaluation of GraphRAG vs. vanilla RAG across reasoning tasks, multi-hop queries and domain challenges. An OpenReview evaluation of RAG vs GraphRAG found that each approach has strengths depending on task — but hybrid combinations often perform best. FalkorDB’s blog reports that when schema precision matters (structured domains), GraphRAG can outperform vector retrieval by a factor of ~3.4x on certain benchmarks. The rise of GraphRAG underscores the larger point: Retrieval is not about any single shiny object. It’s about building retrieval systems — layered, hybrid, context-aware pipelines that give LLMs the right information, with the right precision, at the right time.What this means going forwardThe verdict is in: Vector databases were never the miracle. They were a step — an important one — in the evolution of search and retrieval. But they are not, and never were, the endgame.The winners in this space won’t be those who sell vectors as a standalone database. They will be the ones who embed vector search into broader ecosystems — integrating graphs, metadata, rules and context engineering into cohesive platforms.In other words: The unicorn isn’t the vector database. The unicorn is the retrieval stack.Looking ahead: What’s nextUnified data platforms will subsume vector + graph: Expect major DB and cloud vendors to offer integrated retrieval stacks (vector + graph + full-text) as built-in capabilities.“Retrieval engineering” will emerge as a distinct discipline: Just as MLOps matured, so too will practices around embedding tuning, hybrid ranking and graph construction.Meta-models learning to query better: Future LLMs may learn to orchestrate which retrieval method to use per query, dynamically adjusting weighting.Temporal and multimodal GraphRAG: Already, researchers are extending GraphRAG to be time-aware (T-GRAG) and multimodally unified (e.g. connecting images, text, video).Open benchmarks and abstraction layers: Tools like BenchmarkQED (for RAG benchmarking) and GraphRAG-Bench will push the community toward fairer, comparably measured systems.From shiny objects to essential infrastructureThe arc of the vector database story has followed a classic path: A pervasive hype cycle, followed by introspection, correction and maturation. In 2025, vector search is no longer the shiny object everyone pursues blindly — it’s now a critical building block within a more sophisticated, multi-pronged retrieval architecture.The original warnings were right. Pure vector-based hopes often crash on the shoals of precision, relational complexity and enterprise constraints. Yet the technology was never wasted: It forced the industry to rethink retrieval, blending semantic, lexical and relational strategies.If I were to write a sequel in 2027, I suspect it would frame vector databases not as unicorns, but as legacy infrastructure — foundational, but eclipsed by smarter orchestration layers, adaptive retrieval controllers and AI systems that dynamically choose which retrieval tool fits the query.As of now, the real battle is not vector vs keyword — it’s the indirection, blending and discipline in building retrieval pipelines that reliably ground gen AI in facts and domain knowledge. That’s the unicorn we should be chasing now.Amit Verma is head of engineering and AI Labs at Neuron7. Read more from our guest writers. Or, consider submitting a post of your own!

          "standfirst": "While there are lots of great Black Friday sales on cheaper devices, it's the big ticket items that really make a world of difference. Take Apple's 2024 Mac mini M4, which has dropped to $499 from $599 as part of early Black Friday deals. The 17 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $30 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

          "standfirst": "Whether you or someone on your gift list has trouble keeping track of their stuff, you can't go wrong by picking up an AirTag for assistance. For Black Friday, you can save on Apple's Bluetooth trackers — a four-pack is on sale for $65 right now, which is just about the lowest price we've seen. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.

The deal for new subscribers is just $49 for the first year, marked down from $98. The real value is in selecting Peacock Premium, which would normally run you $110 per year on its own. With the current discount on a Walmart+ subscription you are essentially getting half off on your streaming subscription for that year. Just about every major streaming service has raised its prices in the last year, including HBO Max, Disney+, Netflix, Apple TV and YouTube TV, so saving some money on one of them just might be worth the effort. Cord cutting is not nearly as affordable as it used to be, so finding a deal like this is pretty helpful. Walmart+ itself offers myriad additional benefits like early access to Black Friday deals, free shipping on orders over $35, discounts on gas, free online veterinary care and more. Earlier this year, Walmart+ subscribers got first dibs on the Nintendo Switch 2 at the retailer. You can also use that free shipping to take advantage of Walmart's drone delivery program in a handful of select cities.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-hack-can-get-you-one-year-of-peacock-for-49-before-black-friday-192739978.html?src=rss",

If you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code. There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.

But in the rush to automate, a critical component is being overlooked: Scalable security. We are building a workforce of digital employees without giving them a secure way to log in, access data and do their jobs without creating catastrophic risk.The fundamental problem is that traditional identity and access management (IAM) designed for humans breaks at agentic scale. Controls like static roles, long-lived passwords and one-time approvals are useless when non-human identities can outnumber human ones by 10 to one. To harness the power of agentic AI, identity must evolve from a simple login gatekeeper into the dynamic control plane for your entire AI operation.“The fastest path to responsible AI is to avoid real data. Use synthetic data to prove value, then earn the right to touch the real thing.” — Shawn Kanungo, keynote speaker and innovation strategist; bestselling author of The Bold OnesWhy your human-centric IAM is a sitting duckAgentic AI does not just use software; it behaves like a user. It authenticates to systems, assumes roles and calls APIs. If you treat these agents as mere features of an application, you invite invisible privilege creep and untraceable actions. A single over-permissioned agent can exfiltrate data or trigger erroneous business processes at machine speed, with no one the wiser until it is too late.The static nature of legacy IAM is the core vulnerability. You cannot pre-define a fixed role for an agent whose tasks and required data access might change daily. The only way to keep access decisions accurate is to move policy enforcement from a one-time grant to a continuous, runtime evaluation.Prove value before production dataKanungo’s guidance offers a practical on-ramp. Start with synthetic or masked datasets to validate agent workflows, scopes and guardrails. Once your policies, logs and break-glass paths hold up in this sandbox, you can graduate agents to real data with confidence and clear audit evidence.Building an identity-centric operating model for AISecuring this new workforce requires a shift in mindset. Each AI agent must be treated as a first-class citizen within your identity ecosystem.First, every agent needs a unique, verifiable identity. This is not just a technical ID; it must be linked to a human owner, a specific business use case and a software bill of materials (SBOM). The era of shared service accounts is over; they are the equivalent of giving a master key to a faceless crowd.Second, replace set-and-forget roles with session-based, risk-aware permissions. Access should be granted just in time, scoped to the immediate task and the minimum necessary dataset, then automatically revoked when the job is complete. Think of it as giving an agent a key to a single room for one meeting, not the master key to the entire building.Three pillars of a scalable agent security architectureContext-aware authorization at the core. Authorization can no longer be a simple yes or no at the door. It must be a continuous conversation. Systems should evaluate context in real time. Is the agent’s digital posture attested? Is it requesting data typical for its purpose? Is this access occurring during a normal operational window? This dynamic evaluation enables both security and speed.Purpose-bound data access at the edge. The final line of defense is the data layer itself. By embedding policy enforcement directly into the data query engine, you can enforce row-level and column-level security based on the agent’s declared purpose. A customer service agent should be automatically blocked from running a query that appears designed for financial analysis. Purpose binding ensures data is used as intended, not merely accessed by an authorized identity.Tamper-evident evidence by default. In a world of autonomous actions, auditability is non-negotiable. Every access decision, data query and API call should be immutably logged, capturing the who, what, where and why. Link logs so they are tamper evident and replayable for auditors or incident responders, providing a clear narrative of every agent’s activities.A practical roadmap to get startedBegin with an identity inventory. Catalog all non-human identities and service accounts. You will likely find sharing and over-provisioning. Begin issuing unique identities for each agent workload.Pilot a just-in-time access platform. Implement a tool that grants short-lived, scoped credentials for a specific project. This proves the concept and shows the operational benefits.Mandate short-lived credentials. Issue tokens that expire in minutes, not months. Seek out and remove static API keys and secrets from code and configuration.Stand up a synthetic data sandbox. Validate agent workflows, scopes, prompts and policies on synthetic or masked data first. Promote to real data only after controls, logs and egress policies pass.Conduct an agent incident tabletop drill. Practice responses to a leaked credential, a prompt injection or a tool escalation.

That’s now changing as he takes on the role of co-CEO of a new AI company, according to a New York Times report citing three people familiar with the company. Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are dubbed part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.” Bezos’ co-CEO will be Dr. Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.) Bajaj also worked at Verily, another Alphabet-backed research group focused on life sciences, and Foresite Labs, an incubator for new AI companies.Read full article Comments",

The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in an accompanying editor’s note. In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.Read full article Comments",

The ruling came in response to a suit filed by groups representing the faculty at these schools challenging the Trump administration’s attempts to force UCLA into a deal that would substantially revise instruction and policy. The court’s decision lays out how the Trump administration’s attacks on universities follow a standard plan: use accusations of antisemitism to justify an immediate cut to funding, then use the loss of money to compel an agreement that would result in revisions to how the university is run. The court finds that this plan was deficient on multiple grounds, from violating legal procedures for cutting funding to an illegal attempt and suppressing the First Amendment rights of faculty. The result is a reprieve for the entire University of California system, as well as a clear pathway for any universities to fight back against the Trump administration’s attacks on research and education.Read full article Comments",

The campaigns, which ramped up nearly five years ago, aim to steal millions of dollars in job revenue and cryptocurrencies to fund North Korean weapons programs. Another motive is to seed cyber attacks for espionage. In one such incident, a North Korean man who fraudulently obtained a job at US security company KnowBe4 installed malware immediately upon beginning his employment. On Friday, the US Justice Department said that five men pleaded guilty to assisting North Koreans in obtaining jobs in a scheme orchestrated by APT38, also tracked under the name Lazarus. APT38 has targeted the US and other countries for more than a decade with a stream of attack campaigns that have grown ever bolder and more advanced.

Long-suffering Mac Pro buyers may have taken heart when Apple finally added an M2 Ultra processor to the tower in mid-2023, making it one of the very last Macs to switch from Intel to Apple Silicon—surely this would mean that the computer would at least be updated once every year or two, like the Mac Studio has been? But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Mac Pro buyers shouldn’t get their hopes up for new hardware in 2026. Gurman says that the tower is “on the back burner” at Apple and that the company is “focused on a new Mac Studio” for the next-generation M5 Ultra chip that is in the works. As we reported earlier this year, Apple doesn’t have plans to design or release an M4 Ultra, and the Mac Studio refresh from this spring included an M3 Ultra alongside the M4 Max.Read full article Comments",

To get a sense of where the company goes from here, Ars spoke with the company’s chief executive, Dave Limp, on the eve of last week’s launch. The first thing he emphasized is how much the company learned about New Glenn, and the process of rolling the vehicle out and standing it up for launch, from the vehicle’s first attempt in January.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Nothing says it’s holiday season quite like a new installment of Rian Johnson’s delightful Knives Out mystery series. The final trailer for Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was just released, featuring Daniel Craig’s Benoit Blanc in all his Southern gentleman detective glory. This time, he’s tackling the strange death of a parish priest in a spookily Gothic small-town setting. As we’ve previously reported, the original Knives Out was a masterfully plotted winning mashup of Clue and Murder on the Orient Express—or any number of adaptations of novels by the grande dame of murder mysteries, Agatha Christie—along with other classics like Deathtrap, Gosford Park, and Murder by Death. Craig clearly found Blanc a refreshing counter to the 007 franchise, and he and Johnson soon committed to filming a sequel: 2022’s Glass Onion, inspired particularly by the Christie-based “tropical getaway” whodunnit Evil Under the Sun (1982) and an under-appreciated 1973 gem called The Last of Sheila. And now we have Wake Up Dead Man. With this franchise, the less one knows going in, the better. But Johnson has assembled yet another winning all-star cast. Josh Brolin plays the victim, the fire-and-brimstone-spewing Monseigneur Jefferson Wicks; Josh O’Connor plays a young priest named Rev. Jud Duplenticy; Glenn Close plays a devout churchgoer named Martha Delacroix, Wick’s loyal helper; Mila Kunis plays local police chief Geraldine Scott; Jeremy Renner plays town doctor Nat Sharp; Kerry Washington plays uptight lawyer Vera Draven; Daryl McCormack plays aspiring politician Cy Draven; Thomas Haden Church plays groundskeeper Samson Holt; Andrew Scott plays bestselling author Lee Ross; and Cailee Spaeny plays Simone Vivane, a disabled former classical cellist.Read full article Comments",

Now, though, the team behind that fan server effort is closing off new access after Sony started issuing DMCA takedown requests of sample gameplay videos. The Game Post was among the first to publicize the “Concord Delta” project, which reverse-engineered the game’s now-defunct server API to get a functional multiplayer match running over the weekend. “The project is still [a work in progress], it’s playable, but buggy,” developer Red posted in the game’s Discord channel, as reported by The Game Post. “Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting.” Accessing the “Concord Delta” servers reportedly requires a legitimate PC copy of the game, which is relatively hard to come by these days. Concord only sold an estimated 25,000 copies across PC and PS5 before being shut down last year. And that number doesn’t account for the players who accepted a full refund for their $40 purchase after the official servers shut down.Read full article Comments",

Engelmann, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Engelmann says that from the beginning of the Western intellectual tradition, people thought that only humans are rational. So, he designed a study to see if rationality shows up in chimpanzees. It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are. Food puzzles “There was quite a bit of research showing that chimpanzees can form their beliefs in response to evidence,” Engelmann says. The experiments usually involved chimpanzees deciding which of the two boxes contained a snack. When the researchers shook both boxes and there was a rattling sound coming from one of them, the chimps almost always chose the box where the rattling came from.Read full article Comments",

I am pretty sure this idea could work, and it’s because I’ve already been experimenting with what is essentially a “Steam Machine” underneath my own TV for months, starting in May when Valve began making it possible to install SteamOS on certain kinds of generic PC hardware. Depending on what it costs—and we can only guess what it will cost—the Steam Machine could be a good fit for people who just want to plug a more powerful version of the Steam Deck experience into their TVs. But for people who like tinkering or who, like me, have been messing with miniature TV-connecting gaming PCs for years and are simply tired of trying to make Windows workable, the future promised by the Steam Machine is already here.Read full article Comments",

And the Egyptians didn’t just indulge occasionally: according to a paper published in the Journal of Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology, opiate use may have been a fixture of daily life. In recent years, archaeologists have been applying the tools of pharmacology to excavated artifacts in collections around the world. As previously reported, there is ample evidence that humans in many cultures throughout history used various hallucinogenic substances in religious ceremonies or shamanic rituals. That includes not just ancient Egypt but also ancient Greek, Vedic, Maya, Inca, and Aztec cultures. The Urarina people who live in the Peruvian Amazon Basin still use a psychoactive brew called ayahuasca in their rituals, and Westerners seeking their own brand of enlightenment have also been known to participate. For instance, in 2023, David Tanasi, of the University of South Florida, posted a preprint on his preliminary analysis of a ceremonial mug decorated with the head of Bes, a popular deity believed to confer protection on households, especially mothers and children. After collecting sample residues from the vessel, Tanasi applied various techniques—including proteomic and genetic analyses and synchrotron radiation-based Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy—to characterize the residues.Read full article Comments",
