          "standfirst": "A cycle-accurate alternative to speculation — unifying scalar, vector and matrix computeFor more than half a century, computing has relied on the Von Neumann or Harvard model. Nearly every modern chip — CPUs, GPUs and even many specialized accelerators — derives from this design. Over time, new architectures like Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW), dataflow processors and GPUs were introduced to address specific performance bottlenecks, but none offered a comprehensive alternative to the paradigm itself. A new approach called Deterministic Execution challenges this status quo. Instead of dynamically guessing what instructions to run next, it schedules every operation with cycle-level precision, creating a predictable execution timeline. This enables a single processor to unify scalar, vector and matrix compute — handling both general-purpose and AI-intensive workloads without relying on separate accelerators.The end of guessworkIn dynamic execution, processors speculate about future instructions, dispatch work out of order and roll back when predictions are wrong. This adds complexity, wastes power and can expose security vulnerabilities. Deterministic Execution eliminates speculation entirely. Each instruction has a fixed time slot and resource allocation, ensuring it is issued at exactly the right cycle. The mechanism behind this is a time-resource matrix: A scheduling framework that orchestrates compute, memory and control resources across time. Much like a train timetable, scalar, vector and matrix operations move across a synchronized compute fabric without pipeline stalls or contention.Why it matters for enterprise AI Enterprise AI workloads are pushing existing architectures to their limits. GPUs deliver massive throughput but consume enormous power and struggle with memory bottlenecks. CPUs offer flexibility but lack the parallelism needed for modern inference and training. Multi-chip solutions often introduce latency, synchronization issues and software fragmentation. In large AI workloads, datasets often cannot fit into caches, and the processor must pull them directly from DRAM or HBM. Accesses can take hundreds of cycles, leaving functional units idle and burning energy. Traditional pipelines stall on every dependency, magnifying the performance gap between theoretical and delivered throughput. Deterministic Execution addresses these challenges in three important ways. First, it provides a unified architecture in which general-purpose processing and AI acceleration coexist on a single chip, eliminating the overhead of switching between units. Second, it delivers predictable performance through cycle-accurate execution, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as large langauge model (LLM) inference, fraud detection and industrial automation. Finally, it reduces power consumption and physical footprint by simplifying control logic, which in turn translates to a smaller die area and lower energy use. By predicting exactly when data will arrive — whether in 10 cycles or 200 — Deterministic Execution can slot dependent instructions into the right future cycle. This turns latency from a hazard into a schedulable event, keeping the execution units fully utilized and avoiding the massive thread and buffer overheads used by GPUs or custom VLIW chips. In modeled workloads, this unified design delivers sustained throughput on par with accelerator-class hardware while running general-purpose code, enabling a single processor to fulfill roles typically split between a CPU and a GPU. For LLM deployment teams, this means inference servers can be tuned with precise performance guarantees. For data infrastructure managers, it offers a single compute target that scales from edge devices to cloud racks without major software rewrites.Comparison of traditional Von Neumann architecture and unified deterministic execution. Image created by author.Key architectural innovations Deterministic Execution builds on several enabling techniques. The time-resource matrix orchestrates compute and memory resources in fixed time slots. Phantom registers allow pipelining beyond the limits of the physical register file. Vector data buffers and extended vector register sets make it possible to scale parallel processing for AI operations. Instruction replay buffers manage variable-latency events predictably, without relying on speculation. The architecture’s dual-banked register file doubles read/write capacity without the penalty of more ports. Direct queuing from DRAM into the vector load/store buffer halves memory accesses and removes the need for multi-megabyte SRAM buffers — cutting silicon area, cost and power. In modeled AI and DSP kernels, conventional designs issue a load, wait for it to return, then proceed — causing the entire pipeline to idle. Deterministic Execution pipelines loads and dependent computations in parallel, allowing the same loop to run without interruption, cutting both execution time and joules per operation. Together, these innovations create a compute engine that combines the flexibility of a CPU with the sustained throughput of an accelerator, without requiring two separate chips.Implications beyond AI While AI workloads are an obvious beneficiary, Deterministic Execution has broad implications for other domains. Safety-critical systems — such as those in automotive, aerospace and medical devices — can benefit from deterministic timing guarantees. Real-time analytics systems in finance and operations gain the ability to operate without jitter. Edge computing platforms, where every watt of power matters, can operate more efficiently. By eliminating guesswork and enforcing predictable timing, systems built on this approach become easier to verify, more secure and more energy-efficient.Enterprise impact For enterprises deploying AI at scale, architectural efficiency translates directly into competitive advantage. Predictable, latency-free execution simplifies capacity planning for LLM inference clusters, ensuring consistent response times even under peak loads. Lower power consumption and reduced silicon footprint cut operational expenses, especially in large data centers where cooling and energy costs dominate budgets. In edge environments, the ability to run diverse workloads on one chip reduces hardware SKUs, shortens deployment timelines and minimizes maintenance complexity.A path forward for enterprise computing The shift to Deterministic Execution is not merely about raw performance; it represents a return to architectural simplicity, where one chip can serve multiple roles without compromise. As AI permeates every sector, from manufacturing to cybersecurity, the ability to run diverse workloads predictably on a single architecture will be a strategic advantage. Enterprises evaluating infrastructure for the next five to 10 years should watch this development closely. Deterministic Execution has the potential to reduce hardware complexity, cut power costs and simplify software deployment — while enabling consistent performance across a wide range of applications.

A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only are these some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD, but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s — all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $60 (36 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $149 (38 percent off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is available at the lowest price we've seen all year. It's a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $156 (26 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $89 (23 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $148 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $220 (39 percent off): This SeaGate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-deals-include-discounts-on-gear-from-crucial-samsung-and-more-170039738.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, Anova sous vide machines, Breville appliances, KitchenAid gadgets and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $180 ($50 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Note the price was $20 lower for Prime members back in July. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-193009691.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, Anova sous vide machines, Breville appliances, KitchenAid gadgets and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time.

          "title": "The best October Prime Day TV deals: Early discounts on sets from Sony, Samsung, TCL and others",
          "standfirst": "It’s time for another October Prime Day sale, and that means Amazon is selling a number of well-regarded TVs for lower prices than usual. Not every deal is exclusive to the event, and it’s still more than possible that these sets drop even further as we get closer to Black Friday. For now, though, a few recommended sets from the likes of TCL, Hisense, Samsung and Sony are on sale. We’ve rounded up all the best October Prime Day TV deals we’ve seen thus far below, and we’ll update this post as more arise. Just note that you may need to be an Amazon Prime subscriber to access some of the discounts. Best Prime Day TV deals Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $1,082 ($416 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K with much better brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something that’s better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve tracked since July. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,498 ($100 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. (The S90F has a more colorful image, though.) We saw this 55-inch model go for $100 less earlier in the month, but this deal matches the best price we’ve tracked otherwise. The 65-inch version is similarly discounted. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,998 ($502 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. Outside of an extremely brief dip in June, this deal matches the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-tv-deals-early-discounts-on-sets-from-sony-samsung-tcl-and-others-180051602.html?src=rss",

Amongst the clothing, shoes, household essentials and other tech gear are some decent laptop deals that you can snag if you’re a Prime member — and even some that you can grab without a Prime subscription.But deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best October Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,078 (10 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Acer Aspire 3 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i3) for $400 (11 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $649 (28 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i7) for $800 (27 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

          "standfirst": "The Ring Battery Doorbell Plus is on sale for almost half off and is at the lowest price we've ever seen for this model. Normally retailing for $150, the smart doorbell is on sale for $80, a discount of 47 percent. This aggressive sale comes ahead of another Prime Day that runs October 7-8. The Battery Doorbell Plus offers a 150-by-150-degree \"head to toe\" field of vision and 1536p high-resolution video. This makes it a lot easier to see boxes dropped off at your front door since it doesn't cut off the bottom of the image like a lot of video doorbells. This model features motion detection, privacy zones, color night vision and Live View with two-way talk, among other features. Installation is a breeze since you don't have to hardwire it to your existing doorbell wiring. Most users report that the battery lasts between several weeks and several months depending on how users set up the video doorbell, with power-heavy features like motion detection consuming more battery life. With most video doorbells today, you need a subscription to get the most out of them, and Ring is no exception. Features like package alerts require a Ring Home plan, with tiers ranging from Basic for $5 per month to Premium for $20 per month. You'll also need a plan to store your video event history. Ring was acquired by Amazon in 2018, and now offers a full suite of home security products including outdoor cameras, home alarm systems and more. This deal is part of a larger sale on Ring and Blink devices leading up to Prime Day.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-this-battery-powered-ring-doorbell-while-its-47-percent-off-for-prime-day-154508948.html?src=rss",

The Battery Doorbell Plus offers a 150-by-150-degree \"head to toe\" field of vision and 1536p high-resolution video. This makes it a lot easier to see boxes dropped off at your front door since it doesn't cut off the bottom of the image like a lot of video doorbells. This model features motion detection, privacy zones, color night vision and Live View with two-way talk, among other features. Installation is a breeze since you don't have to hardwire it to your existing doorbell wiring. Most users report that the battery lasts between several weeks and several months depending on how users set up the video doorbell, with power-heavy features like motion detection consuming more battery life. With most video doorbells today, you need a subscription to get the most out of them, and Ring is no exception. Features like package alerts require a Ring Home plan, with tiers ranging from Basic for $5 per month to Premium for $20 per month. You'll also need a plan to store your video event history. Ring was acquired by Amazon in 2018, and now offers a full suite of home security products including outdoor cameras, home alarm systems and more. This deal is part of a larger sale on Ring and Blink devices leading up to Prime Day.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/pick-up-this-battery-powered-ring-doorbell-while-its-47-percent-off-for-prime-day-154508948.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums are more than just a gimmick. Sure, we all enjoy anthropomorphizing a Roomba from time to time, but they're not gadgets for the sake of gadgetry — keeping your living space clean is an incredibly rewarding task to automate. The only problem is that robot vacuums, and frankly all decent vacuums, are expensive. Fortunately, the steep discounts offered on Amazon this October Prime Day make the purchase a lot more justifiable, whether you want a robot buddy or a traditional vacuum cleaner. In this article, we're sharing a constantly updated list of vacuum discounts worth taking advantage of. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $410 (38 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $459 (29 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (55 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (36 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $55 (21 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-vacuum-deals-you-can-get-right-now-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504387.html?src=rss",

In a statement provided to multiple outlets like Insider Gaming, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed it has removed the discounts for DLC that come with a Game Pass subscription, replacing them by offering points for its Rewards program. While initial reports discovered the change with the Call of Duty franchise, the Microsoft statement later clarified that this major shift isn't \"specific to any one game and reflects all games and DLC purchases.\" To replace the discount, Ultimate subscribers will get 10 percent of their purchase back in Rewards points, while Premium members get five percent, when buying qualifying games from the Game Pass library. Earlier this month, Microsoft detailed in a post that its goal with Game Pass was to \"deliver unmatched value\" along with an expansive offering of included games. In the same post, Microsoft announced that it would add 45 more games, along with introducing the $10 price hike. With this latest move, Game Pass subscribers even lose out on the immediate 10 percent discount from their purchases and are forced to accept Game Pass store credit instead.

          "standfirst": "Prime Day sales are a great opportunity to nab an expensive bit of shiny new tech you’ve been eying — it’s also an excellent time to get a discount on smaller electronics and accessories. For this list, we compared what’s on sale right now with the stuff we recommend in our guides. For less than $50 each, we found deals on some of our favorite tech including batteries, iPhone paraphernalia, mice, earbuds, speakers, holiday gifts and smart home gear. Some deals require you to be a Prime member, others are open to anyone with half a Benjamin earmarked for Amazon. Here are the best October Prime Day tech deals under $50. Best Prime Day deals under $50 Amazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. It’s good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+. Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $35 ($14 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. Note that it dipped as low as $29 earlier this week. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Lego Star Wars: The Mandalorian Paz Vizsla and Moff Gideon Battle for $TK ($TK off): You can have a tiny version of the dramatic season-three battle from The Mandalorian to admire whenever you want. This 289-piece set is rated for kids seven and up, but no one will judge if you keep it for your own shelves. Check out more Lego sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $34 ($14 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $29 ($11 off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 ($30 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. JBL Go 4 portable speaker for $40 (20 percent off): The Go 4 is a handy little Bluetooth speaker that you can take anywhere you go thanks to its small, IP67-rated design and built-in carrying loop. It'll get seven hours of playtime on a single charge, and you can pair two together for stereo sound. The previous model, JBL Go 3 is on sale for $30. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 ($35 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $10 ($2 off): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-early-sales-on-tech-from-apple-anker-ring-jbl-roku-and-others-120531085.html?src=rss",

Roku Streaming Stick HD for $20 ($10 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 ($30 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. JBL Go 4 portable speaker for $40 (20 percent off): The Go 4 is a handy little Bluetooth speaker that you can take anywhere you go thanks to its small, IP67-rated design and built-in carrying loop. It'll get seven hours of playtime on a single charge, and you can pair two together for stereo sound. The previous model, JBL Go 3 is on sale for $30. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 ($35 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $10 ($2 off): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-early-sales-on-tech-from-apple-anker-ring-jbl-roku-and-others-120531085.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days are coming up, and you can get a jump on things today. A mainstay of Prime Day sales, a pair of Blink Mini 2 cameras is on sale for only $35. That's 50 percent off, a record low and less than what you'd usually pay for one. It's also Engadget's pick for the best budget security camera. This budget-friend, wired camera is well-suited for nighttime video: It has a built-in LED spotlight, color night vision and a low-light sensor. Day or night, it records in sharp 1080p resolution. It also has a wider field of view than its predecessor. The Blink Mini 2 is primarily designed for indoor use. But you can use it outdoors, too. You'll just need to fork over $10 for a weather-resistant adapter. Wherever you use the camera, it works with Alexa and supports two-way audio. (\"Hello, doggy, I'll be home soon.\") It also supports person detection. (That's a neat feature that differentiates between people and other types of movement.) However, the feature requires a Blink Subscription Plan. They start at $3 per month or $30 per year for one device. The camera is available in black or white. Both colors are available for the $35 Prime Day deal, but they can't be mixed unless you buy each separately. It's worth noting that this deal is open to anyone — no Prime subscription necessary. Amazon recently announced an upgraded version of this camera that supports 2K video, but it won't be available until later in October. You can also save on a bunch of other Blink (and Ring) security gear for Prime Day. The Blink Outdoor 4 cameras are some of our favorites, and most configurations are on sale for Prime Day, including bundles like this three-camera system that's 61 percent off.

          "standfirst": "You may not be looking to spend big on tech this October Prime Day, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it.For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has brought a handful of decent discounts on Apple devices, from iPads to Apple Watches to accessories like the Apple Pencil and AirTags. If you’ve been waiting to take the plunge and don’t want to hold out until Black Friday, here are the best Apple deals we could find from the Prime Big Deal Days event. We’ll update this post if we find anything new. As a refresher, the two-day sale officially runs October 7-8, and you’ll need to be a Prime member to view some of the deals. Best Prime Day Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal is just a few bucks below the best price we’ve seen for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Other configs with more memory are $200 off as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 512GB) for $1,199 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This is another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s only slightly higher than the all-time low for a model with 512GB of storage. Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad earned a score of 84 in our review: If you mainly want a tablet for streaming, browsing the web, emailing or lighter word processing, it should do the job. It doesn’t lose out on the Mac-style productivity features introduced with iPadOS 26 either. We’ve seen this discount on the 256GB model fairly often in recent months, and it’s about $25 above the device’s all-time low, but it’s still $50 cheaper than buying directly from Apple. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off): With its enormous finding network and ultra-wideband tech for accurately locating nearby items, Apple’s AirTag is the top pick for iPhone users in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers. We saw a four-pack fall as low as $65 earlier in the year, but this is still a nice drop from Apple’s list price. If you’re not in desperate need for these, though, note that we may see an updated model later this year. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches a couple weeks ago, but Amazon is selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since this is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile discount for a version of last year’s model with cellular support. Apple Watch SE (2nd gen, 40mm, GPS + Cellular) for $189 ($110 off): The Apple Watch SE 3 is a far more substantial upgrade over its predecessor than the Series 11, so we strongly recommend paying the premium to get the latest version. But if you’re sure you can live without the always-on display, faster charging, superior chip and other upgrades that come with the SE 3, the last-gen model can still get you most of the basic Apple Watch experience for less cash while it remains in stock. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for the 40mm cellular model.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-early-october-prime-day-deals-on-apple-devices-save-on-airtags-ipads-apple-watches-and-more-125644340.html?src=rss",

We’ll update this post if we find anything new. As a refresher, the two-day sale officially runs October 7-8, and you’ll need to be a Prime member to view some of the deals. Best Prime Day Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal is just a few bucks below the best price we’ve seen for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Other configs with more memory are $200 off as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 512GB) for $1,199 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This is another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s only slightly higher than the all-time low for a model with 512GB of storage. Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad earned a score of 84 in our review: If you mainly want a tablet for streaming, browsing the web, emailing or lighter word processing, it should do the job. It doesn’t lose out on the Mac-style productivity features introduced with iPadOS 26 either. We’ve seen this discount on the 256GB model fairly often in recent months, and it’s about $25 above the device’s all-time low, but it’s still $50 cheaper than buying directly from Apple. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off): With its enormous finding network and ultra-wideband tech for accurately locating nearby items, Apple’s AirTag is the top pick for iPhone users in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers. We saw a four-pack fall as low as $65 earlier in the year, but this is still a nice drop from Apple’s list price. If you’re not in desperate need for these, though, note that we may see an updated model later this year. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches a couple weeks ago, but Amazon is selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since this is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile discount for a version of last year’s model with cellular support. Apple Watch SE (2nd gen, 40mm, GPS + Cellular) for $189 ($110 off): The Apple Watch SE 3 is a far more substantial upgrade over its predecessor than the Series 11, so we strongly recommend paying the premium to get the latest version. But if you’re sure you can live without the always-on display, faster charging, superior chip and other upgrades that come with the SE 3, the last-gen model can still get you most of the basic Apple Watch experience for less cash while it remains in stock. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for the 40mm cellular model.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-early-october-prime-day-deals-on-apple-devices-save-on-airtags-ipads-apple-watches-and-more-125644340.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "On the heels of the iPhone 17 lineup being released a few weeks ago, you can pick up Apple's 25W MagSafe charger for a song. The two-meter version of the more powerful charging cable has dropped by 29 percent from $49 to $35. That's a record-low price. As it happens, that actually makes the two-meter version of the cable less expensive than the one-meter variant. The shorter cable will run you $39 as things stand. If you have an iPhone 16, iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, this cable can charge your device at 25W as long as it's connected to a 30W power adapter on the other end. While you'll need a more recent iPhone to get the fastest MagSafe charging speeds, the charger can wirelessly top up the battery of any iPhone from the last eight years (iPhone 8 and later). With older iPhones, the charging speed tops out at 15W. The cable works with AirPods wireless charging cases too — it's certified for Qi2.2 and Qi charging. The MagSafe charger is one of our favorite iPhone accessories, and would pair quite nicely with your new iPhone if you're picking up one of the latest models. If you're on the fence about that, be sure to check out our reviews of the iPhone 17, iPhone Pro/Pro Max and iPhone Air.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-25w-magsafe-charger-is-only-35-with-this-prime-day-deal-143415981.html?src=rss",

If you pay the $139 annual fee for Prime, sale events like these are a great time to stock up on essentials and cross things off your wishlist while you can save some money.Most discounts will be exclusively available to Prime subscribers, but there are always a few that anyone shopping on Amazon can grab. Similarly, there are always early deals in the days and weeks leading up to Prime Day, and this year is no different. Here, we’ve collected the best Prime Day deals you can shop for right now and we’ll keep updating this post as we get close to Prime Day proper. October Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $35 (29 percent off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $60 ($30 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but for now, you can get around that by stacking codes. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $38 (16 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. October Prime Day deals on tech Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): If you prefer desktops over laptops, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access. Apple Watch SE 2 for $189 (37 percent off): The SE 3 is the latest model as of September, but the SE 2 still has a lot going for it. It was our top pick for the best smartwatch for newbies (and those on a budget) because it gives you a solid core smartwatch experience at a great price. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 (42 percent off): These ultra-affordable wireless earbuds are 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the previous model, and they have a mobile app in which you can choose from three preset EQ modes to customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours, and they come with three different sizes of eartips so you can get the best fit. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 (15 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 (26 percent off, Prime exclusive): This small Bluetooth speaker gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $29 (27 percent off): Roku makes some of the best streaming devices available, and this small dongle gives you access to a ton of free content plus all the other streaming services you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Blink makes some of our favorite security cameras, and the Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring. It can be placed outside with the right weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. JBL Go 4 portable speaker for $40 (20 percent off): The Go 4 is a handy little Bluetooth speaker that you can take anywhere you go thanks to its small, IP67-rated design and built-in carrying loop. It'll get seven hours of playtime on a single charge, and you can pair two together for stereo sound. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E. It also has double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 (44 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design, improved speakers and added Alexa chops. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. Levoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $70 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Amazon Fire TV Cube for $100 (29 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming device, the Fire TV Cube supports 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision content, Dolby Atmos sound, Wi-Fi 6E and it has a built-in Ethernet port. It has the most internal storage of any Fire TV streaming device, plus it comes with an enhanced Alexa Voice Remote. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off): This entry-level robot vacuum is an upgraded version of one of our favorite budget robot vacuums. iRobot makes robovacs that are easy to use, even for those who have never had a machine like this, and they do a good job of cleaning up all kinds of messes, including pet hair. Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): If you're looking for an autonomous dirt-sucker that can also mop, this is a good option. It has a mopping pad and water reservoir built in, and it supports home mapping as well. Its self-emptying base can hold up to 60 days worth of debris, too. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-57-percent-off-gear-from-apple-shark-anker-dyson-samsung-and-others-050801311.html?src=rss",

          "title": "You can still get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $20 a month by buying pre-paid codes",
          "standfirst": "Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to $30 a month, but you may not have to pay that increased rate just yet. Online retailers are still selling codes for prepaid Game Pass subscriptions at the previous $20-per-month rate. Case in point: you can pay just $60 for three-month code from Amazon, stack your codes and keep your subscription without having to downgrade or cancel. As the highest tier in Game Pass, an Ultimate subscription gives you the ability to download and play a library of over 200 games on your PC or Xbox. With Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can also stream the majority of those games to other devices, too, whether it's a smartphone, LG TV or in-car display. It's worth noting, though, the benefits of Ultimate did change with the introduction of the higher price. Microsoft shared that Ultimate subscribers will now also receive the benefits of an Ubisoft+ subscription at no additional cost, a $16 a month value that unlocks access to a back catalog of Ubisoft games from franchises like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Starting in November, the new Ultimate subscription also includes access to Fortnite Crew, Epic's $12 a month plan that gives you V-Bucks, battle passes and more in Fortnite. While those new benefits might justify a higher price monetarily, whether that's a convincing reason to stay subscribed is a separate question. This likely won't be the last time Microsoft will raise the price of its subscription service. Avoiding those fees by buying pre-paid Game Pass codes seems like an excellent way to try out the new Ultimate before committing to cancelling your subscription, downgrading your plan or sticking with Microsoft's new price. You can purchase three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $60 a month. Stacking four three-month codes should come out to around $240.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/you-can-still-get-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-20-a-month-by-buying-pre-paid-codes-222333599.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to $30 a month, but you may not have to pay that increased rate just yet. Online retailers are still selling codes for prepaid Game Pass subscriptions at the previous $20-per-month rate. Case in point: you can pay just $60 for three-month code from Amazon, stack your codes and keep your subscription without having to downgrade or cancel. As the highest tier in Game Pass, an Ultimate subscription gives you the ability to download and play a library of over 200 games on your PC or Xbox. With Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can also stream the majority of those games to other devices, too, whether it's a smartphone, LG TV or in-car display. It's worth noting, though, the benefits of Ultimate did change with the introduction of the higher price. Microsoft shared that Ultimate subscribers will now also receive the benefits of an Ubisoft+ subscription at no additional cost, a $16 a month value that unlocks access to a back catalog of Ubisoft games from franchises like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Starting in November, the new Ultimate subscription also includes access to Fortnite Crew, Epic's $12 a month plan that gives you V-Bucks, battle passes and more in Fortnite.

          "standfirst": "If you prefer some variety in your review roundups, we cover quite the gamut this time. The headliner is the new Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, but we’ve recently tested a powerful gaming laptop, two action cameras and a wireless mouse (yep, still need those). Catch up on all the reviews we’ve published over the last two weeks by scrolling down below. Ray-Ban Meta While the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses may look similar to the original model, a lot has changed in terms of features. There are also two big upgrades over the last version: battery life and video quality. “The Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a lot of features that didn't exist when I first reviewed them two years ago, largely thanks to AI,” senior editor Karissa Bell said. “And with the release of its second-generation frames, there's still a lot to look forward to, like new camera features and AI-powered audio.” Alienware 16 Area-51 If you’re in the market for a powerful gaming laptop with a unique design, the Alienware 16 Area-51 might be for you. Of course, you’ll have to live with a machine that ‘s big and heavy — and also expensive. “Even though the Alienware 16 Area-51 might not be as portable as some of its rivals, it's got a lot to offer,” senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford wrote. “There’s a striking design, a nice screen (though more options would be nice), tons of ports and class-leading performance with plenty of configurability so you can dial in its specs exactly how you like.” GoPro Max 2 GoPro’s new product this fall wasn’t another Hero action camera. Instead, the company opted to take the 360 route, debuting the Max 2 for spherical videos. “With a mix of pro features like Timecode, GP-Log (with LUTs) alongside mobile-focused editing, GoPro clearly hopes the Max 2 will appeal to demanding and casual users alike,” contributor James Trew observed. “The company has also focused heavily on improving the user experience rather than going for pure technological advances and after a week or so of testing, that feels like a sensible move.” DJI Osmo Nano In case you missed it, tiny action cameras with detachable displays are a thing now. DJI’s first attempt at one of these products takes direct aim at Insta360’s duo of Go models. And despite better video quality than the competition, there’s still work to be done for the Osmo Nano. “With the Nano, DJI leaned on its camera experience and mostly matches or beats its main rival in terms of video quality,” reporter Steve Dent said. “However, the company is still lagging behind in a few areas, particularly its editing app — something that’s important for many creators.” Logitech MX Master 4 Three years after releasing the MX Master 3S, Logitech is back with another update to its productivity mouse. Shopping for the new version isn’t exactly a straightforward endeavor though. “The MX Master 4 may not be a essential upgrade if you’re happy with an older MX Master mouse, and if those didn’t work for you before, this one probably won’t work for you now,” senior buying advice reporter Jeff Dunn wrote. “But if you’re a power user in the market for a new productivity mouse, we’d expect this newest iteration to be as popular as its predecessors.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-ray-ban-meta-gopro-max-2-and-more-130000492.html?src=rss",

          "title": "How to clear the cache on your PS5",
          "standfirst": "If your PlayStation 5 has started feeling sluggish, freezes mid-game or acts a little weird, clearing the cache might be the quick fix you need. The cache is where your console stores temporary files to keep things running smoothly, but sometimes those files pile up and cause more problems than they solve. Clearing your PS5 cache won’t delete your games, saves or settings, but it can clear out the junk data that’s slowing things down. Whether you’re troubleshooting crashes or just want to keep your console running at its best, wiping the cache is one of the simplest steps you can take. How to start your PS5 in Safe Mode In order to clear your PS5 cache, you’ll need to start your console in Safe Mode. Similar to a PC, entering Safe Mode on a PS5 gives you access to basic functions on your console, including restarting your PS5, changing video output, repairing console storage, updating system software, restoring default settings, clearing the cache and rebuilding the database, resetting the PS5 and resetting the PS5 by reinstalling System Software. Unfortunately, there isn’t an option on your PS5 to enter Safe Mode via the Settings, but you can (safely) enter this mode by following these steps: Hold the PS button on your controller, then select Power > Turn off PS5. Alternatively, you can hold the power button on the PS5 for three seconds. Wait for the console to turn off; the power indicator will blink for a few moments before fully turning off. Press and hold the power button on the console, then release after you hear the second beep (this should take around seven seconds). Connect the controller with a USB cable, then press the PS button on the controller. It’s important to note that although you can turn off your PS5 with the controller, you must turn the console on using the power button on the PS5, using the steps above, to enter Safe Mode. How to clear the cache on a PS5 in Safe Mode Once in Safe Mode, you’ll see several options appear on the screen. Select Clear Cache and Rebuild Database, then Clear System Software Cache. Once you’ve selected the Clear System Software Cache option, you’ll need to confirm your choice by selecting OK. Your PS5 will begin the process of clearing the cache. If your console restarts during this process, don’t worry; let it do its thing. The other option you'll see in the Clear Cache and Rebuild Database menu is Rebuild Database. This option is also recommended by Sony is users are experiencing system failure issues. Selecting this option will not delete any data from your PS5, so it's another route to try if clearing the cache doesn't solve all your problems. How to back up PS5 data to a USB drive Although clearing the cache on a PS5 won’t result in saved game progress or data being deleted, it’s not a bad idea to know how to back up your data, just in case your PS5 encounters any issues. If you want to be extra safe, do this before clearing your cache. Connect a USB drive to your PS5 (FAT32 or exFAT). Navigate to Settings > System. Select System Software > Back Up and Restore > Back Up Your PS5. You’ll have the option to select the type of data you want to back up (Games and Apps, Saved Data, Screenshots and Video Clips or Settings). Select the option(s) you want to back up. Select Next > Back Up. This will start the back up process, where your console will restart. Once the Backup Complete screen is displayed, select OK. Why should you clear the cache on your PS5? Like a lot of technology, maintenance is required to keep your tech running top-notch, and the PS5 is no different. You won’t need to clear your PS5 cache often, but when things start going wrong, it can save you a lot of frustration. The cache is where the console stashes temporary system data. Most of the time it helps your games and apps load faster, but once in a while those files can get corrupted or outdated and cause trouble instead. One of the most common signs is lag in the system menu. If it takes forever to scroll through your library or even open Settings, a clogged cache might be to blame. It can also show up as random crashes, where a game boots up and then kicks you straight back to the home screen for no reason. You might also notice glitches with online play. Sometimes cached network data interferes with your connection, leaving you with login issues or games that won’t sync properly. After a major system update, clearing the cache can also help smooth over odd behavior, like apps failing to launch or downloads stalling. The good news is clearing the cache doesn’t wipe your saves, your installed games, or your account. It’s a low-risk way to rule out the simple stuff before you start digging into bigger fixes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-clear-the-cache-on-your-ps5-120012999.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. A bunch of new games arrived this week, alongside demo drops, reveals and details about upcoming titles. But if there are some you've had on your wishlist for a while and have been waiting for a solid discount, now might be the time to take the plunge.That's because Steam's autumn sale is underway. It's arguably not as massive as the summer or winter editions, but there are still lots of bargains on the storefront. During the platform's big sales, I think it's always worth taking a look at the list of deep discounts for some particularly good deals. I've been meaning to check out Haven from Cairn developer The Game Bakers for quite a while now, and at 90 percent off, that's an easy pickup for me. There are lots of solid offers elsewhere in the sale, including half off Tunic, Cult of the Lamb and Nine Sols; 35 percent off Turbo Kid; 40 percent off Another Crab's Treasure; and 25 percent off Animal Well and Blue Prince. Lots of blockbuster games are on sale too, of course, including the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2 (75 percent off), Returnal (50 percent off), Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered (50 percent off) and Assassin's Creed Shadows (40 percent off).Elsewhere, I thought this news nugget was pretty interesting. Evil Empire, the studio behind The Rogue Prince of Persia, has taken over development of Brotato. Original developer Blobfish Games is moving onto other projects.Brotato never hooked me as much as the similar Vampire Survivors did, but the game has more than 10 million players. Evil Empire is releasing an update for Brotato this month that brings a new mob to the game, but the studio's track record is what makes this change most intriguing. It handled several updates and expansions for Dead Cells, including the Return to Castlevania DLC. So, there could be some pretty neat stuff on the way to Brotato in the coming months and years, especially with Evil Empire teasing DLC.New releasesTwo Lego games arriving in the space of a couple of weeks might seem like a lot, but the latest one is a world away from Lego Voyagers. Lego Party — from SMG Studio and publisher Fictions — is a party game for up to four players and it has dozens of minigames. Think Mario Party, but blockier and with the smooth trademark humor of Lego games.It supports local and online cross-platform multiplayer and there are tons of different ways to customize your minifigure. Let's just hope no one gets too mad if you mess up their turn. Lego Party is out now on Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One is now available for the first time outside of virtual reality platforms thanks to the new Evolved Edition. It hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store this week. This is a first-person shooter from Survios that's set between Alien and Aliens. The game pits a marine colonel against hundreds of Xenomorphs and other nasty things. I can't imagine I would have kept my cool if I were playing this in VR and a Facehugger jumped onto my head, but the flatscreen version might not be so scary. Maybe.Puzzle adventure game Éalú sees you taking control of a wooden, clockwork mouse that's attempting to escape from a labyrinth. Designer Ivan Owen of Beyond the Bark created all of the stop-motion animations by hand, including all possible outcomes for each scenario, and did so mostly in a garden shed. It looks charming, though the mouse faces some rather grisly-sounding fates if you're not careful. Éalú is out now on Steam.Upcoming An edition of the PC Gaming Show took place during Tokyo Game Show last weekend, and it featured more than 30 games. One of them was Kaiju Cleanup. This is a cleaning sim in which you'll clean up kaiju carcasses by slicing up the monsters into smaller pieces, disposing of \"various jellies\" and powerwashing the last little bits away. If your character dies due to acidic fluids or explosive organs, just send in a clone and clean up that mess too. It's dangerous work, but someone's gotta do it. This is a fun idea. There's no release window for Kaiju Cleanup as yet, but Brightrock Games and publisher Mythwright say you can expect it to hit Steam at some point in the next 15 years. I kind of love the ethos of Wolf Haus Games. \"We make the games we wanted to play when we were 13, because now we're grown ups and nobody can tell us what to do,\" the studio says on its website. After collectively accruing decades of experience in AAA games and movies, the team is working on its first game, Join Us.In this co-op survival RPG, you'll set up a chapter of a doomsday cult. You can choose the belief system and recruit members for your cause while amassing a stockpile of weapons. Naturally, you'll need to build a compound for your collective and manage your resources. You can put your followers to work by assigning them roles like farmer, doctor and mission support, which will hopefully help you avoid permadeath.Join Us is coming to Steam in 2026. I already feel like I might stick with this one for longer than I did Valheim, one of the more prominent co-op survival games of the last few years. That's largely because this one has buses with machine gun turrets, along with pigs and bears you can ride into battle.Earth Must Die is another game that was unveiled at the latest PC Gaming Show. This is a point-and-click adventure from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots that has an appealing, cartoon-y art style, but it's the cast that really catches the eye here. It features performances from the likes of Joel Fry (Game of Thrones, Our Flag Means Death), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades 2) and a host of people who have appeared on the brilliant comedy panel show Taskmaster, including series creator Alex Horne. Earth Must Die is slated to hit Steam later this year.Speaking of Taskmaster, a game called Task Time seems like it was inspired by the show. This is a competitive party title from ReadGraves and publisher Wired Productions in which you'll compete with up to seven other players to complete random tasks. There are more than 500,000 variants of tasks that you might be asked to take on. It looks chaotic in a good way, and appear to tap into the DNA of the likes of Fall Guys (which shouldn't be surprising given that some of the dev team has experience of working on that game). There's local and online multiplayer support for this one. Task Time is coming to Steam and Epic Games Store \"soon.\" If you're quick, you can join the Steam playtest, which ends on Sunday.Rising Heat reminds me a little of Minishoot Adventures, a lovely Zelda-esque RPG from last year (40 percent off in the Steam sale, by the way). The only things they actually seem to have in common, though, is that you play as a little ship and they each have a top-down perspective.That's because Rising Heat is a twin-stick, bullet-hell survival roguelike. I dig the explosive, colorful visual effects (is that a black hole I see?) and the co-op mode sounds compelling. You can play with a friend locally or online, and your ships are tethered by a beam that can damage enemies and possibly pull your partner into danger if you're not careful. Rising Heat was supposed to arrive on October 14, but Fuzzy Sock Studios and publisher Apogee Entertainment have delayed it until December 2. However, you can try out a demo on Steam now.Here's another demo, and I'm very excited about this one. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the latest side-scrolling beat-'em-up from Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu, the teams behind the terrific Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. Although this game is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well later this year, the demo is currently only available on Steam. It features nine of the game's 15 playable heroes: Spider-Man, Wolverine, She-Hulk, Storm, Venom, Nova, Phyla-Vell, Rocket Raccoon and Captain America. You can pick two and switch between them any time to deliver powerful team-up attacks. There's couch and online co-op available, and the demo is fully playable on Steam Deck. I definitely need to carve out some time for this over the weekend. Ghost of Yōtei can wait a bit longer.Dogpile is another in a long line of Suika Game clones (where you combine two objects to make a larger one without spilling over the top of a container). This is all about smushing together very good dogs, so it's automatically one of the best ones. It has an utterly perfect title too.Dogpile switches up the format a bit since it's a deckbuilder and you can customize the puppers with their own traits. Dog tags alter how the pooches and their traits work, and using them smartly can help you discover synergies. Studio Folly and Toot Games are the developers behind Dogpile, and they have audio design assistance from A Shell in the Pit and help from the co-publishing team at Wings. There's no release window as yet. But there's a demo out on Steam right now and I don't know why you're still reading this instead of rushing off to play it immediately.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lego-parties-hundreds-of-xenomorphs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000144.html?src=rss",

It hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store this week. This is a first-person shooter from Survios that's set between Alien and Aliens. The game pits a marine colonel against hundreds of Xenomorphs and other nasty things. I can't imagine I would have kept my cool if I were playing this in VR and a Facehugger jumped onto my head, but the flatscreen version might not be so scary. Maybe.Puzzle adventure game Éalú sees you taking control of a wooden, clockwork mouse that's attempting to escape from a labyrinth. Designer Ivan Owen of Beyond the Bark created all of the stop-motion animations by hand, including all possible outcomes for each scenario, and did so mostly in a garden shed. It looks charming, though the mouse faces some rather grisly-sounding fates if you're not careful. Éalú is out now on Steam.Upcoming An edition of the PC Gaming Show took place during Tokyo Game Show last weekend, and it featured more than 30 games. One of them was Kaiju Cleanup. This is a cleaning sim in which you'll clean up kaiju carcasses by slicing up the monsters into smaller pieces, disposing of \"various jellies\" and powerwashing the last little bits away. If your character dies due to acidic fluids or explosive organs, just send in a clone and clean up that mess too. It's dangerous work, but someone's gotta do it. This is a fun idea. There's no release window for Kaiju Cleanup as yet, but Brightrock Games and publisher Mythwright say you can expect it to hit Steam at some point in the next 15 years. I kind of love the ethos of Wolf Haus Games. \"We make the games we wanted to play when we were 13, because now we're grown ups and nobody can tell us what to do,\" the studio says on its website. After collectively accruing decades of experience in AAA games and movies, the team is working on its first game, Join Us.In this co-op survival RPG, you'll set up a chapter of a doomsday cult. You can choose the belief system and recruit members for your cause while amassing a stockpile of weapons. Naturally, you'll need to build a compound for your collective and manage your resources. You can put your followers to work by assigning them roles like farmer, doctor and mission support, which will hopefully help you avoid permadeath.Join Us is coming to Steam in 2026. I already feel like I might stick with this one for longer than I did Valheim, one of the more prominent co-op survival games of the last few years. That's largely because this one has buses with machine gun turrets, along with pigs and bears you can ride into battle.Earth Must Die is another game that was unveiled at the latest PC Gaming Show. This is a point-and-click adventure from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots that has an appealing, cartoon-y art style, but it's the cast that really catches the eye here. It features performances from the likes of Joel Fry (Game of Thrones, Our Flag Means Death), Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades 2) and a host of people who have appeared on the brilliant comedy panel show Taskmaster, including series creator Alex Horne. Earth Must Die is slated to hit Steam later this year.Speaking of Taskmaster, a game called Task Time seems like it was inspired by the show. This is a competitive party title from ReadGraves and publisher Wired Productions in which you'll compete with up to seven other players to complete random tasks. There are more than 500,000 variants of tasks that you might be asked to take on. It looks chaotic in a good way, and appear to tap into the DNA of the likes of Fall Guys (which shouldn't be surprising given that some of the dev team has experience of working on that game). There's local and online multiplayer support for this one. Task Time is coming to Steam and Epic Games Store \"soon.\" If you're quick, you can join the Steam playtest, which ends on Sunday.Rising Heat reminds me a little of Minishoot Adventures, a lovely Zelda-esque RPG from last year (40 percent off in the Steam sale, by the way). The only things they actually seem to have in common, though, is that you play as a little ship and they each have a top-down perspective.That's because Rising Heat is a twin-stick, bullet-hell survival roguelike. I dig the explosive, colorful visual effects (is that a black hole I see?) and the co-op mode sounds compelling. You can play with a friend locally or online, and your ships are tethered by a beam that can damage enemies and possibly pull your partner into danger if you're not careful. Rising Heat was supposed to arrive on October 14, but Fuzzy Sock Studios and publisher Apogee Entertainment have delayed it until December 2. However, you can try out a demo on Steam now.Here's another demo, and I'm very excited about this one. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the latest side-scrolling beat-'em-up from Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu, the teams behind the terrific Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. Although this game is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well later this year, the demo is currently only available on Steam. It features nine of the game's 15 playable heroes: Spider-Man, Wolverine, She-Hulk, Storm, Venom, Nova, Phyla-Vell, Rocket Raccoon and Captain America. You can pick two and switch between them any time to deliver powerful team-up attacks. There's couch and online co-op available, and the demo is fully playable on Steam Deck. I definitely need to carve out some time for this over the weekend. Ghost of Yōtei can wait a bit longer.Dogpile is another in a long line of Suika Game clones (where you combine two objects to make a larger one without spilling over the top of a container). This is all about smushing together very good dogs, so it's automatically one of the best ones. It has an utterly perfect title too.Dogpile switches up the format a bit since it's a deckbuilder and you can customize the puppers with their own traits. Dog tags alter how the pooches and their traits work, and using them smartly can help you discover synergies. Studio Folly and Toot Games are the developers behind Dogpile, and they have audio design assistance from A Shell in the Pit and help from the co-publishing team at Wings. There's no release window as yet. But there's a demo out on Steam right now and I don't know why you're still reading this instead of rushing off to play it immediately.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/lego-parties-hundreds-of-xenomorphs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000144.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Huawei's new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware",
          "standfirst": "Huawei’s Computing Systems Lab in Zurich has introduced a new open-source quantization method for large language models (LLMs) aimed at reducing memory demands without sacrificing output quality. The technique, called SINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization), is designed to be fast, calibration-free, and easy to integrate into existing model workflows. The code for performing it has been made available by the Huawei research team on Github and Hugging Face under a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, allowing organizations to take and use it, modify it, and deploy it commercially — all for free.Across models of different sizes, SINQ cuts memory usage by 60–70%, depending on architecture and bit-width. This enables models that would previously require >60 GB of memory to run on ~20 GB setups—a critical enabler for running large models on a single high-end GPU or even multi-GPU consumer-grade setups.This makes it possible to run models that previously needed high-end enterprise GPUs—like NVIDIA’s A100 or H100—on significantly more affordable hardware, such as a single Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 (around $1600), instead of enterprise hardware like the A100 80GB ($19,000) or even H100 units that exceed $30,000.For teams using cloud infrastructure, the savings are similarly tangible. A100-based instances often cost $3–4.50 per hour, while 24 GB GPUs like the RTX 4090 are available on many platforms for $1–1.50 per hour. Over time, especially for extended inference workloads, this difference can add up to thousands of dollars in cost reductions, while also unlocking LLM deployment on smaller clusters, local workstations, or consumer-grade setups previously constrained by memory.Tackling the Memory Challenge of LLMsRunning large models often requires compromises between performance and size. In practice, neural networks use floating-point numbers to represent both weights and activations. A floating-point number can express a wide range of values (very small, very large, with fractional parts).This flexibility is helpful because during training and inference, weights and activations can vary in scale dramatically. Using floating-point lets the model adjust precisely. (For example, a weight could be 0.0023 or 123.45, and floating-point can capture both with decent precision.)Quantization — a method that reduces the precision of model weights — offers a practical path to lower memory usage, but typically comes with trade-offs in model quality, especially at 4-bit precision and below.When you convert those floating-point values into lower-precision formats (like 8-bit integers), you’re approximating them. That means you store and compute with fewer bits, which is faster and more memory-efficient — but you risk losing fidelity (i.e. introducing small errors). The trick is to do the conversion carefully so the model’s behavior stays nearly the same, even though internally it’s working with rougher approximations of those weights and activations.SINQ addresses these pain points by introducing a plug-and-play solution that delivers strong performance even in low-precision settings—without requiring calibration data or inter-layer dependencies.How SINQ WorksThe SINQ approach introduces two main innovations:Dual-Axis Scaling: Instead of using a single scale factor for quantizing a matrix, SINQ uses separate scaling vectors for rows and columns. This helps mitigate the effects of outliers and allows the quantization error to be distributed more flexibly across the matrix.Sinkhorn-Knopp-Style Normalization: A fast algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn iterations is used to normalize the standard deviations of rows and columns in a matrix. This helps minimize what the authors call “matrix imbalance,” a new proxy metric shown to be more effective than alternatives like kurtosis for improving quantization performance.The combination of these two features allows SINQ to outperform other calibration-free techniques such as Round-To-Nearest (RTN), HQQ, and Hadamard-based quantization across multiple benchmarks.Performance and CompatibilitySINQ has been evaluated across a wide range of architectures and models, including the Qwen3 series, LLaMA, and DeepSeek. On benchmarks like WikiText2 and C4, SINQ consistently reduces perplexity and flip rates compared to baseline methods, often approaching or matching the performance of calibrated solutions.It also supports non-uniform quantization schemes such as NF4 and can be combined with calibration methods like AWQ, leading to the variant A-SINQ. In calibrated settings, A-SINQ further narrows the gap with full-precision models.In terms of runtime efficiency, SINQ quantizes models roughly twice as fast as HQQ and over 30 times faster than AWQ. This makes it well-suited for both research and production environments where quantization time is a practical constraint.Open Source and Easy to UseHuawei has released SINQ as an open-source project under a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, with implementation instructions and reproducibility tools available on GitHub:The repository includes support for quantizing Hugging Face models with just a few lines of code, as well as tools for saving and reloading quantized weights. Default settings offer a balance between memory savings and accuracy, and users can customize parameters like bit-width, tiling strategy, and group size based on their needs.The authors also provide evaluation integration via the lm-eval library and plan to release pre-quantized models on the Hugging Face Hub in the near future.Looking AheadWith growing demand for running large models on consumer-grade hardware, quantization is becoming an essential tool. SINQ aims to lower the entry barrier for LLM deployment, enabling developers and researchers to efficiently shrink models without major trade-offs in quality or compatibility.Further updates—including integration with Hugging Face Transformers and pre-quantized model releases—are planned, making this a project to watch in the quantization space.",

          "standfirst": "The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is on sale for just $29. That's a discount of 27 percent and the lowest we've ever seen it. Roku has held the top spot in the TV OS market for years thanks to its user-friendly interface, an affordable range of streaming devices and its own lineup of TVs. We picked the Streaming Stick Plus as the best streaming device for free and live content, thanks in large part to The Roku Channel app that accompanies it. The Roku Channel features over 500 free TV channels with live news, sports coverage and a rotating lineup of TV shows and movies. In our hands-on review of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, we thought it was perfect for travel thanks to its small size and the fact that it can be powered by your TV's USB port, nixing the need for a wall adapter. Menu navigation and opening or closing apps won't happen at quite the same speeds as more expensive streamers, but it's quick enough for what is ultimately a pretty low-cost option. The Wi-Fi range on this one is also weaker than Roku's pricier devices, but unless you are placing it exceedingly far from your router, it shouldn't be an issue. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus supports both HD and 4K TVs, as well as HDR10+ content. It doesn't support Dolby Vision, however; for that you'll need to upgrade to Roku's Streaming Stick 4K or Roku Ultra. It comes with Roku's rechargeable voice remote with push-to-talk voice controls. Roku's remote can also turn on your TV and adjust the volume while you're watching. If you've been thinking about getting a Roku device, or you already love the platform and want a compact and convenient way to take it with you when you travel, then this sale provides a great opportunity. If you'd prefer a more powerful and slightly more stationary device, the Roku Ultra is on sale for $79 right now, too.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI will host more than 1,500 developers at its largest annual conference on Monday, as the company behind ChatGPT seeks to maintain its edge in an increasingly competitive artificial intelligence landscape.The third annual DevDay conference at San Francisco&#x27;s Fort Mason represents a critical moment for OpenAI, which has seen its dominance challenged by rapid advances from Google&#x27;s Gemini, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, and Meta&#x27;s growing AI efforts. The event comes just days after OpenAI&#x27;s new Sora video generation app topped Apple&#x27;s App Store, demonstrating the company&#x27;s ability to capture mainstream attention even as technical competitors close the gap.Chief Executive Sam Altman will deliver the opening keynote at 10 a.m. Pacific time, promising \"announcements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.\" The session will be livestreamed, but subsequent presentations — including a developer-focused \"State of the Union\" with President Greg Brockman and a closing conversation between Altman and Apple design legend Jony Ive — will only be available to in-person attendees.Google and Meta challenge ChatGPT&#x27;s developer dominanceThe conference arrives at a pivotal moment for OpenAI. While the company&#x27;s ChatGPT remains the most recognizable AI brand globally, technical evaluations show Google&#x27;s latest Gemini models performing competitively on coding tasks, while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude has gained traction among developers for its safety features and reasoning capabilities.This intensifying competition has fundamentally altered OpenAI&#x27;s strategic calculus. The company that once commanded premium pricing for access to its models now finds itself in a price war, releasing more capable systems at lower costs to retain developer loyalty.The shift reflects a maturing market where technical performance differences between leading AI models have narrowed considerably, forcing companies to compete on price, developer experience, and specialized capabilities rather than raw model superiority.The timing of DevDay also follows several strategic moves by OpenAI that signal broader ambitions beyond its core chatbot business. The company recently launched Sora 2, its advanced video generation model, alongside a social media application that allows users to create and share AI-generated videos. Industry observers speculate that Monday&#x27;s event could feature the long-rumored ChatGPT browser, potentially challenging Google Chrome&#x27;s dominance.Enterprise AI adoption takes center stage as revenue strategy shiftsThis year&#x27;s agenda reflects OpenAI&#x27;s growing focus on enterprise customers, who provide more predictable revenue streams than consumer subscriptions. Sessions will cover \"orchestrating agents at scale,\" enterprise AI adoption challenges, and how OpenAI applies its own technology to internal workflows across sales, support, and finance.The enterprise emphasis marks a shift from earlier DevDay events. The inaugural 2023 conference introduced GPT-4 Turbo and the GPT Store marketplace, while 2024&#x27;s more subdued gathering focused primarily on developer API improvements. This year&#x27;s expanded format suggests OpenAI views the developer community as crucial to its competitive positioning.The State of the Union presentation is expected to focus on how artificial intelligence is transforming software development workflows, with anticipated demonstrations of enhanced capabilities in OpenAI&#x27;s Codex programming assistant and the introduction of new open model offerings that could expand developer access to the company&#x27;s technology.Sora cinema and interactive AI demos showcase next-generation capabilitiesBeyond formal presentations, DevDay will feature hands-on demonstrations of emerging technologies. A \"Sora Cinema\" will showcase AI-generated short films, while custom arcade games built using GPT-5 — OpenAI&#x27;s latest model — will demonstrate the technology&#x27;s creative applications.Perhaps most intriguingly, attendees can interact with a \"living portrait\" of computer science pioneer Alan Turing that responds to questions, representing the kind of interactive AI experiences that could define the next generation of human-computer interaction.The presence of Jony Ive at the closing session carries particular significance. The former Apple executive has been collaborating with OpenAI on a consumer AI device, suggesting Monday&#x27;s conversation could provide insights into the company&#x27;s hardware ambitions.Developer ecosystem and market positioning face unprecedented competitive pressureFor enterprise technology decision-makers, DevDay represents more than a product showcase — it&#x27;s a window into how AI will reshape software development and business processes. The conference agenda includes sessions on context engineering, agent orchestration, and enterprise scaling challenges that reflect real-world implementation hurdles.The developer ecosystem around OpenAI&#x27;s APIs has become a critical competitive moat. Companies like Cursor, Clay, and Decagon have built substantial businesses on OpenAI&#x27;s foundation models, creating network effects that make switching to alternative providers more difficult.However, this ecosystem faces new challenges as competitors offer compelling alternatives. Google&#x27;s recent improvements to Gemini for coding tasks and Meta&#x27;s investments in its Superintelligence Labs represent serious threats to OpenAI&#x27;s developer mindshare.As the AI industry matures beyond initial breakthroughs, Monday&#x27;s DevDay will test whether OpenAI can maintain its leadership position through superior tooling, developer experience, and enterprise-focused innovation. With over $500 billion in market valuation riding on continued growth, the stakes for this year&#x27;s conference extend far beyond San Francisco&#x27;s shores.The keynote begins at 10 a.m. Pacific time and will be available via livestream on OpenAI&#x27;s YouTube channel.",

The former Apple executive has been collaborating with OpenAI on a consumer AI device, suggesting Monday&#x27;s conversation could provide insights into the company&#x27;s hardware ambitions.Developer ecosystem and market positioning face unprecedented competitive pressureFor enterprise technology decision-makers, DevDay represents more than a product showcase — it&#x27;s a window into how AI will reshape software development and business processes. The conference agenda includes sessions on context engineering, agent orchestration, and enterprise scaling challenges that reflect real-world implementation hurdles.The developer ecosystem around OpenAI&#x27;s APIs has become a critical competitive moat. Companies like Cursor, Clay, and Decagon have built substantial businesses on OpenAI&#x27;s foundation models, creating network effects that make switching to alternative providers more difficult.However, this ecosystem faces new challenges as competitors offer compelling alternatives. Google&#x27;s recent improvements to Gemini for coding tasks and Meta&#x27;s investments in its Superintelligence Labs represent serious threats to OpenAI&#x27;s developer mindshare.As the AI industry matures beyond initial breakthroughs, Monday&#x27;s DevDay will test whether OpenAI can maintain its leadership position through superior tooling, developer experience, and enterprise-focused innovation. With over $500 billion in market valuation riding on continued growth, the stakes for this year&#x27;s conference extend far beyond San Francisco&#x27;s shores.The keynote begins at 10 a.m. Pacific time and will be available via livestream on OpenAI&#x27;s YouTube channel.",

          "title": "Nissan Leaf 2026 review: Still the budget EV to beat",
          "standfirst": "\"Ohhh, this is niiice.\" I kept repeating that to myself when I first saw the 2026 Nissan Leaf in person, like the oft-memed Tiffany Haddish clip. I quickly learned it's hard not to love this third iteration of the Leaf. Its seats feel wonderfully comfortable, its infotainment screens are wide and immersive and its electromagnetic sunroof seemed like something meant for a far more premium car. I tested the highest-end Leaf, which retails for $38,990, but it still offers plenty of value at that price. And it makes me think the entry-level $30,000 model — which has smaller screens, cheaper seats and no sunroof — would be similarly great. Once again, the Nissan Leaf holds the crown as the ideal cheap EV. It's easy to forget what a revolutionary vehicle Nissan's original Leaf was. Released in 2010 for under $33,000, it was the first truly affordable EV on the market. Sure it was small and didn't go very far, but Nissan eventually fixed those issues with the second-gen model (which I ended up buying earlier this year). But that came at a time when the world was more hyped to see Tesla enter the fray with cheaper cars like the Model 3 and Model Y, and the Leaf was once again overshadowed when other automakers joined the EV arena. Now the Leaf is back and better than ever. Its compact SUV styling makes it look more futuristic than the basic hatchback design of the previous model, it can get up to 300 miles of range (up from a maximum of 212 miles with the earlier Leaf SV Plus) and it offers more cargo space with the rear seats down (55.5 cubic feet compared to 30 cubic feet). And with the Leaf's new turquoise color option, it truly stands out on the road. While it didn't turn as many heads during my testing as the VW id.Buzz, several neighbors commented that it simply looks cool. On a fundamental level, the 2026 Nissan Leaf shouts \"hot new EV\" in ways the old one simply didn't. Its sloped roofline and unique side profile makes it simultaneously seem like a sporty coupe and a tiny SUV. Its front and rear LED lights give off sci-fi vibes. Those same neighbors who were intrigued by this Leaf didn't even realize I had a 2018 model parked right beside it. They just thought that was a boring old hatchback. Since its inception, the Nissan Leaf's design has gone from a quirky curiosity to a car that was desperately aiming for the mainstream. This time around, Nissan's design choices feel supremely confident. Stepping into the Leaf makes that all the more clear: I loved its soft synthetic leather seats, which perfectly supported my aching back once I tweaked the lumbar support settings. Its enormous dual 14.3-inch infotainment screens also make a striking impression. The first screen, situated behind the steering wheel, makes it easy to see your current speed, charge level and additional driving information. But it's the center screen that takes the cake — it's gloriously colorful and bright enough to be visible in harsh sunlight. It's perfect for the Leaf's built-in Google Maps navigation, but it's even better when using wireless CarPlay, since every app fills the entire screen. (And thankfully, wireless CarPlay and Android Auto support are available on every Leaf trim.) The base 2026 Leaf has cloth seats and two 12.3-inch screens, but from photos I've seen they still look like a step up from most infotainment setups. My review model also had a 10-speaker \"Bose Personal Plus\" audio system, which includes small speakers inside the headrests of the driver and passenger seats. That makes music sound a bit more immersive, but more importantly, it also serves as a covert way to deliver navigation instructions to the driver without distracting everyone else in the car. During my testing, I found that the Bose system felt rich and detailed for most music (it has a small subwoofer, so anything bass-heavy sounded muddled), and I genuinely appreciated having directions whispered into my ears. Here the sunroof is partially shaded. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget The Leaf's panoramic sunroof, which is only available on the high-end Platinum+ FWD trim, also makes a striking impression. It lets in tons of light while blocking the heat of the sun, and it can also become opaque at the touch of a button with so-called Polymer Dispersed Crystal Display technology. You can also have it shade only part of the car, which is helpful when I'd like some light, but my kids in the back seat don't. The shaded mode still lets in diffuse light, but it's not powerful enough to cast shadows (it acts almost like a total solar filter, allowing you to see the sun safely). It doesn't darken the Leaf much, though, so you might need an additional shade for napping babies. According to Christian Spencer, a Nissan senior manager and engineer, the company found that the sunroof's shading technology also allowed for more headroom. Adding a traditional retracting shade would have shaved off a few much-needed inches. As it stands, the Leaf's wide and round roof should easily fit very tall drivers and passengers. In a conversation with Engadget, Spencer noted that Nissan also brought over some design elements from existing vehicles, like the Z sports car, Rogue SUV and Ariya EV. In particular, the new Leaf's sturdy 4-link suspension comes directly from the Ariya, and it helps to make the car feel much more stable over bumps and at high speeds. This is one of two charging ports on the 2026 Leaf. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget That's something I definitely noticed during a recent 100-mile round trip. The Leaf is zippy to get to highway speed thanks to its 214-horsepower electric motor (up from 147hp on the previous gen, but matching the same performance of the previous higher-end SV Plus models). The revamped Leaf also feels very solid while cruising alongside much larger cars and in chaotic winds, whereas the previous model always felt a bit unstable at high speeds. The overall rigidity leads to slightly mushy steering on the 2026 Leaf, but I still found it more comfortable to drive than Kia's similarly-sized EV6. My wife and kids, who care less about driving dynamics, noted that it just felt very smooth to ride in. My 100-mile trip brought the leaf down to 60 percent from a full charge, which is in line with the 259 miles of range available on my Platinum+ review model. (Curiously, you lose range as you step up the Leaf’s specs. I’m sure the large 19-inch tires didn’t help with efficiency — the cheaper models have 18-inch tires.) I was able to charge the Leaf from 65 percent to 100 percent overnight with a standard Level 1 charger. In addition to the standard J1772 port for Level 1 and 2 charging at home, the Leaf also includes a Tesla-style (NACS, above) port for high-speed refills at Tesla Superchargers. That makes the 2026 Leaf far more suitable for road trips than the older model, which was stuck with an archaic CHAdeMO port for fast charging. The nissan Leaf 2018 (left) next to the 2026 model (right). Devindra Hardawar for Engadget A major difference I noticed from my 2018 Leaf is that the new model actually feels like a true electric car internally, rather than being built out of a frame that was originally designed for a gas-powered vehicle. The annoying center console from the second-gen Leaf — which was made out of cheap plastic, and led to so much knee banging I had to install a cushion — is completely gone, replaced with room for a small backpack or purse by your right foot. The new Leaf's floor also sits very low, which gives second-row passengers a ton of leg room. Not every change is a true step forward, though. While the 2026 Leaf offers more overall cargo space than the previous version, it loses 3.6 cubic feet of storage when the rear seats are up. And if you've got kids in car seats, those rear chairs will always be up. I was able to fit in a small tricycle, two scooters, protective gear and a small cooler during a recent trip, but it was definitely a tight squeeze. On a brighter note, I was at least able to fit in a large combination car seat and smaller booster chair without issue. I also really appreciated Nissan's easily accessible LATCH connections, which are brightly colored and easily visible. You don't have to go fishing around for them under cushions like on other cars. Here you can see a Doona tricycle, two scooters and a cooler. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget There's also bad news for fans of one pedal driving: Nissan has dumped its original \"E-pedal\" feature for \"E-step,\" which can dramatically slow the Leaf with regenerative braking, but won't fully stop the car. According to Spencer, that's partially due to Japanese regulators, who prefer having the brake be the only way to fully stop a car. But it's a bummer if you've gotten used to the convenience of one-pedal driving and never touching the brakes, a feature that Nissan helped to pioneer with the second-gen Leaf. Spencer says the company has heard plenty of feedback about the loss of true one pedal driving though, so it could be a feature Nissan implements again down the line. I’d consider those complaints minor quibbles, though. The 2026 Leaf is more attractive and feature-rich than the $34,000 Hyundai Kona EV or Chevy Equinox, and it also has the backing of a company with far more experience in the EV arena. While I’d still recommend looking at used EV options — I’ve seen great cars like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 dip to $25,000 or less — the 2026 Leaf is simply hard to beat.

          "title": "Why do AI data centers use so many resources?",
          "standfirst": "With the AI boom, construction of new data centers has skyrocketed, and not without consequence — some communities that count these facilities as neighbors are now facing water shortages and strained power supplies. While tech's data center footprint has been growing for decades, generative AI has seemingly shifted the impacts of these operations toward the catastrophic. What exactly makes these new data centers such a burden on the environment and existing infrastructure, and is there anything we can do to fix it? ChipsThe industry believes AI will work its way into every corner of our lives, and so needs to build sufficient capacity to address that anticipated demand. But the hardware used to make AI work is so much more resource-intensive than standard cloud computing facilities that it requires a dramatic shift in how data centers are engineered. Typically the most important part of a computer is its “brain,” the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It's designed to compute a wide variety of tasks, tackling them one at a time. Imagine a CPU as a one-lane motorway in which every vehicle, no matter the size, can get from A to B at extraordinary speed. What AI relies on instead are Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which are clusters of smaller, more specialized processors all running in parallel. In the example, a GPU is a thousand-lane motorway with a speed limit of just 30 mph. Both try to get a huge number of figurative vehicles to their destination in a short amount of time, but they take diametrically opposite approaches to solving that problem. Phil Burr is Head of Product at Lumai, a British company looking to replace traditional GPUs with optical processors. “In AI, you repeatedly perform similar operations,” he explained, “and you can do that in parallel across the data set.” This gives GPUs an advantage over CPUs in large but fundamentally repetitive tasks, like graphics, executing AI models and crypto mining. “You can process a large amount of data very quickly, but it’s doing the same amount of processing each time,” he said.In the same way that thousand-lane highway would be pretty wasteful, the more powerful GPUs get, the more energy hungry they become. “In the past, as [CPUs evolved] you could get a lot more transistors on a device, but the overall power [consumption] remained about the same,\" Burr said. They're also equipped with “specialized units that do [specific] work faster so the chip can return to idle sooner.” By comparison, “every iteration of a GPU has more and more transistors, but the power jumps up every time because getting gains from those processes is hard.” Not only are they physically larger — which results in higher power demands — but they “generally activate all of the processing units at once,” Burr said. In 2024, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a congressionally mandated report into the energy consumption of data centers. The report identified a sharp increase in the amount of electricity data centers consumed as GPUs became more prevalent. Power use from 2014 to 2016 was stable at around 60 TWh, but started climbing in 2018, to 76 TWh, and leaping to 176 TWh by 2023. In just five years, data center energy use more than doubled from 1.9 percent of the US’ total, to nearly 4.4 percent — with that figure projected to reach up to 12 percent by the start of the 2030s.HeatLike a lightbulb filament, as electricity moves through the silicon of computer chips, it encounters resistance, generating heat. Extending that power efficiency metaphor from earlier, CPUs are closer to modern LEDs here, while GPUs, like old incandescent bulbs, lose a huge amount of their power to resistance. The newest generation of AI data centers are filled with rack after rack of them, depending on the owner’s needs and budget, each one kicking out what Burr described as “a massive amount of heat.” Heat isn’t just an unwelcome byproduct: if chips aren’t kept cool, they'll experience performance and longevity issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) publishes guidelines for data center operators. It advocates server rooms should be kept between 18 to 27 degrees celsius (64.4 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Given the sheer volume of heat GPUs kick out, maintaining that temperature requires some intensive engineering, and a lot of energy.The majority of data centers use a handful of methods to keep their hardware within the optimal temperature. One of the oldest ways to maximize the efficiency of air conditioning is a technique of hot and cold aisle containment. Essentially, cold air is pushed through the server racks to keep them cool, while the hot air those servers expel is drawn out to be cooled and recirculated. Many data centers, especially in the US, rely on the cooling effect that occurs as water changes from a liquid to a gas. This is done by drawing hot air through a wet medium to facilitate evaporation and blowing the resulting cooled air into the server room, in a method known as direct evaporative cooling. There's also indirect evaporative cooling, which works similarly but adds a heat exchanger — a device that's used to transfer heat between different mediums. In this type of setup, the heat from the warm air is transferred and cooled separately from the server room to avoid raising the humidity levels indoors. Due in part to their cooling needs, data centers have a tremendous water footprint. The Lawrence Berkeley report found that, in 2014, US-based data centers consumed 21.2 billion liters of water. By 2018, however, that figure had leapt to 66 billion liters, much of which was attributed to what it collectively terms “hyperscale” facilities, which include AI-focused operations. In 2023, traditional US data centers reportedly consumed 10.56 billion liters of water while AI facilities used around 55.4 billion liters. The report’s projections believe that by 2028, AI data centers will likely consume as much as 124 billion liters of water. \"Collectively, data centers are among the top-ten water consuming industrial or commercial industries in the US,\" according to a 2021 study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. About one-fifth of these data centers use water from stressed watersheds, i.e. areas where the demand for water may be greater than the natural supply. Most of the water consumed by data centers evaporates and won't be immediately replenished, while the rest goes to wastewater treatment plants. As a trio of academics explained in an op-ed for The Dallas Morning News, data centers are \"effectively removing [drinking water] from the local water cycle.\" Water used in the cooling process is typically treated with chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors and biocides, which prevent bacterial growth. The resulting wastewater often contains pollutants, so it can't be recycled for human consumption or agriculture. And data centers' water use goes well beyond cooling. A much bigger portion of their water footprint can be attributed to indirect uses, mainly through electricity generated by power plants but also through wastewater utilities. These account for about three-fourths of a data center's water footprint, the study notes. Power plants use water in a number of ways, primarily for cooling and to produce the steam needed to spin their electricity-generating turbines. According to the authors, 1 megawatt-hour of energy consumed by data centers in the US on average requires 7.1 cubic meters of water. \"Data centers are indirectly dependent on water from every state in the contiguous US, much of which is sourced from power plants drawing water from subbasins in the eastern and western coastal states,\" the authors explain. To adequately address the water issue, energy consumption must be reigned in too. Exploring the alternativesOne major approach to reduce the massive water footprint of these systems is to use closed-loop liquid cooling. This is already ubiquitous on a smaller scale in high-end PCs, where heat-generating components, such as the CPU and GPU, have large heat exchangers that a liquid is pumped through. The liquid draws away the heat, and then has to be cooled down via another heat exchanger, or a refrigeration unit, before being recirculated. Liquid cooling is becoming more and more common, especially in AI data centers, given the heat that GPUs generate. With the exception of mechanical issues, like leaking, and the water needed to operate the facility more generally, closed-loop systems do not experience water loss and so make more reasonable demands on local water resources. Direct-to-chip liquid cooling drastically cuts a data center's potential water use, and more efficiently removes heat than traditional air-cooling systems. In recent years, companies including Google, NVIDIA and Microsoft have been championing liquid cooling systems as a more sustainable way forward. And researchers are looking into ways to employ this approach on an even more granular level to tackle the heat right at the source. Whereas cold plates (metal slabs with tubing or internal channels for coolant to flow through) are commonly used in liquid cooling systems to transfer heat away from the electronics, Microsoft has been testing a microfluidics-based cooling system in which liquid coolant travels through tiny channels on the back of the chip itself. In the lab, this system performed \"up to three times better than cold plates at removing heat,\" and the company said it \"can effectively cool a server running core services for a simulated Teams meeting.\" A blog post about the findings noted, \"microfluidics also reduced the maximum temperature rise of the silicon inside a GPU by 65 percent, though this will vary by the type of chip.\"Another option is \"free\" cooling, or making use of the natural environmental conditions at the data center site to cool the operation. Air-based free cooling utilizes the outdoor air in cold locales, while water-based free cooling relies on cold water sources such as seawater. Some facilities couple this with rainwater harvesting for their other water needs, like humidification.A map of Start CampusStart CampusStart Campus, a data center project in Portugal, is located on the site of an old coal-fired power station and will use much of its old infrastructure. Rather than simply employ a closed-loop, the high temperatures will require the closed-loop system to interact with an open loop. When the campus is fully operational, its heat will be passed onto around 1.4 million cubic tons of seawater per day. Omer Wilson, CMO at Start Campus, said that by the time the water has returned to its source, its temperature will be the same as the surrounding sea. Start Campus has also pledged that there will be no meaningful water loss from this process.There is another novel cooling method, immersion, in which computing equipment is — you guessed it — immersed in a non-conductive liquid suitable to draw heat. Wilson described it as a relatively niche approach, used in some crypto mining applications, but not used by industrial-scale facilities. To keep with both energy and cooling needs, some researchers say the industry must look to renewable resources. \"Directly connecting data center facilities to wind and solar energy sources ensures that water and carbon footprints are minimized,\" wrote the authors of the aforementioned Environmental Research study. Even purchasing renewable energy certificates — which each represent one megawatt-hour of electricity generated from a renewable source and delivered to the grid — could help shift the grid toward these sources over time, they added. \"Data center workloads can be migrated between data centers to align with the portion of the grid where renewable electricity supplies exceed instantaneous demand.\"Geothermal resources have begun to look especially promising. According to a recent report by the Rhodium Group, geothermal energy could meet up to 64 percent of data center's projected power demand growth in the US \"by the early 2030s.\" In the Western US, geothermal could meet 100 percent of demand growth in areas such as Phoenix, Dallas-Fort Worth and Las Vegas.For cooling, geothermal heat pumps can be used to \"leverage the consistently cool temperatures\" found hundreds of feet beneath the surface. Or, in locations where there are shallow aquifers present, data centers can make use of geothermal absorption chillers. These rely on the low-grade heat at shallower depths \"to drive a chemical reaction that produces water vapor,\" the report explains. \"This water vapor cools as it is run through a condenser and cools the IT components of a data center using evaporation.\" Iron Mountain Data Centers operates a geothermally cooled data center in Boyers, Pennsylvania at the site of an old limestone mine. A 35-acre underground reservoir provides a year-round supply of cool water. Geothermal may not be a widespread solution just yet, but it's catching on. In 2024, Meta announced a partnership with Sage Geosystems to supply its data centers with up to 150 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power starting in 2027. Beyond the hardwareWhile novel cooling methods will undoubtedly help curb some of the AI data centers' excessive resource demands, the first step to meaningful change is transparency, according to Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center. AI companies need to be upfront about the emissions and resource use associated with their operations to give people a clear view of their footprints. Then there is the hardware to consider. Incorporating more intelligent chip design — i.e. processors with better performance characteristics — could go a long way toward making data centers more sustainable. \"That's a huge area of innovation right now,\" Gadepally said. And large data centers are often \"running underutilized,\" with a lot of power that isn’t being allocated efficiently. Rather than leaning into the push to build more such facilities, the industry should first make better use of existing data centers' capacities. Similarly, many of today's AI models are vastly overpowered for the tasks they're being given. The current approach is \"like cutting a hamburger with a chainsaw,\" Gadepally said. \"Does it work? Sure… but it definitely is overkill.\" This doesn't need to be the case. \"We have found in many instances that you can use a smaller but tuned model, to achieve similar performance to a much larger model,\" Gadepally said, noting that this is especially true for new \"agentic\" systems. \"You're often trying thousands of different parameters, or different combinations of things to discover which is the best one, and by being a little bit more intelligent, we could dismiss or essentially terminate a lot of the workloads or a lot of those combinations that weren't getting you towards the right answer.\" Each of those unnecessary parameters isn't just a computational dead end, it's another nudge towards rolling blackouts, less potable water and rising utility costs to surrounding communities. As Gadepally said, \"We're just building bigger and bigger without thinking about, 'Do we actually need it?'\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html?src=rss",
          "content": "With the AI boom, construction of new data centers has skyrocketed, and not without consequence — some communities that count these facilities as neighbors are now facing water shortages and strained power supplies. While tech's data center footprint has been growing for decades, generative AI has seemingly shifted the impacts of these operations toward the catastrophic. What exactly makes these new data centers such a burden on the environment and existing infrastructure, and is there anything we can do to fix it? ChipsThe industry believes AI will work its way into every corner of our lives, and so needs to build sufficient capacity to address that anticipated demand. But the hardware used to make AI work is so much more resource-intensive than standard cloud computing facilities that it requires a dramatic shift in how data centers are engineered. Typically the most important part of a computer is its “brain,” the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It's designed to compute a wide variety of tasks, tackling them one at a time. Imagine a CPU as a one-lane motorway in which every vehicle, no matter the size, can get from A to B at extraordinary speed. What AI relies on instead are Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which are clusters of smaller, more specialized processors all running in parallel. In the example, a GPU is a thousand-lane motorway with a speed limit of just 30 mph. Both try to get a huge number of figurative vehicles to their destination in a short amount of time, but they take diametrically opposite approaches to solving that problem. Phil Burr is Head of Product at Lumai, a British company looking to replace traditional GPUs with optical processors. “In AI, you repeatedly perform similar operations,” he explained, “and you can do that in parallel across the data set.” This gives GPUs an advantage over CPUs in large but fundamentally repetitive tasks, like graphics, executing AI models and crypto mining. “You can process a large amount of data very quickly, but it’s doing the same amount of processing each time,” he said.In the same way that thousand-lane highway would be pretty wasteful, the more powerful GPUs get, the more energy hungry they become. “In the past, as [CPUs evolved] you could get a lot more transistors on a device, but the overall power [consumption] remained about the same,\" Burr said. They're also equipped with “specialized units that do [specific] work faster so the chip can return to idle sooner.” By comparison, “every iteration of a GPU has more and more transistors, but the power jumps up every time because getting gains from those processes is hard.” Not only are they physically larger — which results in higher power demands — but they “generally activate all of the processing units at once,” Burr said. In 2024, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a congressionally mandated report into the energy consumption of data centers. The report identified a sharp increase in the amount of electricity data centers consumed as GPUs became more prevalent. Power use from 2014 to 2016 was stable at around 60 TWh, but started climbing in 2018, to 76 TWh, and leaping to 176 TWh by 2023. In just five years, data center energy use more than doubled from 1.9 percent of the US’ total, to nearly 4.4 percent — with that figure projected to reach up to 12 percent by the start of the 2030s.HeatLike a lightbulb filament, as electricity moves through the silicon of computer chips, it encounters resistance, generating heat. Extending that power efficiency metaphor from earlier, CPUs are closer to modern LEDs here, while GPUs, like old incandescent bulbs, lose a huge amount of their power to resistance. The newest generation of AI data centers are filled with rack after rack of them, depending on the owner’s needs and budget, each one kicking out what Burr described as “a massive amount of heat.” Heat isn’t just an unwelcome byproduct: if chips aren’t kept cool, they'll experience performance and longevity issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) publishes guidelines for data center operators. It advocates server rooms should be kept between 18 to 27 degrees celsius (64.4 to 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Given the sheer volume of heat GPUs kick out, maintaining that temperature requires some intensive engineering, and a lot of energy.The majority of data centers use a handful of methods to keep their hardware within the optimal temperature. One of the oldest ways to maximize the efficiency of air conditioning is a technique of hot and cold aisle containment. Essentially, cold air is pushed through the server racks to keep them cool, while the hot air those servers expel is drawn out to be cooled and recirculated. Many data centers, especially in the US, rely on the cooling effect that occurs as water changes from a liquid to a gas. This is done by drawing hot air through a wet medium to facilitate evaporation and blowing the resulting cooled air into the server room, in a method known as direct evaporative cooling. There's also indirect evaporative cooling, which works similarly but adds a heat exchanger — a device that's used to transfer heat between different mediums. In this type of setup, the heat from the warm air is transferred and cooled separately from the server room to avoid raising the humidity levels indoors. Due in part to their cooling needs, data centers have a tremendous water footprint. The Lawrence Berkeley report found that, in 2014, US-based data centers consumed 21.2 billion liters of water.

A lot of people are still coming to terms with Microsoft's veritable gut-punch of an announcement that the price of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription is about to soar by 50 percent. And if that has already pushed you into washing your hands with Xbox altogether, it looks like Microsoft may soon attempt to tempt you back by giving away its cloud gaming service for free. That is, an extremely limited version of it, with ads. According to The Verge, Microsoft is preparing to announce an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which finally exited beta this week. Sources said to be familiar with Microsoft’s strategy told The Verge that game streaming with ads is already being tested internally with employees. You’ll reportedly be able to play select games that you own as well as a selection of Xbox Retro Classics titles. Microsoft will also offer Free Play Days games, an initiative that already lets Xbox users try games over a weekend. All of this will be possible without a paid Game Pass subscription. But the inevitable catch, beyond the restricted catalogue of available games, is that you could have to watch up to several minutes of ad content before getting into a game, and it sounds like there are a number of time-based restrictions as well. It’s currently being tested with a one-hour time limit, up to five times per month, though that could change come launch. Microsoft could launch its ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming tier in beta soon, and it will reportedly be available on PC, Xbox, handheld devices and on browsers. What isn’t clear is what streaming quality will be offered on the free version. Xbox Cloud Gaming’s recently-unlocked 1440p option is going to be exclusive to Game Pass Ultimate, with Microsoft saving the \"best quality\" streaming for its most expensive plan. You’ll be capped at 1080p on the Premium and Essential tiers. All three paid Game Pass tiers include unlimited cloud gaming, but wait times get longer the further down you go. It’s fair to assume that any free cloud service not tied to Game Pass will be hit with longer wait times, though perhaps the enforced ads would hide those pretty well anyway.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/a-free-ad-supported-xbox-cloud-gaming-option-might-be-on-the-way-165739468.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’re interested in a live TV streaming service, you’re probably looking for one (or all three) of the following: current sports matchups, breaking news and linear, cable-like channels. There are plenty of providers out there and we tried them all out to see what you get for your monthly bill — especially since every live TV streamer has raised prices over the past year or two. That said, in most markets, a live TV streaming service is still more cost-effective than cable. And you still don’t have to sign a contract. Right now, we think YouTube TV is the most well-rounded option — but the others might have more of what you’re looking for. Here are the best live TV streaming services based on our testing.Editor's note: There’s been a lot of hubbub in the streaming world lately. YouTube TV subscribers nearly missed out on access to NBC Universal channels — but the companies ultimately came to a multi-year agreement. Disney (and by extension Hulu+ Live TV) lost a whole bunch of subscribers over free speech dissent — and then announced a price hike for Hulu+ Live TV, bringing it to $90 monthly. Philo implemented a $5 monthly price increase, but users will now get to watch HBO Max and Discovery+, so it’s not all bad. Speaking of HBO Max, customers will no longer get CNN’s livestream as of November 17 because the latter entity is going to try yet again to offer its own service. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube? September 5, 2025 marked the first time YouTube was an official live NFL broadcaster when it aired a Friday night, week-one game of the 2025 NFL season from São Paulo, Brazil. It pit the Los Angeles Chargers against the Kansas City Chiefs (LA won 21-27) and aired worldwide on YouTube for free as well as for subscribers to YouTube TV. There are no other plans for YouTube to air live NFL games for the 2025 season for free, but paid YouTube TV customers will be able to watch many live matchups on their local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations as part of their subscription. Both YouTube TV subscribers and anyone with the YouTube app can subscribe to the NFL Sunday Ticket add-on for $35 to $60 monthly, depending on promotions. Through the YouTube app, you can also purchase access to other Primetime Channels including Paramount+, but it costs the same as paying for those accounts directly. Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are loads of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups — even Netflix. Peacock Premium Plus subscriptions include regional NBC stations. Paramount+ Premium subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The new Fox One service includes multiple live Fox stations. True, if you’re already paying for a service it’s not technically “free” but at least the live content isn’t extra. The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV, Google/Android TV, Roku’s built-in Roku Channel and Samsung’s TV Plus all have hundreds of live channels and original programming. Some of the paid services we recommend above have a free version — namely Sling Freestream, Fubo Free (available after you cancel) and DirecTV’s MyFree. But if you’re looking for more, here are the best free ad-supported TV (FAST) apps with live TV that we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football airs on Netflix. HBO Max (formerly, er, HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, January's Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But on August 21, ESPN launched its own streaming service that includes all ESPN channels and costs $30 per month. Fubo Sports is $56 monthly and includes local broadcast stations from ABC, CBS and FOX plus a slew of sports networks (CBS Sport and FS1 among them) as well as all networks included with ESPN Unlimited. Fox launched its own standalone service in August as well and it includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other entertainment channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $10 per month (or with ads for $6 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "content": "If you’re interested in a live TV streaming service, you’re probably looking for one (or all three) of the following: current sports matchups, breaking news and linear, cable-like channels. There are plenty of providers out there and we tried them all out to see what you get for your monthly bill — especially since every live TV streamer has raised prices over the past year or two. That said, in most markets, a live TV streaming service is still more cost-effective than cable. And you still don’t have to sign a contract. Right now, we think YouTube TV is the most well-rounded option — but the others might have more of what you’re looking for. Here are the best live TV streaming services based on our testing.Editor's note: There’s been a lot of hubbub in the streaming world lately. YouTube TV subscribers nearly missed out on access to NBC Universal channels — but the companies ultimately came to a multi-year agreement. Disney (and by extension Hulu+ Live TV) lost a whole bunch of subscribers over free speech dissent — and then announced a price hike for Hulu+ Live TV, bringing it to $90 monthly. Philo implemented a $5 monthly price increase, but users will now get to watch HBO Max and Discovery+, so it’s not all bad. Speaking of HBO Max, customers will no longer get CNN’s livestream as of November 17 because the latter entity is going to try yet again to offer its own service. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 How to stream live NFL games Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top How to stream live NFL games The rights to air regular-season NFL games belong to a number of networks. Around 200 games are scheduled to appear Sundays on CBS/Paramount+ and Fox/Fox One. NBC/Peacock will host one Sunday night competition each week while Prime Video will air Thursday night contests (except for Thanksgiving week) and ABC/ESPN will show Monday night matchups. A few games will be exclusive to the NFL Network and Christmas-day games will air live on Netflix. YouTube aired a single week-one game. You can see the complete 2025 NFL schedule here (the airing network appears just below the game time on the list). On many Sundays, multiple games are scheduled to air at the same time by the same broadcaster. That means Fox and CBS will broadcast regional games through the associated local affiliate station. Select national games will air through Fox One and Paramount+. To see all Sunday (daytime) matchups, you’ll need the NFL Sunday Ticket that’s now exclusive to YouTube TV and costs between $35 and $115 per month depending on the type of subscription you choose (YouTube recently announced monthly options for the Sunday Ticket). Note that the subscription doesn’t include Sunday night games — for that, you’ll need Peacock and/or local NBC station access through YouTube TV or elsewhere. Most of the paid live TV streaming services we recommend here include the stations you’ll need to see most of the games. YouTube TV, Fubo TV (including the new, cheaper Fubo Sports package), Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV (Signature packages and MySports Genre packs) offer local Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC stations in most (but not all areas). They also carry sports-focused channels from those networks, like Fox Sports, CBS Sports and ESPN. Sling’s Orange plan includes access to a few local channels (varying by area), and also carries ESPN, but you’ll need the combined Orange and Blue plan to also get the Fox Sports channel — but neither plan carries CBS Sports. How can I stream NFL games for free? If you have a digital antenna hooked up to your TV, you can grab games that are broadcast over the airways for your region by tuning into your local CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC stations. You can buy a digital antenna for between $20 and $60. Of course, that won’t get you the games that are exclusive to the NFL Network, Prime Video or Netflix, and you won’t be able to watch games broadcast outside your area. Nearly all paid live TV streaming services are currently offering free trials ranging from a few days to a week. You could hop from service to service, catching a few games before cancelling and not pay anything, but with 18 weeks in the regular season, you’ll obviously not be able to watch all games for free. Alternatively, you can check out your local sports bar and watch a game for the price of a soda and maybe some nachos. As it turns out, bars and restaurants that provide those games to customers have to pay a ton of cash to do so, so you may as well take advantage of the opportunity. Does Paramount Plus stream live NFL games? Yes. Paramount owns CBS, which has historically held the rights to air many NFL games each season. This year, NFL on CBS includes more than 100 regular-season games, most of them Sunday matchups. You can see which NFL games will air on CBS/Paramount + here. Note that to watch your local CBS station you need Paramount+ Premium (formerly Paramount+ with Showtime) for $13 per month. Can you stream live football on YouTube?

Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple (usually four) sports matches or other live content at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV, FuboTV and now DirecTV all let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. DirecTV lets you do so through “mixes” which include sports, news, business and kids variants with a set four channels in each mix. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV. Back to top How we tested live TV streaming services When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town. I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. But those who want to cut the cord will appreciate that streaming services don't have contracts. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million. How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Plex, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous for cord cutters than apps that require login credentials.

          "title": "The best smart rings for 2025",
          "standfirst": "It’s getting increasingly difficult to say smart rings are just a niche inside the broader world of wearable technology. The raft of celebrities who are seen wearing them, the NBA’s use of Oura rings as an early warning system against COVID-19 and, last year, Samsung’s entry into the market has made them far more prominent in the minds of mainstream consumers. We’ve tested plenty of smart rings, and are likely to test plenty more as the years roll on. To help you better understand the category, we’ve built this guide that explains what they do, what they’re for and which ones are worth your time and money right now. Best smart rings for 2025 What is a smart ring? Smart rings offer an alternative to smartwatches and fitness trackers to keep an eye on your health and daily activity. They can track your movements, heart rate, temperature and monitor how well you’ve been sleeping. Essentially, they take much of the same hardware you’d find in a smartwatch or tracker and shrink it down into a much smaller package. The trade-offs are, as such, obvious: Rings are smaller and can’t track anywhere near as many things as a wrist-worn device can. You’ll also miss out on any of the added features that are found on those bigger pieces of gear, like a screen on which to see your notifications or real-time readings of your steps count. But they may be more accurate for your heart rate and temperature, and are significantly more discreet. That discretion is important if you want to keep an eye on your health without looking like you care. Sure, they’re still gadgets, so they’re still noticeably bigger than traditional pieces of jewelry — but not by much. Plus, it’s an alternative for people who don’t like watches, with one statistic saying 68 percent of Americans don’t wear them. What can smart rings track? Much like smartwatches and fitness trackers, smart rings are equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes that can track your movement. That lets them interpret how much you’re moving and, based on whether you toss and turn in the night, how well you’re sleeping. Many rings have PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors to monitor your heart rate and blood oxygenation, either continuously or at intervals. Plus, they often come with temperature sensors that can be used to track signs of infection, and the data they gather on body heat can be used to predict the wearer’s menstrual cycle. It’s possible to use this information to draw broader conclusions about how you’re doing more generally. You can get metrics for your stress, resilience and recovery rates, and you’ll even get data on how calm you are during meditation sessions. I’ve personally been able to look back at stressful days and then compare my vital signs to the baseline. This can be useful to monitor how well, or badly, you’re dealing with stress at any given time and chart progress made. But not all smart rings are alike. Circular’s Ring 2 is one of a handful to offer its own one-line ECG (electrocardiogram). This, like many fitness watches that now offer the same, will look at your heart’s electrical activity to look for irregularities, such as atrial fibrillation. Evie, meanwhile, markets itself as a smart ring “designed for women” with a focus on reproductive cycle tracking. Smart rings vs. smartwatches At the risk of winning this year’s “Yeah, obviously” award, smart rings are not a replacement for smartwatches. Rings do not have built-in displays or vibration motors, so the only way to interact with them is via their companion apps on your phone. There’s no way for you to get any idea of how you’re doing at any given time unless you’re able to look at your primary device. Even activity alerts — pop-ups telling you to move if you’ve been still for too long — can only be pushed to your phone. You won’t get any of the added-value stuff you get with most wrist-worn devices either, and not just the ability to tell the time. That means no calls, apps, message responses, GPS, fall detection or mobile payments via NFC. There are a few exceptions: Samsung’s Galaxy Ring can detect pinch gestures to activate the camera trigger or turn off alarms with a compatible phone. It’s probably worth noting that while no consumer wearable will be as accurate or reliable as a clinical diagnostic tool, the smaller hardware may mean a compromise in accuracy. Rings might also get in the way of certain types of activity, like pull-ups, barbell deadlifts or any other movement that involves gripping onto a handle that might push the accessory into your finger and cause discomfort. Who should use a smart ring? Given the broader features available in even the most basic fitness tracker, it’s hard to say smart rings are a “better” choice. A $300 ring will do a lot less than a $50 tracker, and if you’re led by your wallet, a ring will always work out to be the luxury option. What they offer, however, is a far more elegant aesthetic, especially if you’re not likely to wear a tracker, smartwatch or fitness watch. And that’s before we get to people with skin sensitivities or other reasons for preferring a smaller, more unobtrusive tracker. What to consider before buying a smart ring What do you want to get out of it? Are you hoping a smart ring will encourage you to get out and exercise more? Help you keep an eye on your physical health? Manage your mental health? It’s good to go in with a clear picture of what you want because you may find the limited applications frustrating. Will it fit your finger? Most reputable smart rings will, during the ordering process, send you a sizing kit so you can find the most comfortable model. You’re asked to find a size that sits snugly on your index finger ensuring the sensors make good contact with your skin. The companies often suggest you wear this plastic dummy on your hand for a few days before placing your order. After all, our hands can swell and shrink during the day and depending on the ambient temperature. Normal rings can be sized up or down a bit (by a competent jeweler) if your body shape shifts over time. You can’t do that with most smart rings, so if you do change sizes drastically, you’ll have to go through the process from the start and pay full price again. There are exceptions to this: If you pay for a coverage plan with Ultrahuman, for example, you’ll get one free ring replacement if you lose weight. Anecdotally, some makers will offer ad-hoc discounts if you speak to them but that’s obviously at the discretion of the name in question. One thing to bear in mind is wearing your ring while working out, which might be an issue as pointed out earlier. Depending on your activity, you might find a ring uncomfortable compared to a watch. If gripping onto a dumbbell or handlebars is something you do frequently, it might be better to use a smartwatch or wristworn device. But for runners, swimmers or other folks who don’t need to grab onto much while they work out, a ring should be just fine. What’s the battery life like? Bigger rings will have bigger batteries, so it’s a lot harder to give a clean figure as to how long each ring will last on a charge. Thankfully most rings sip, rather than slurp, at their batteries and so most of them last at least five days or so on a charge. That’s one big plus over some smartwatches given they often will only last a day or so before needing more power. What can you do if you lose your smart ring? Several companies include Find My Ring features in their apps to identify the last location that your ring was connected to your phone. However, if you’re not a fan of minimalism and your home is full, it might be harder to find them. After all, the rings don’t have vibration motors or speakers to offer an audible chirp as and when you’re looking for them. I once lost an Oura Ring 3 for two days before downloading a third-party app that could locate it within a few feet. Turns out, when I’d made my kids’ bed, the ring had fallen into my daughter’s duvet cover, which I found only once I’d turned the room upside down twice. Samsung, meanwhile, offers location-tracking in its app and can give you a rough idea of your ring’s last location. You can also, if you’re hunting for it in dark environments, set its lights to blink, which is something its rivals do not offer. Are there long-term costs? The nature of the technology world, especially in 2025, is that a lot of hardware companies can’t survive selling users one device every three or four years. So, to supplement that income and to offer users a better value proposition, companies offer additional features at an extra cost. That can come in the form of a premium subscription to unlock additional features and insights about your body. There are also one-off purchases to unlock specific features that you may want to focus on, as well as extended warranties or insurances. I’d wager most people plan on wearing a smart ring for several years before opting to upgrade, and so it’s important to keep an eye on the total cost of ownership. If your budget will only stretch to the initial payment and no further, keep in mind what features you’ll be missing out on.

This is a newer version of the unit that topped our list of the best budget robot vacuums. It's an entry-level robovac that gets the job done. The cleaning motor is fairly powerful and it ships with a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush. The vacuum uses LiDAR to map a home and to help it avoid obstacles when cleaning. It's also been equipped with specialized sensors to prevent falling down stairs. Steps are the natural enemy of all robot vacuums, except maybe this one. The Roomba 104 integrates with the company's proprietary app, which allows for custom cleaning schedules and the like. The robot can also be controlled via voice assistant and boasts compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The vacuum will automatically head to the charger for some juice when running low, which is nice. The battery lasts around 200 minutes per charge, which is a decent enough metric for a budget-friendly robovac. The only downside here? This is just a vacuum. It doesn't mop and it doesn't come with a dedicated debris canister.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-roomba-robot-vacuum-is-40-percent-off-for-prime-day-164953707.html?src=rss",

The cleaning motor is fairly powerful and it ships with a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush. The vacuum uses LiDAR to map a home and to help it avoid obstacles when cleaning. It's also been equipped with specialized sensors to prevent falling down stairs. Steps are the natural enemy of all robot vacuums, except maybe this one. The Roomba 104 integrates with the company's proprietary app, which allows for custom cleaning schedules and the like. The robot can also be controlled via voice assistant and boasts compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The vacuum will automatically head to the charger for some juice when running low, which is nice. The battery lasts around 200 minutes per charge, which is a decent enough metric for a budget-friendly robovac. The only downside here? This is just a vacuum. It doesn't mop and it doesn't come with a dedicated debris canister.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-roomba-robot-vacuum-is-40-percent-off-for-prime-day-164953707.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Anker has a bunch of new Prime charging devices available and some of them are already getting solid discounts. The lineup includes a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W). The device's Amazon page currently features a clippable coupon that will take $46 off the price, reducing it by 20 percent. That means you'll be able to snap this powerbank up for $184. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs — the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger — which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously — also gets a 20 percent discount to $184 when you use a clippable coupon. While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is 20 percent off too, at $120 with a clippable coupon. Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.

One of the best discounts at the moment is on the Apple Watch SE 2, which has dropped to $189. That's 37 percent off, or the equivalent of a $110 discount. That's a new record low price for this 40mm variant with a small/medium band. The discount applies to versions with an ink sport loop and denim sport band. It's worth bearing in mind that this deal is for the previous-gen model, which Apple released in 2022. The company started shipping the latest Apple Watch SE in September. That starts at $240 for a GPS and Wi-Fi model without LTE connectivity. The third-gen SE 3 is now our pick for the best budget Apple Watch. However, if you're looking for a cheaper option for fitness tracking, at-a-glance notifications and, perhaps, quick access to a calendar, the second-gen SE is worth considering. Several variants of the Apple Watch Series 10 are on sale on Amazon as well. This is last year's version of the smartwatch, but it's still plenty capable and it supports some of the same new features as the Series 11, such as sleep apnea detection and sleep scoring. You can pick one up for as little as $329.

          "title": "Today's best iPad deals include $50 off the 256GB iPad A16",
          "standfirst": "We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but most of them don’t come cheap. To help make sure you get the most value possible, we’re keeping a constant eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.Sadly, this week’s selection is very light: The $150 drops we saw for the iPad Air last week are gone, the iPad mini isn’t discounted and the current iPad Pro is a no-go with a new model expected to launch very soon. We'd expect more discounts during Amazon's October Prime Day sale next week. That said, if you’ve been interested in the entry-level iPad (A16), you can still take $50 off a model with 256GB of storage. And beyond iPads, we’re still seeing a few decent prices on other Apple devices like the MacBook Air, Pencil Pro and Mac mini. Here are all the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. Best iPad deals Best Apple deals Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal often over the course of the year, but it's a solid discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties an all-time low for an upgraded config with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 512GB) for $1,199 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. This discount is only slightly higher than the best price we've seen for a model with 512GB of storage. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest Apple Watches only hit the market last week, but Amazon is already offering a $10 discount on certain color options. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389, while others show up at the full price of $399. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): You'll see a similar stealth discount on Apple's newest budget model, the SE 3 at Amazon. It goes for $249 regularly. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates from its predecessor, including a faster charging battery, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11. Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $35 ($14 off): Here's a record-low price on Apple's fasted wireless charging puck. It'll work with any iPhone as long it's an iPhone 8 or newer, but if you have an iPhone 16 or 17, this cable can charge your device at 25W when paired with 30W power adapter. Also at Best Buy. The one-meter model is on sale at Walmart for $27.30. Apple Mac mini (M4, 16GB/256GB) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent drop. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Mac mini (M4, 16GB/512GB) for $689 ($110 off): If you want your tiny Apple desktop to have a little bit more storage capacity, you may want to spring for the 512GB model. It's currently $110 off at Amazon and B&H Photo. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off): We may see an updated model by the end of 2025, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultrawide band features that make it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This isn't a great deal for a four-pack — the bundle was as low as $65 in July — but it's still a bit lower than its list price. Also at Walmart. Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port adapter for $39 ($20 off): It's always good to have a few extra ports around. This is the adapter that ships with the M4 with 10‑core GPU MacBook Air, and it can quickly charge iPads, iPhones and anything else powered by USB-C, too. Walmart is also selling Apple's 2-meter fast charge cable for $23 (a $6 discount).

Shark makes some of our favorite robovacs and a few of them are already discounted for Prime members ahead of the sale. The Shark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum is one of them, with a whopping 58-percent discount that brings it down to $230. This discount marks a record low for this model. Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums. There are small variations between them, and a different model is our pick for the best robot vacuum for most people. In general, you can expect solid cleaning performance from these devices, along with accurate home mapping and an easy-to-use app. The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration. If you'd rather plump for a model that's able to mop your floors too, you're in luck: a Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 vacuum is on sale as well. At $300 for Prime members, this vacuum is available for $400 (or 57 percent) off the list price. Its mopping function can scrub hard floors 100 times per minute. You can also trigger the Matrix Mop function in the app for a deeper clean. This delivers 50 percent better stain cleaning in targeted zones, according to Shark.

          "title": "The best MagSafe power banks for your iPhone",
          "standfirst": "Whether you were won over by the cameras on the new iPhone 17 or you’re sticking it out with your iPhone 12, having a little extra power around is never a bad thing. The best MagSafe power bank is one that attaches firmly, charges quickly and blends in with your handset — or better yet, adds a handy stand to the mix. Right now, the fastest wireless portable chargers are Qi2-certified, meaning they can charge at speeds of up to 15 watts. (A new standard, Qi2 25W is now on the market, but has only made its way into a few power banks.) We’ve tested more than a dozen portable chargers to come up with our recommendations for the best MagSafe battery you can buy. The best MagSafe power banks for 2025 What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank Choose the right capacity. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery. Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time. Understand MagSafe versus Qi2. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible. Qi2 is a standard from the Wireless Power Consortium (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible. The newest standard is Qi2 25W and bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC says a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger and phone need to be certified to get those speeds). Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e) will likely support the standard after an update to iOS 26. Remember travel restrictions. You may have seen news reports of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the TSA allows them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries). But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. Southwest, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one. Consider the extra features. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use. Some also have straps to make the bank easier to carry around or fish out of your bag. What about the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery? When Apple introduced the iPhone Air, it announced the new $99 iPhone Air MagSafe Battery in the same breath. It’s now the sole Apple-branded MagSafe power bank — but it only works with the iPhone Air. It’s a pretty divisive battery. In his review of the new phone, Engadget’s Sam Rutherford appreciated that the accessory keeps with the sleekness of the iPhone Air design and liked that it can also charge the new AirPods 3 wirelessly. But Valentina Palladino called out its dismal price-to-capacity ratio. Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim is probably a better bet for all but the most devoted iPhone user. It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness as Apple’s proprietary battery, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper. Other MagSafe batteries we tested Mophie Powerstation Slim 5K The Mophie Powerstation Slim 5K, too, has a super slim design that nearly disappears into the back of the phone as it charges. It makes excellent use of its 5K capacity, delivering a 90 percent refill to an iPhone 15. But it’s a little more expensive than the our top slim pick, Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim, and the squared off design makes it feel bulkier than it actually is. Neither of those make it a bad choice; the MagSafe battery playing field is just terribly competitive right now. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 10K Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro is Qi2-certified and was only a touch slower than other models in terms of charging speeds, boosting an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to full in about two and a half hours. The feel is premium and the stand is sturdy, but it got quite hot during charging, took overly long to refill itself and is pricer and a bit bulkier than similar models. Baseus Picogo 5K The Picogo 5K from Baseus is teensy but still packs a stand and a 5,000mAh capacity. It’s Qi2-certified and delivered a 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. The slim slab of the Anker Nano battery is sleeker. But that one doesn’t have a stand — so if you want to prop up your phone while it charges, go for this one. MagSafe power banks FAQs What does MagSafe do? MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories. Which iPhones support MagSafe? iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories. The new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W. Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case? In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a MagSafe case and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests. How much power do MagSafe batteries provide? That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts. The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-magsafe-power-banks-120015338.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Whether you were won over by the cameras on the new iPhone 17 or you’re sticking it out with your iPhone 12, having a little extra power around is never a bad thing. The best MagSafe power bank is one that attaches firmly, charges quickly and blends in with your handset — or better yet, adds a handy stand to the mix. Right now, the fastest wireless portable chargers are Qi2-certified, meaning they can charge at speeds of up to 15 watts. (A new standard, Qi2 25W is now on the market, but has only made its way into a few power banks.) We’ve tested more than a dozen portable chargers to come up with our recommendations for the best MagSafe battery you can buy. The best MagSafe power banks for 2025 What to consider before buying a MagSafe power bank Choose the right capacity. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery. Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time. Understand MagSafe versus Qi2.

Federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED show that the agency is seeking private vendors to run a multiyear surveillance program out of two of its little-known targeting centers. The program envisions stationing nearly 30 private analysts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities in Vermont and Southern California. Their job: Scour Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms, converting posts and profiles into fresh leads for enforcement raids. The initiative is still at the request-for-information stage, a step agencies use to gauge interest from contractors before an official bidding process. But draft planning documents show the scheme is ambitious: ICE wants a contractor capable of staffing the centers around the clock, constantly processing cases on tight deadlines, and supplying the agency with the latest and greatest subscription-based surveillance software.Read full article Comments",

United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, won contracts for the other two. These missions for the Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office are still at least a couple of years away from flying. SpaceX and ULA are the only companies with rockets certified by the Space Force to launch the Pentagon's big-ticket satellites. ULA's Vulcan rocket, which replaces the company's Atlas V, debuted nearly two years ago and successfully launched its first national security mission in August.

However, a new study has found that mushrooms evolved the ability to make the same psychoactive substance twice. The discovery has important implications for both our understanding of these mushrooms’ role in nature and their medical potential. Magic mushrooms produce psilocybin, which your body converts into its active form, psilocin, when you ingest it. Psilocybin rose in popularity in the 1960s and was eventually classed as a Schedule 1 drug in the US in 1970, and as a Class A drug in 1971 in the UK, the designations given to drugs that have high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This put a stop to research on the medical use of psilocybin for decades. But recent clinical trials have shown that psilocybin can reduce depression severity, suicidal thoughts, and chronic anxiety. Given its potential for medical treatments, there is renewed interest in understanding how psilocybin is made in nature and how we can produce it sustainably.Read full article Comments",

Google has said again and again since announcing the change that sideloading isn't going anywhere, but it's definitely not going to be as easy. The new information confirms app installs will be more reliant on the cloud, and devs can expect new fees, but there will be an escape hatch for hobbyists. Confirming app verification status will be the job of a new system component called the Android Developer Verifier, which will be rolled out to devices in the next major release of Android 16. Google explains that phones must ensure each app has a package name and signing keys that have been registered with Google at the time of installation. This process may break the popular FOSS storefront F-Droid. It would be impossible for your phone to carry a database of all verified apps, so this process may require Internet access. Google plans to have a local cache of the most common sideloaded apps on devices, but for anything else, an Internet connection is required. Google suggests alternative app stores will be able to use a pre-auth token to bypass network calls, but it's still deciding how that will work.Read full article Comments",

Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was sent to the White House in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules associated with red tide.

          "content": "Apple's \"Pro\" iPhones usually look and feel a lot like the regular ones, just with some added features stacked on top. They've historically had better screens and more flexible cameras, and there has always been a Max option for people who really wanted to blur the lines between a big phone and a small tablet (Apple's commitment to the cheaper \"iPhone Plus\" idea has been less steadfast). But the qualitative experience of holding and using one wasn't all that different compared to the basic aluminum iPhone. This year's iPhone 17 Pro looks and feels like more of a departure from the basic iPhone, thanks to a new design that prioritizes function over form. It's as though Apple anticipated the main complaints about the iPhone Air—why would I want a phone with worse battery and fewer cameras, why don't they just make the phone thicker so they can fit in more things—and made a version of the iPhone that they could point to and say, \"We already make that phone—it's that one over there.\" Because the regular iPhone 17 is so good, and because it uses the same 6.3-inch OLED ProMotion screen, I think the iPhone 17 Pro is playing to a narrower audience than usual this year. But Apple's changes and additions are also tailor-made to serve that audience. In other words, fewer people even need to consider the iPhone Pro this time around, but there's a lot to like here for actual \"pros\" and people who demand a lot from their phones.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Fermenting milk to make yogurt, cheeses, or kefir is an ancient practice, and different cultures have their own traditional methods, often preserved in oral histories. The forests of Bulgaria and Turkey have an abundance of red wood ants, for instance, so a time-honored Bulgarian yogurt-making practice involves dropping a few live ants (or crushed-up ant eggs) into the milk to jump-start fermentation. Scientists have now figured out why the ants are so effective in making edible yogurt, according to a paper published in the journal iScience. The authors even collaborated with chefs to create modern recipes using ant yogurt. “Today’s yogurts are typically made with just two bacterial strains,” said co-author Leonie Jahn from the Technical University of Denmark. “If you look at traditional yogurt, you have much bigger biodiversity, varying based on location, households, and season. That brings more flavors, textures, and personality.” If you want to study traditional culinary methods, it helps to go where those traditions emerged, since the locals likely still retain memories and oral histories of said culinary methods—in this case, Nova Mahala, Bulgaria, where co-author Sevgi Mutlu Sirakova's family still lives. To recreate the region's ant yogurt, the team followed instructions from Sirakova's uncle. They used fresh raw cow milk, warmed until scalding, \"such that it could 'bite your pinkie finger,'\" per the authors. Four live red wood ants were then collected from a local colony and added to the milk.Read full article Comments",

The Commonwealth Edison Co. (ComEd) announced in September that it would begin the testing phase of its novel V2G electric school bus charging pilot, the first of its kind in northern Illinois, coinciding with the beginning of the school year. The utility began testing with the River Trails, Troy, and Wauconda school districts—which have all had electric buses for more than two years—in northern Illinois. It is currently collecting data from bidirectional chargers, EV chargers that flow energy both ways. Its testing will determine how the chargers and buses can best transfer energy when parked and plugged into the grid.Read full article Comments",

What if you miss the more carefree days of old, where the fidelity wasn't quite so high, nor were the stakes? Rally Arcade Classics is worth a look. Developed by NET2KGAMES, you might think of RAC as a spiritual successor to legendary titles like Sega Rally and Colin McRae Rally. Forget about the Nürburgring or even street circuits laid out in famous cities you might have visited; instead, this game is about point-to-point racing against the clock—mostly—across landscapes that long-time World Rally Championship fans will remember.Read full article Comments",
