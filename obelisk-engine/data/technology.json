On TV, Copilot takes on a “friendly, animated presence” that resembles the opalescent Copilot Appearance Microsoft showed off last month, though in a color that makes it look more like a personified chickpea. The beige blob will float and bounce around your screen, while its mouth moves in line with its responses. Copilot will automatically appear on supported Samsung TVs, where you’ll find it within the Samsung Tizen OS homescreen, Samsung Daily Plus, and Click to Search. You can access Copilot by using a voice command or selecting it with your remote. From there, hit the mic button on your remote, and you can start speaking to Copilot. Microsoft notes that you can sign into the app for a more “personal” Copilot experience that allows the AI assistant to reference your previous conversations and preferences. Copilot is rolling out now on Samsung’s 2025 TVs, including Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro, and The Frame models, as well as the M7, M8, and M9 smart monitors. Microsoft has previously announced plans to bring Copilot to LG TVs as well.",

The largely successful mission for the world's largest rocket was an important milestone for SpaceX's Starship program after months of repeated setbacks, including three disappointing test flights and a powerful explosion on the ground that destroyed the ship that engineers were originally readying for this launch. For the first time, SpaceX engineers received data on the performance of the ship's upgraded heat shield and control flaps during reentry back into the atmosphere. The three failed Starship test flights to start the year ended before the ship reached reentry. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, has described developing a durable, reliable heat shield as the most pressing challenge for making Starship a fully and rapidly reusable rocket.Read full article Comments",

The post states: Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad. The department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez's ouster. But The Washington Post reported this evening that US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had pressed Monarez on her willingness to rescind approvals for COVID-19 vaccines for days. Monarez reportedly met with Kennedy and other officials Monday and declined to agree to changes without consulting vaccine advisors. Kennedy then urged her to resign for \"not supporting President Trump’s agenda.\"Read full article Comments",

On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users. The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser. Users can grant Claude permission to perform tasks like managing calendars, scheduling meetings, drafting email responses, handling expense reports, and testing website features.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The single-player Star Citizen spin-off Squadron 42 is slated to finally be in players' hands in 2026, 11 full years after its initial 2015 release target. And after all that time, Cloud Imperium Games CEO Chris Roberts says he's hopeful that the title will be received similarly to another 2026 release that happens to be possibly the most anticipated video game of all time: Grand Theft Auto VI. A recent report from French Canadian outlet La Presse (translated) suggests that Squadron 42's launch is being timed so that it \"won't be overshadowed\" by the planned May launch of Grand Theft Auto VI. \"We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event,\" Roberts said in comparing the two upcoming releases in an interview with the French paper. \"Other than GTA VI, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game [of the year].\" That's a pretty bold claim, considering Squadron 42's very public and tumultuous path to a purported \"feature complete\" status in 2023. But it seems at least somewhat reasonable when you consider that GTA VI's development budget of nearly $1 billion lines up closely with $859 million in crowdfunding currently being reported for Star Citizen as a whole.Read full article Comments",

Instead, Corsair's Xeneon Edge is a premium alternative that almost justifies its $250 price tag. Corsair first announced the Xeneon Edge at the CES trade show in January. It's a 5-point capacitive touchscreen that can live on your desk and serve as a secondary computer monitor. If you're feeling fun, you can download Corsair's iCUE software to use customizable widgets for displaying things like CPU temperature and usage, the time and date, and media playing. More adventurous users can attach the screen onto their desktop PC's fan mounts or side panel. I used Corsair's monitor for a couple of weeks. From its build to its image quality and software, the monitor is exemplary for a screen of this kind.

According to the lawsuit, ChatGPT provided detailed instructions, romanticized suicide methods, and discouraged the teen from seeking help from his family while OpenAI's system tracked 377 messages flagged for self-harm content without intervening. ChatGPT is a system of multiple models interacting as an application. In addition to a main AI model like GPT-4o or GPT-5 providing the bulk of the outputs, the application includes components that are typically invisible to the user, including a moderation layer (another AI model) or classifier that reads the text of the ongoing chat sessions. That layer detects potentially harmful outputs and can cut off the conversation if it veers into unhelpful territory.Read full article Comments",

The prologue for The Outer Worlds 2—which I got to play as part of a preview build ahead of the game's planned October 29 launch—throws players into a different kind of deep end, asking them to fill the shoes of an agent in the storied semi-militarized police force of the Earth Directorate. The over-the-top propaganda that leads the game off suggests the Earth Directorate is here to protect colonists from out-of-control corporations and tyrannical governments. But your first mission goes in a different direction, sending you on a secret mission to the \"out of jurisdiction\" Arcadian system, a secretive dictatorship where all the skip drives that power interstellar travel are supposedly manufactured. You've been asked to help expropriate a rare, \"unsealed\" skip drive core, which can then be opened up, studied, and maybe even copied without the risk of catastrophic explosion (the \"right to repair\" folks in the audience might be nodding their heads sagely at this point). Choose your choice I won't spoil things by discussing just how the mission goes off the rails or talking about the somewhat vague twist that closes out the playable prologue. But I will gush a bit about how the first game's mix of retro-futuristic set-dressing and sardonic, cynical writing style immediately shine through, even with the change in perspective. A mix of strong voice acting and motion capture immediately drew me back into the Outer Worlds universe, even when the characters were delivering ridiculous lines like \"You’re not just a cog in the machine.

The data suggests the notable surge in power use is flattening out a bit compared to earlier in the year, with the growth in coal use falling along with it. And despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration, the boom in solar power continues, with solar looking poised to pass hydroelectric before the year is out. Growing, but moderating For the last few decades, the US has largely seen its use of electricity remain flat. That's changed over the last year or so, with energy use ramping up, likely due in part to increased data center use. Earlier in the year, data indicated that demand for electricity was up roughly five percent year-over-year. But that seems to be tailing off over the course of the spring, leaving total electricity demand up by three percent for the January-through-June period. The somewhat lower demand has had a positive effect on coal use. Earlier this year, coal was up by about 20 percent compared to the same period the year before. Now, it's only up by a bit under 17 percent. That's still terrible given coal's environmental and health impacts, not to mention its cost. But it's not as bad as it has been, and it could have been even better had the Trump Administration not forced a coal plant that was slated for closure to stay open.Read full article Comments",

Meanwhile, Golf GTI fans are still sobbing in their beer because 2024 was the last model year you could row your own in the hot hatch—now it's paddles only. Volkswagen updated the 2025 Jetta GLI with a new grille, LED headlights, and light bars that connect across both the front grille and rear taillights. There's a red accent stripe that runs across the lower front fascia and turns up at the front corners, somewhat like The Joker's lipstick, but way less menacing. It's less distinctive than the Golf GTI, though, and the design even reminds me of the 2017-era Honda Accord a bit. So, yes, in a face-off, the Golf GTI wins. The test GLI's wheels get black paint with the Black Package (blackened wheels and side mirror caps).

          "content": "Marine biologist and conservationist David Shiffman was an early power user and evangelist for science engagement on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Over the years, he trained more than 2,000 early career scientists on how to best use the platform for professional goals: networking with colleagues, sharing new scientific papers, and communicating with interested members of the public. But when Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, renaming it X, changes to both the platform's algorithm and moderation policy soured Shiffman on the social media site. He started looking for a viable alternative among the fledgling platforms that had begun to pop up: most notably Threads, Post, Mastodon, and Bluesky. He was among the first wave of scientists to join Bluesky and found that, even in its infancy, it had many of the features he had valued in \"golden age\" Twitter. Shiffman also noticed that he wasn't the only one in the scientific community having issues with Twitter. This impression was further bolstered by news stories in outlets like Nature, Science, and the Chronicle of Higher Education noting growing complaints about Twitter and increased migration over to Bluesky by science professionals. (Full disclosure: I joined Bluesky around the same time as Shiffman, for similar reasons: Twitter had ceased to be professionally useful, and many of the science types I'd been following were moving to Bluesky. I nuked my Twitter account in November 2024.)Read full article Comments",

Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat in his 11th year on Capitol Hill, had some things to say when the House Armed Services Committee met last month to write President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense shield into law. The Republican-led committee debated and voted on an annual defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a sprawling piece of catch-all legislation that does everything from setting pay raises for service members to determining how many airplanes and ships the Pentagon should buy. Moulton is the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, a panel that oversees the military's nuclear and space programs. In this role, the congressman representing Massachusetts' North Shore is using his voice to counter the Trump administration's signature initiative in the military space arena. Ars recently spoke with Moulton, and we present the interview in its entirety below.Read full article Comments",

The settlement announcement comes after Alsup certified what AI industry advocates criticized as the largest copyright class action of all time. Although the lawsuit was raised by three authors—Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber—Alsup allowed up to 7 million claimants to join based on the large number of books that Anthropic may have illegally downloaded to train its AI models.Read full article Comments",
