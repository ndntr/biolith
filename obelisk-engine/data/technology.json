          "content": "A frame from a Sora 2-generated video. OpenAI has a new version of the Sora AI video generator that it launched at the end of last year, and it’s arriving today alongside a new social video app, also called Sora, for iPhones. The currently invite-only app resembles TikTok with a feed of videos you can shuffle through. But instead of encouraging people to stitch together duets, it asks you to record short videos that anyone can spin into new AI-generated deepfakes — with your consent. In a briefing with reporters on Monday, employees called it the potential “ChatGPT moment for video generation.” The Sora app is currently only available to US and Canada users, with other countries set to follow, and when someone receives access, they also get four additional invites to share with friends. There’s no word on when an Android version might be released. Sora users can give their friends — or, if they’re feeling bold, everyone — permission to create “cameos” with their own likeness using the new video model, which is dubbed Sora 2. The person whose likeness is being generated is a “co-owner” of that end result, OpenAI employees said, and they can delete it or revoke access to others at any time. Like TikTok, OpenAI’s Sora app allows you to interact with other videos and trends using a “Remix” feature, but it only allows for the generation of 10-second videos for now. OpenAI currently has a lot of restrictions on generating videos of public figures, but that may not be the case forever, according to the briefing with reporters. Currently, “public figures can’t be generated in Sora unless they’ve uploaded a cameo themselves and given consent for it to be used,” OpenAI wrote in a release accompanying the announcement. “The same applies to everyone: if you haven’t uploaded a cameo, your likeness can’t be used.” OpenAI employees also said it’s currently “impossible to generate” X-rated or “extreme” content via the platform.",

          "content": "The image-sharing site Imgur has shut off access to UK users after the country’s data watchdog warned the platform of a fine, as reported earlier by the BBC. In a post on Imgur’s help page, Imgur confirms that users in the UK can no longer log in, view content, or upload images starting September 30th, 2025. Now, when UK-based users try to access Imgur’s website, it displays a message reading “Content not available in your region.” Imgur will also block UK users from seeing content from the platform embedded on third-party websites, like Reddit, according to Imgur’s help page. Though Imgur doesn’t cite a reason for the change, the UK’s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) says it recently warned Imgur’s parent company, MediaLab, of plans to impose a fine as part of an investigation into its use of children’s data and age verification measures. The UK first started the investigation into Imgur, TikTok, and Reddit’s compliance with its online safety laws in March. The ICO doesn’t specify what Imgur’s proposed fine is for, but notes that its findings are “provisional” and that it will “carefully consider any representations from MediaLab” before deciding whether to impose a fine. “Imgur&#8217;s decision to restrict access in the UK is a commercial decision taken by the company,” the ICO writes. Tim Capel, the ICO’s interim executive director, adds that “exiting the UK does not allow an organisation to avoid responsibility for any prior infringement of data protection law” and that the investigation into Imgur is still underway. The Verge reached out to Imgur with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.",

          "content": "Here are some examples of the “Portraits” avatars available to select Copilot users. Microsoft is trying to make Copilot more approachable by giving the AI assistant an animated face to talk with. The experimental “Portraits” feature in Copilot Labs is currently available in the US, UK, and Canada, and provides 40 stylized human avatars that respond with natural expressions during real-time voice conversations. Announcing the new feature on X, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman says Portraits was developed in response to some Copilot users saying “they&#8217;d feel more comfortable talking to a face when using voice.” The feature allows users to select a portrait and pair it with a voice, aiming to make verbal conversations with the chatbot feel more natural compared to text-based interactions. This is Microsoft’s latest attempt to develop Copilot into a character that’s more appealing to communicate with, having previously announced a similar feature called “Copilot Appearances” in July. The notable difference between the two is that Portraits is based on human appearances instead of an animated cartoon blob. &#8220;This experiment leverages VASA-1, an advanced AI technology developed by Microsoft Research to create real-time, visual AI conversations,” Microsoft announced on the Copilot Discord server. “The innovation allows us to generate natural facial expressions, head movements, and lip-sync from just a single image — no complex 3D modeling required.” The Portraits experiment follows rival AI provider X introducing 3D avatars for its Grok chatbot, including an anime-inspired AI girlfriend companion with an NSFW mode. Microsoft is taking things slow with the rollout of Portraits, likely due to safety concerns around harmful interactions between users and rival chatbots, like those under investigation from Character.AI. “Each portrait is intentionally stylized and not photorealistic, offering you visual variety while offering the same trusted Copilot intelligence and safety features you rely on,” Microsoft said on the Copilot blog. Availability is restricted to a “limited set of users” aged 18 or older, according to Microsoft, with daily and session-based time limits in place alongside “clear indicators that you are interacting with AI technology.”",

And Starship, the rocket's upper stage, will fly on a suborbital arc before reentering the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean for a water landing northwest of Australia. SpaceX will again test the rocket's satellite deployer and reignite one of the ship's Raptor engines in space to adjust the vehicle's path for reentry. These demonstrations will pave the way for future Starship flights into low-Earth orbit.

The law requires companies with annual revenues of at least $500 million to publish safety protocols on their websites and report incidents to state authorities, but it lacks the stronger enforcement teeth of the bill Newsom vetoed last year after tech companies lobbied heavily against it. The legislation, S.B. 53, replaces Senator Scott Wiener's previous attempt at AI regulation, known as S.B. 1047, that would have required safety testing and \"kill switches\" for AI systems. Instead, the new law asks companies to describe how they incorporate \"national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices\" into their AI development, without specifying what those standards are or requiring independent verification. \"California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement, though the law's actual protective measures remain largely voluntary beyond basic reporting requirements.Read full article Comments",

It seems like a new iPad Pro could be one of the announcements on tap. Russian YouTube channel Wylsacom has posted an unboxing video and early tour of what appears to be a retail boxed version of a new 256GB 13-inch iPad Pro, as well as an M5 processor that we haven't seen in any other Apple product yet. This would be the first new iPad Pro since May of 2024, when Apple introduced the current M4 version. The same channel also got ahold of the M4 MacBook Pro early, so it seems likely that this is genuine. And while the video is mostly dedicated to complaining about packaging, the wattage of the included power adapter, and how boring it is that Apple doesn't introduce dramatic design changes every generation, it does also give us some early performance numbers for the new M5.Read full article Comments",

By the time you read this, the World Endurance Championship will be 100 races old. Once centered on the mega-expensive, mega-fast LMP1 hybrids, it's all about the Hypercars now. These are purpose-built, closed-top race cars, with some of the most complex hybrid systems you'll find outside of Formula 1, clad in bodywork that could give the Batmobile a run for its money. These Hypercars are designed to last the distance. During the 24 hours of Le Mans this year, the winning car covered 3,276 miles (5,273 km); for context, an F1 race is usually 190 miles (305 km), and at Monza this year, the race lasted little more than an hour. Here's another difference with F1: When it comes to endurance racing, Ferrari has been winning a lot. In fact, it's taken victory at Le Mans for three years in a row, scoring a hat trick after 50 years away from this corner of the sport. This year has been even better: Ferrari leads the manufacturer's championship and the driver's championship with the #51 factory car. Its closest rival for the driver's title is another 83 Ferrari, this one entered as a privateer car by the AF Corsa team. When the invite arrived to join the team for its race at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to watch it in action and find out the key to that success. \"It has been an amazing challenge for us because after 50 years, it was not simple to restart in the pinnacle of motorsport,\" said Antonello Coletta, head of Ferrari's endurance racing program. Eighteen months after the car was greenlit, it was racing at Sebring in early 2023, a notoriously bumpy WWII bomber base in Florida that is as hard a test on a race car as any. Later that year, the 499P won Le Mans on its first try.Read full article Comments",

Archaeologists originally identified them as Homo erectus, but Hanjiang Normal University paleoanthropologist Xiaobo Feng and his colleagues’ recent digital reconstruction of Yunxian 2 suggests the skulls may actually have belonged to someone a lot more similar to us: a hominin group defined as a species called Homo longi or a Denisovan, depending on who’s doing the naming.

Even at a brief glance, the Subaru Crosstrek clearly prioritizes rugged design and personality over any semblance of aerodynamic efficiency. Subaru’s best-seller also comes only in all-wheel drive, to stay true to customer expectations of all-weather confidence and the appeal of an aspirational adventure lifestyle. And yet, the latest-generation Crosstrek’s new hybrid variant improves power and torque output significantly, while simultaneously resulting in the most efficient Crosstrek to date. Any consideration of aerodynamic improvements for this generation can best be thought of as minor. And yet, the wheel well vents do reduce turbulence and pressure while more cleanly skirting air around the side panels. And some mild smoothing versus the previous generations include tiny elements like the forward-facing edge of the roof rail mounts. However, reduced plastic cladding on the hybrid Crosstreks that might seem intended to improve airflow counterintuitively came about only because Subaru builds the hybrids in Japan for all international markets, and only Americans prefer going overboard on tacky plastic trim pieces. More importantly than aero, the Crosstrek now shares a hybrid powertrain with the Forester SUV. If a naturally aspirated 2.5 L horizontally opposed Boxer four-cylinder engine sounds familiar from Subarus over the past four decades, in reality, this hybrid system significantly works over the flat-four versus even current internal-combustion siblings. This year introduces a host of mechanical modifications to the cylinder head, block, camshaft, crank pulley, fuel system, intake, exhaust, cooling, and more. But more importantly, the engine now runs on an Atkinson cycle, which holds the intake valves open longer to reduce piston resistance during the expansion stroke, resulting in reduced power output but improved fuel efficiency.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Porsche provided flights from Washington to Leipzig and accommodation so Ars could be briefed on the Cayenne Electric. Ars does not accept paid editorial content. LEIPZIG, Germany—Porsche is synonymous with sports cars in which the engine lives behind the driver. From the company's first open-top 356/1—which it let us drive a couple of years ago—to the latest stupendously clever 911 variants, these are the machines most of us associate with the Stuttgart-based brand. And indeed, the company has sold more than a million 911s since the model's introduction in 1963. But here's the bald truth: It's the SUVs that keep the lights on. Without their profit, there would be no money to develop the next T-Hybrid or GT3. The first Cayenne was introduced just 23 years ago; since then, Porsche has sold more than 1.5 million of them. And the next one will be electric. Of course, this won't be Porsche's first electric SUV. That honor goes to the electric Macan, which is probably becoming a more common sight on the streets in more well-heeled neighborhoods. Like the Macan, the Cayenne Electric is based on Volkswagen Group's Premium Platform Electric, but this is no mere scaled-up Macan. \"It's not just a product update; it's a complete new chapter in the story,\" said Sajjad Khan, a member of Porsche's management board in charge of car IT.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "To trap its prey, the Venus flytrap sends rapid electrical impulses, which are generated in response to touch or stress. But the molecular identity of the touch sensor has remained unclear. Japanese scientists have identified the molecular mechanism that triggers that response and have published their work in a new paper in the journal Nature Communications. As previously reported, the Venus flytrap attracts its prey with a pleasing fruity scent. When an insect lands on a leaf, it stimulates the highly sensitive trigger hairs that line the leaf. When the pressure becomes strong enough to bend those hairs, the plant will snap its leaves shut and trap the insect inside. Long cilia grab and hold the insect in place, much like fingers, as the plant begins to secrete digestive juices. The insect is digested slowly over five to 12 days, after which the trap reopens, releasing the dried-out husk of the insect into the wind. In 2016, Rainer Hedrich, a biophysicist at Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany, led the team that discovered that the Venus flytrap could actually \"count\" the number of times something touches its hair-lined leaves—an ability that helps the plant distinguish between the presence of prey and a small nut or stone, or even a dead insect. The plant detects the first \"action potential\" but doesn't snap shut right away, waiting until a second zap confirms the presence of actual prey, at which point the trap closes. But the Venus flytrap doesn't close all the way and produce digestive enzymes to consume the prey until the hairs are triggered three more times (for a total of five stimuli).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Monday, Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.5, a new AI language model the company calls its \"most capable model to date,\" with improved coding and computer use capabilities. The company also revealed Claude Code 2.0, a command-line AI agent for developers, and the Claude Agent SDK, which is a tool developers can use to build their own AI coding agents. Anthropic says it has witnessed Sonnet 4.5 working continuously on the same project \"for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks,\" though the company did not provide specific details about the tasks. In the past, agentic models have been known to typically lose coherence over long periods of time as errors accumulate and context windows (a type of short-term memory for the model) fill up. In the past, Anthropic has mentioned that previous Claude 4.0 models have played Pokémon for over 24 hours or refactored code for seven hours. To understand why Sonnet exists, you need to know a bit about how AI language models work. Traditionally, Anthropic has produced three differently sized AI models in the Claude family: Haiku (the smallest), Sonnet (mid-range), and Opus (the largest). Anthropic last updated Haiku in November 2024 (to 3.5), Sonnet this past May (to 4.0), and Opus in August (to 4.1). Model size in parameters, which are values stored in its neural network, is roughly proportional to overall contextual depth (the number of multidimensional connections between concepts, which you might call \"knowledge\") and better problem-solving capability, but larger models are also slower and more expensive to run. So AI companies always seek a sweet spot in the middle with reasonable performance-cost trade-offs. Claude Sonnet has filled that role for Anthropic quite well for two years now.Read full article Comments",

F-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security. Several weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has joined fellow Democratic senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both of Virginia, and Dick Durbin of Illinois in an effort to halt the move of space shuttle Discovery to Houston, as enacted into law earlier this year. Kelly flew two of his four missions aboard Discovery. \"Why should hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars be spent just to jeopardize a piece of American history that's already protected and on display?\" wrote Kelly in a social media post on Friday. \"Space Shuttle Discovery belongs at the Smithsonian, where millions of people, including students and veterans, go to see it for free.\"Read full article Comments",

The $55 billion deal is the largest leveraged buyout in history and will send ripples through the world of high finance, both within and outside the gaming sector. But even players who have no interest in the business side of the game industry should be paying attention to the news. Analysts who spoke to Ars Technica said that the privately owned version of Electronic Arts will likely be very different from the old public company in ways that could directly affect the kinds of games the mega-publisher produces. A $20 billion hole to fill One of the biggest differences between a publicly owned EA and a privately owned version is that the latter will be saddled with roughly $20 billion of fresh debt provided by JP MorganChase, which is being used to help finance the leveraged buyout. Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter estimates the firm will be on the hook for roughly $1 billion a year in service payments on that debt after the deal closes.Read full article Comments",

This is a feat more difficult than recovering and reusing a rocket's booster stage, something European industry has also yet to accomplish. SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket has a recoverable booster, and several companies in the United States, China, and Europe are trying to replicate SpaceX's success with the partially reusable Falcon 9. While other rocket companies try to catch up with the Falcon 9, SpaceX has turned its research and development dollars toward Starship, an enormous fully reusable rocket more than 400 feet (120 meters) tall. Even SpaceX, buttressed by the deep pockets of one of the world's richest persons, has had trouble perfecting all the technologies required to make Starship work.Read full article Comments",
