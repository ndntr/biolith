          "standfirst": "Apple's latest iterative update for iPhones brings a welcome change for those who aren't a fan of its Liquid Glass design overhaul. After user complaints that the Liquid Glass' translucent design was hard to read, Apple introduced a compromise in iOS 26's fourth beta that allowed for a more frosted look as well as a Reduce Transparency option buried in the Accessibility settings. Now, Apple is making this Liquid Glass toggle available for all iPhone users with iOS 26.1. What is Liquid Glass? Apple debuted Liquid Glass at WWDC 2025 as its major visual redesign, which prompted a lot of comparisons to Windows Vista. Everything from switches and sliders to sidebars and panels would imitate glass, so that users can see the underlying colors and content. While some iPhone users liked the fluidity and freshness, others said the transparent look often created legibility issues, caused lag from the animations and led to eye strain over extended periods of time. How to reduce the Liquid Glass effect To access the new Liquid Glass toggle, make sure your iPhone is updated to iOS 26.1. You can check which version you're by navigating to Settings, then General, then Software Update. After you confirmed that you're on the most recent iOS, you can go back into Settings, then Display & Brightness. From there, you'll find a new setting for Liquid Glass that lets you choose between \"Clear\" or \"Tinted.\" The Clear option is Apple's original vision for Liquid Glass with see-through controls, while the Tinted option \"increases opacity and adds more contrast.\" You can preview the differences between the two choices in the Liquid Glass setting before you commit to one. When in use, the Tinted option switches to the same frosted look first seen by iOS beta testers, which adds a more solid background to panels that have been Liquid Glass-ified. It's important to note that there are only two options and Apple didn't instead opt for a slider to adjust opacity. However, Apple is leaning more into customizability with its operating systems, as indicated by its recently introduced Spatial Scenes feature.

          "standfirst": "Your iPhone may soon be able to do more than call for emergency help and send messages via satellite, according to the latest Power On newsletter. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to expand on satellite features available on iPhones. Apple introduced the ability to send and receive texts with the Messages via Satellite feature last year, but is reportedly looking to enhance this with the option to send photos too. Beyond texting, Apple wants to enable 5G NTN support on its iPhones, which allows cell towers to get a coverage boost by tapping into satellites, according to Gurman. For anyone who needs directions in a remote area without a cellular or Wi-Fi connection, Apple reportedly has plans to introduce satellite connectivity to Apple Maps. Along with these upgrades, Gurman reported that Apple is looking into \"natural usage\" improvements where users won't have to point their iPhones towards the sky to connect to a satellite network. Instead, an iPhone could stay connected even when there's no clear view of the sky, like in indoor environments. On the developer side of things, Gurman said that Apple is also working on an API that allows app makers to add satellite connections. There's no timeline for when these rumored satellite features will go live, but Apple previously waited a couple of years between introducing Emergency SOS via Satellite in 2022 and Messages via Satellite with the release of iOS 18.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-reportedly-working-on-more-satellite-features-for-iphone-172151203.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirPods 4 for $90 (30 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $31 (31 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple iPad mini for $399 ($100 off): Apple's smallest tablet, the iPad mini is the best option for those who prefer their tablet be roughly the size of a paperback book. The latest model runs on the A17 Pro chipset and has an upgraded 128GB of storage in the base configuration. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Also available at Best Buy. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 (50 percent off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

          "title": "How to stretch the clock on your lock screen in iOS 26",
          "standfirst": "Apple has continued its trend of giving users more creative freedom over how their iPhones look and feel, and one of the most striking new customization options in iOS 26 is the ability to stretch the clock on your lock screen. The feature, part of Apple’s refreshed design language for iPhone software, allows the time to expand across more of the screen, giving it a bold, modern appearance. Whether you prefer the minimalist look of small numerals or the dramatic impact of an oversized clock, iOS 26 makes it easy to adjust your lock screen style to suit your taste. This new resizing option is officially referred to as “adaptive time,” and it transforms what used to be a static lock-screen element into something that feels more fluid and responsive. By dragging a simple on-screen handle, you can expand or shrink the size of the time display, creating a distinctive visual effect that gives your lock screen a fresh new personality. How to stretch your lock-screen clock To access the stretch option, start by waking your iPhone and remaining on the lock screen. Instead of unlocking the device, press and hold anywhere on the display to enter customization mode. This brings up a carousel of your saved lock screens, allowing you to edit the one that’s currently active. Tap “Customize,” then choose the “Lock Screen” option to enter the editor. Once the editing screen appears, tap directly on the clock. This will bring up the familiar font and color panel introduced in earlier versions of iOS. To make the stretch feature available, the first font option (the default and leftmost style) must be selected. It should also be set to use the Arabic Western script. After confirming these settings, tap the clock again to close the font panel. If the wallpaper supports the feature, a small circular drag handle will appear in the lower-right corner of the clock. Touch and hold this handle, then drag it downward to stretch the clock. The digits will expand in real time as you move your finger. When you’re happy with the size, release the handle. To save your changes, tap “Done” in the top-right corner of the screen. Exiting customization mode will reveal your new, enlarged clock on the lock screen. If the stretch feature doesn’t appear, the issue is usually related to the font or wallpaper. Some wallpapers, particularly those with subjects that fill the upper portion of the frame, limit how much the clock can expand. If the image leaves little open space, iOS hides the handle to prevent the time from overlapping key parts of the photo. Switching to a simpler or more spacious wallpaper usually resolves this. Understanding the stretched clock feature In previous versions of iOS, the lock-screen clock was fixed in place. Regardless of the wallpaper used, its size and position remained the same. iOS 26 changes that by introducing a resize handle that appears on the bottom-right corner of the clock once the screen is in edit mode. When this handle is dragged downward, the digits expand, allowing the time to stretch dramatically toward the center of the screen. The feature works in both directions, meaning the clock can also be shrunk back to its previous size if the stretched look is too much for you. The stretched clock effect works best with the new Liquid Glass interface design Apple introduced in iOS 26. This approach blends the clock’s font with the background, creating a subtle depth effect where the time appears to hover over the wallpaper. However, the resizing tool is not available on every setup. It only works when specific conditions are met, including the use of the default clock font and the standard Arabic Western script. If any other font or script is selected, the stretch handle will not appear. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Troubleshooting and limitations The stretch function in iOS 26 is a visual adjustment, not a full-scale redesign of the lock screen, and there are a few limitations to be aware of. It works only with the default clock font, and changing the typeface or script will remove the resize option entirely. Users who rely on different numeral styles or custom fonts won’t see the handle appear. Similarly, widgets can interfere with resizing if they occupy too much space beneath the clock. Removing them temporarily can make it easier to adjust the clock size. Some users have reported that the stretch handle disappears after software updates or when certain Focus modes are active. However, restarting your iPhone or disabling those modes typically restores it. As this is a relatively new feature, Apple may still be refining how it behaves across different iPhone models and lock-screen setups. The visual impact of the stretched clock depends largely on your wallpaper. Minimal backgrounds with clean space at the top allow the time to expand without cluttering the screen. Complex or busy images tend to reduce the effect, as the clock will automatically adjust its transparency and positioning to stay readable. The stretched design looks particularly polished on wallpapers that match Apple’s new Liquid Glass aesthetic, where colors subtly blend through the numerals for a semi-transparent glow. Making the most of your stretched clock While the stretch feature is primarily cosmetic, it contributes to the broader trend of personalization across iOS. Apple’s lock-screen customization tools now include options for widgets, depth-aware wallpapers, color filters and dynamic animations, giving users more control than ever over their device’s appearance. The stretched clock fits naturally into this toolkit, offering an easy way to change the entire mood of your lock screen in seconds. For users who prefer a bold, modern design, the larger clock size provides immediate impact and better visibility. Those who favor a more minimalist layout can keep it subtle by dragging the handle upward to restore the smaller, classic look. Whatever your preference, the process is reversible and quick, meaning you can experiment freely without losing your original layout. Apple’s focus with iOS 26 is clearly on personalization and polish. The stretched clock may seem like a small detail, but it captures the overall philosophy behind this update, blending design flexibility with simple, intuitive gestures. With just a few taps and a short drag, your iPhone’s lock screen can transform into something uniquely yours, whether that’s a subtle enhancement or a bold statement across the display.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-stretch-the-clock-on-your-lock-screen-in-ios-26-130032926.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Companies hate to admit it, but the road to production-level AI deployment is littered with proof of concepts (PoCs) that go nowhere, or failed projects that never deliver on their goals. In certain domains, there’s little tolerance for iteration, especially in something like life sciences, when the AI application is facilitating new treatments to markets or diagnosing diseases. Even slightly inaccurate analyses and assumptions early on can create sizable downstream drift in ways that can be concerning.In analyzing dozens of AI PoCs that sailed on through to full production use — or didn’t — six common pitfalls emerge. Interestingly, it’s not usually the quality of the technology but misaligned goals, poor planning or unrealistic expectations that caused failure. Here’s a summary of what went wrong in real-world examples and practical guidance on how to get it right.Lesson 1: A vague vision spells disasterEvery AI project needs a clear, measurable goal. Without it, developers are building a solution in search of a problem. For example, in developing an AI system for a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s clinical trials, the team aimed to “optimize the trial process,” but didn’t define what that meant. Did they need to accelerate patient recruitment, reduce participant dropout rates or lower the overall trial cost? The lack of focus led to a model that was technically sound but irrelevant to the client’s most pressing operational needs.Takeaway: Define specific, measurable objectives upfront. Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For example, aim for “reduce equipment downtime by 15% within six months” rather than a vague “make things better.” Document these goals and align stakeholders early to avoid scope creep.Lesson 2: Data quality overtakes quantityData is the lifeblood of AI, but poor-quality data is poison. In one project, a retail client began with years of sales data to predict inventory needs. The catch? The dataset was riddled with inconsistencies, including missing entries, duplicate records and outdated product codes. The model performed well in testing but failed in production because it learned from noisy, unreliable data.Takeaway: Invest in data quality over volume. Use tools like Pandas for preprocessing and Great Expectations for data validation to catch issues early. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations (like Seaborn) to spot outliers or inconsistencies. Clean data is worth more than terabytes of garbage.Lesson 3: Overcomplicating model backfiresChasing technical complexity doesn&#x27;t always lead to better outcomes. For example, on a healthcare project, development initially began by creating a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify anomalies in medical images.While the model was state-of-the-art, its high computational cost meant weeks of training, and its \"black box\" nature made it difficult for clinicians to trust. The application was revised to implement a simpler random forest model that not only matched the CNN&#x27;s predictive accuracy but was faster to train and far easier to interpret — a critical factor for clinical adoption.Takeaway: Start simple. Use straightforward algorithms like random forest or XGBoost from scikit-learn to establish a baseline. Only scale to complex models — TensorFlow-based long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks — if the problem demands it. Prioritize explainability with tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to build trust with stakeholders.Lesson 4: Ignoring deployment realitiesA model that shines in a Jupyter Notebook can crash in the real world. For example, a company’s initial deployment of a recommendation engine for its e-commerce platform couldn’t handle peak traffic. The model was built without scalability in mind and choked under load, causing delays and frustrated users. The oversight cost weeks of rework.Takeaway: Plan for production from day one. Package models in Docker containers and deploy with Kubernetes for scalability. Use TensorFlow Serving or FastAPI for efficient inference. Monitor performance with Prometheus and Grafana to catch bottlenecks early. Test under realistic conditions to ensure reliability.Lesson 5: Neglecting model maintenanceAI models aren’t set-and-forget. In a financial forecasting project, the model performed well for months until market conditions shifted. Unmonitored data drift caused predictions to degrade, and the lack of a retraining pipeline meant manual fixes were needed. The project lost credibility before developers could recover.Takeaway: Build for the long haul. Implement monitoring for data drift using tools like Alibi Detect. Automate retraining with Apache Airflow and track experiments with MLflow. Incorporate active learning to prioritize labeling for uncertain predictions, keeping models relevant.Lesson 6: Underestimating stakeholder buy-inTechnology doesn’t exist in a vacuum. A fraud detection model was technically flawless but flopped because end-users — bank employees — didn’t trust it. Without clear explanations or training, they ignored the model’s alerts, rendering it useless.Takeaway: Prioritize human-centric design. Use explainability tools like SHAP to make model decisions transparent. Engage stakeholders early with demos and feedback loops. Train users on how to interpret and act on AI outputs. Trust is as critical as accuracy.Best practices for success in AI projectsDrawing from these failures, here’s the roadmap to get it right:Set clear goals: Use SMART criteria to align teams and stakeholders.Prioritize data quality: Invest in cleaning, validation and EDA before modeling.Start simple: Build baselines with simple algorithms before scaling complexity.Design for production: Plan for scalability, monitoring and real-world conditions.Maintain models: Automate retraining and monitor for drift to stay relevant.Engage stakeholders: Foster trust with explainability and user training.Building resilient AIAI’s potential is intoxicating, yet failed AI projects teach us that success isn’t just about algorithms. It’s about discipline, planning and adaptability. As AI evolves, emerging trends like federated learning for privacy-preserving models and edge AI for real-time insights will raise the bar.

          "title": "12 steps you can take right now to be safer online",
          "standfirst": "There's a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: \"How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?\" In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner. But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity. Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device. 10. Use email maskers and private search engines If you're concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you're in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding. For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address. Sam Chapman for Engadget Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track anything you do — it's funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers. 11. Use a data removal service Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you've been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers. Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety. The longer one has your personal information, the more likely it is to leak. The good news is that most brokers (though not all of them) are legally required to delete your data if you ask them to. However, there are a lot of data brokers out there, and they really want to keep your data. Each one makes opting out harder than uninstalling a Norton product — and hundreds of them may have files on you. To make the process easier, you can use a data removal service like DeleteMe or Surfshark VPN's partner service Incogni. 12. Practice physical security Let's close out the list by getting a little old school. I've already discussed how many online scams depend on classic con artistry to work. By the same token, physical infiltration and smash-and-grab tactics still pose a threat to cybersecurity. It doesn't take too much imagination to see how this could work. If you leave your laptop or phone unattended in public, for example, someone might insert a flash drive that loads malware onto the system. In one illustrative case, a thief in the Minneapolis area would loiter in bars, watch people unlock their phones, then steal those phones and unlock them himself. I'm not saying you need to be paranoid every second you're in public. Just use the same level of caution you'd use to protect your car. Lock your phone with a biometric key so only you can open it, and make sure not to leave any device lying around if it can access your online accounts. And at work, be careful not to let anyone into a secure area if they don't have the proper credentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss",
          "content": "There's a fundamental question you can ask of both the internet and real life: \"How do I enjoy my time here without taking unnecessary risks?\" In grass-touching meatspace, you can cut out processed foods, carry pepper spray and avoid skydiving without a partner. But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity. Given the breadth of dangers, it may feel easier to throw up your hands and say that whatever happens will happen. I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files.

Still, while A Pizza Delivery feels close to achieving its goals, it could use more polishing to fully get there. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours on a cozy evening in, but you'll have to look past the parts where it's a little broken.

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. This week saw the arrival of some fairly high-profile ports, a relaxing garden creation game and much more. I've even managed to tear myself away from Football Manager 26 for long enough to tell you about some of them.Barely a week goes by without a fun theme event taking place on Steam and one that runs until November 10 is also going down on the Nintendo eShop. The Metroidvania Fusion Festival is a celebration of — what else? — the broad spectrum of Metroidvania games. It features 245 projects, including upcoming games and demos, and a sale with discounts of up to 90 percent. I've grabbed a few demos to check out this weekend, including Key Fairy (a pacifist bullet-hell game that sees you grappling and dancing your way around enemies), Echo Weaver (a time-loop puzzler that I've mentioned before) and 2D platformer Little Ghost, in which you explore a mixed media world as a cute specter.In terms of deals, Blasphemous is 75 percent off, Blasphemous II is half off, 2D action game Gunbrella (which I've had on my wishlist for years) is 65 percent off and body horror delight Carrion is 22 percent off. I can wholeheartedly recommend Turbo Kid, a quasi-sequel to one of my favorite films of the same name. That's 35 percent off in this sale.Elsewhere this week, I read a solid profile of developer Lente Cuenen in the The New York Times. Cuenen is the developer of Spilled!, a relaxing waterway cleanup game I've been meaning to check out for a while. The piece is an intriguing look into the life of Cuenen, who makes games about boats while living on her boat in the Netherlands.New releasesA couple of notable indies made the leap onto Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 this week, including 1000xResist. This narrative-driven sci-fi adventure from Sunset Visitor and publisher Fellow Traveller Games earned widespread acclaim when it debuted on Steam and Nintendo Switch last year, particularly for its storytelling, visuals and how it explores various themes. It won a Peabody Award too.I have yet to dive into 1000xResist, even though it's been on my PC and Steam Deck for months. PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players now have the chance to jump in as well. What's more, 1000xResist is on Game Pass Premium, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.A little over a year after releasing the full version of the Satisfactory on PC, Coffee Stain Studios and Coffee Stain Publishing have brought the multi-million-selling factory builder to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can play solo or with friends as you construct factories on an alien planet. You'll explore the planet to find resources and maybe even engage in a little combat. In general, both critics and players have rated Satisfactory highly. Some might say it’s more than satisfactory.Pools was one of my favorite games of last year. It's a disquieting walking simulator, an eerie journey through a liminal space. I could almost smell the chlorine as I explored the mazy swimming pool-inspired environments. It's more eerie than downright scary. Developer Tensori brought the experience to iPhone, iPad and Mac this week. The iPad version also works on Apple Vision Pro. To that end, a virtual reality version of Pools is coming to PS VR2 on November 25. You'll be able to check it out in flatscreen on PS5 on the same day.Thrasher is the latest title from Brian Gibson, the artist and composer of the intense rhythm game Thumper (and also the bassist for the noise rock band Lightning Bolt). The arcade action game debuted on Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro last year. It made the leap to Steam (and SteamVR) this week, so you can now play it on a flatscreen for the first time.Thrasher is a very trippy-looking game from developer Puddle and publisher Creature Label. It seems like quite the wild ride and it was named Apple's Vision Pro game of the year for 2024. For what it’s worth. the team behind Thrasher says that the game runs at 90 fps on Steam Deck.Here's a completely different change of pace. Dream Garden is all about creating a relaxing garden space for yourself. You can use hills, rivers, ponds and pebbles to shape the landscape, then add decorations. With the rake tool, you can trace patterns in the sand. There are no limits or timers in this Japanese-inspired game from the duo at Campfire Studio. Dream Garden is out now on Steam.The Falconeer first took flight five years ago — it was an Xbox Series X/S launch title, fact fans. A new edition for Steam called The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster is a complete rework, as solo developer Tomas Sala rebuilt the game from the ground up. It features new tech, overhauled and expanded environments, gameplay upgrades and all of the previous DLC.I'm glad to hear that Sala has improved the flight mechanics. I found it a bit tough to get to grips with the aerial combat when I played The Falconeer back in 2020, but I enjoyed it otherwise. The remastered version (which looks much grander in scope than the original game) is available as a free upgrade for existing owners on Steam. Everyone else can hop in for free until 1PM ET on November 10. While the remaster is now the default option, you'll still be able to access the original version of The Falconeer via a dedicated Steam branch, Hooray for game preservation!Upcoming It wouldn't be an edition of our weekly indie roundup without a dog game, would it? You can play Sheepherds! solo, but Ultimo Disco primarily designed it as a party game for couch co-op or online multiplayer. It is, as the name suggests, a sheepherding game in which you'll corral flocks of sheep to shear their wool.

          "content": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. This week saw the arrival of some fairly high-profile ports, a relaxing garden creation game and much more. I've even managed to tear myself away from Football Manager 26 for long enough to tell you about some of them.Barely a week goes by without a fun theme event taking place on Steam and one that runs until November 10 is also going down on the Nintendo eShop. The Metroidvania Fusion Festival is a celebration of — what else? — the broad spectrum of Metroidvania games. It features 245 projects, including upcoming games and demos, and a sale with discounts of up to 90 percent. I've grabbed a few demos to check out this weekend, including Key Fairy (a pacifist bullet-hell game that sees you grappling and dancing your way around enemies), Echo Weaver (a time-loop puzzler that I've mentioned before) and 2D platformer Little Ghost, in which you explore a mixed media world as a cute specter.In terms of deals, Blasphemous is 75 percent off, Blasphemous II is half off, 2D action game Gunbrella (which I've had on my wishlist for years) is 65 percent off and body horror delight Carrion is 22 percent off. I can wholeheartedly recommend Turbo Kid, a quasi-sequel to one of my favorite films of the same name. That's 35 percent off in this sale.Elsewhere this week, I read a solid profile of developer Lente Cuenen in the The New York Times. Cuenen is the developer of Spilled!, a relaxing waterway cleanup game I've been meaning to check out for a while. The piece is an intriguing look into the life of Cuenen, who makes games about boats while living on her boat in the Netherlands.New releasesA couple of notable indies made the leap onto Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 this week, including 1000xResist. This narrative-driven sci-fi adventure from Sunset Visitor and publisher Fellow Traveller Games earned widespread acclaim when it debuted on Steam and Nintendo Switch last year, particularly for its storytelling, visuals and how it explores various themes. It won a Peabody Award too.I have yet to dive into 1000xResist, even though it's been on my PC and Steam Deck for months. PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players now have the chance to jump in as well. What's more, 1000xResist is on Game Pass Premium, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.A little over a year after releasing the full version of the Satisfactory on PC, Coffee Stain Studios and Coffee Stain Publishing have brought the multi-million-selling factory builder to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can play solo or with friends as you construct factories on an alien planet. You'll explore the planet to find resources and maybe even engage in a little combat. In general, both critics and players have rated Satisfactory highly. Some might say it’s more than satisfactory.Pools was one of my favorite games of last year. It's a disquieting walking simulator, an eerie journey through a liminal space. I could almost smell the chlorine as I explored the mazy swimming pool-inspired environments. It's more eerie than downright scary. Developer Tensori brought the experience to iPhone, iPad and Mac this week. The iPad version also works on Apple Vision Pro. To that end, a virtual reality version of Pools is coming to PS VR2 on November 25. You'll be able to check it out in flatscreen on PS5 on the same day.Thrasher is the latest title from Brian Gibson, the artist and composer of the intense rhythm game Thumper (and also the bassist for the noise rock band Lightning Bolt). The arcade action game debuted on Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro last year. It made the leap to Steam (and SteamVR) this week, so you can now play it on a flatscreen for the first time.Thrasher is a very trippy-looking game from developer Puddle and publisher Creature Label. It seems like quite the wild ride and it was named Apple's Vision Pro game of the year for 2024. For what it’s worth. the team behind Thrasher says that the game runs at 90 fps on Steam Deck.Here's a completely different change of pace. Dream Garden is all about creating a relaxing garden space for yourself. You can use hills, rivers, ponds and pebbles to shape the landscape, then add decorations. With the rake tool, you can trace patterns in the sand. There are no limits or timers in this Japanese-inspired game from the duo at Campfire Studio. Dream Garden is out now on Steam.The Falconeer first took flight five years ago — it was an Xbox Series X/S launch title, fact fans. A new edition for Steam called The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster is a complete rework, as solo developer Tomas Sala rebuilt the game from the ground up. It features new tech, overhauled and expanded environments, gameplay upgrades and all of the previous DLC.I'm glad to hear that Sala has improved the flight mechanics. I found it a bit tough to get to grips with the aerial combat when I played The Falconeer back in 2020, but I enjoyed it otherwise. The remastered version (which looks much grander in scope than the original game) is available as a free upgrade for existing owners on Steam.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida—The field of astrodynamics isn’t a magical discipline, but sometimes it seems trajectory analysts can pull a solution out of a hat. That’s what it took to save NASA’s ESCAPADE mission from a lengthy delay, and possible cancellation, after its rocket wasn’t ready to send it toward Mars during its appointed launch window last year. ESCAPADE, short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, consists of two identical spacecraft setting off for the red planet as soon as Sunday with a launch aboard Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket.Read full article Comments",
