          "content": "As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the cloud, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like Microsoft. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially disastrous consequences at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a pair of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts. Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to present at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure. “I was just staring at my screen. I was like, ‘No, this shouldn’t really happen,’” says Mollema, who runs the Dutch cybersecurity company Outsider Security and specializes in cloud security. “It was quite bad. As bad as it gets, I would say.”Read full article Comments",

I’ve tested about a half-dozen e-bikes for Ars Technica. Each test period has included a ride with my regular group for about 30 miles. Nobody else in my group rides electric, so I try riding with no assist, at least part of the way. Usually I give up after a mile or two, realizing that most e-bikes are not designed for unpowered rides. On the Carbon (as I’ll call it for the rest of this review), you can ride without power. At 35 pounds, it’s no gram-conscious road bike, but it feels lighter than that number implies. My daily ride is an aluminum-framed model with an internal geared hub that weighs about the same, so I might be a soft target. But it’s a remarkable thing to ride an e-bike that starts with a good unpowered ride and lets you build on that with power.Read full article Comments",

A successful return and catch at the launch tower would demonstrate a key capability underpinning Elon Musk's hopes for a fully reusable rocket. In order for this to happen, SpaceX must overcome the tyranny of geography. Unlike launches over the open ocean from Cape Canaveral, Florida, rockets departing from South Texas must follow a narrow corridor to steer clear of downrange land masses. All 10 of the rocket's test flights so far have launched from Texas toward splashdowns in the Indian or Pacific Oceans. On these trajectories, the rocket never completes a full orbit around the Earth, but instead flies an arcing path through space before gravity pulls it back into the atmosphere.Read full article Comments",
