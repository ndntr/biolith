          "content": "This month’s Google Pixel drop includes a broader rollout of the company’s splashy UI revamp. Starting today, Google will bring its Material 3 Expressive design language to Pixel 6 devices and newer, in addition to the Pixel Tablet. Google first revealed the youthful new design language in May before launching it with its Android 16-equipped Pixel 10 phones last month. Along with a more colorful, bubbly look, Material 3 Expressive introduces more personalization options, like iPhone-like calling cards that allow you to create custom call screens for your contacts. In addition to this rollout, Google is bringing a bunch of new features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which it previewed during its Made by Google event last month. That includes Adaptive Audio, a feature that automatically adjusts volume based on the sounds in your environment, as well as a new capability that automatically dampens sudden loud noises to protect your hearing. The update adds background noise reduction when interacting with Gemini as well, and the ability to accept or ignore calls by nodding or shaking your head. Google will also start automatically displaying Maps on your Pixel Watch or WearOS device when you start walking or biking navigation on your phone, allowing you to easily see where you’re going without taking out your phone. These Pixel-specific updates are rolling out now, and “will continue over the next few weeks.” Some other tweaks are coming to a wider range of Android devices, too, including the ability to share Bluetooth audio with friends, access AI-powered writing suggestions in Gboard, and favorite your creations in Emoji Kitchen. There’s a redesigned Quick Share menu that lets you toggle between sending and receiving files, and a new Androidify app that uses AI to create your own Android bot using a selfie and a prompt.",

          "content": "Google has avoided the worst-case scenario in the pivotal search antitrust case brought by the US Department of Justice. More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) secured a major victory when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The remedy phase took place earlier this year, with the DOJ calling for Google to divest the market-leading Chrome browser, release data to competitors, and end many of its search distribution deals. The government is getting almost none of that. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest data and behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals. Chrome remains with Google This case drew many comparisons to the decades-old antitrust case against Microsoft, which nearly saw the company split in two. The company narrowly avoided that fate, and it seems Google will as well—the DOJ came up short on the so-called structural remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, the court didn't believe that a breakup was fair in this situation.Read full article Comments",

That means you can make your friend listen to the new Nourished by Time single with you on the bus, or catch up on Alien Earth with your significant other on a plane. You’ll be able to create a private broadcast and share it to multiple headphones with a QR code or using Fast Pair — perfect for those times when you’re insisting to a room full of people that they absolutely have to listen to Disintegration Loops on headphones to appreciate it. Of course, if you want to host a depressing silent disco, your friends will need headphones that also support LE Audio. Google is expanding Android support to multiple Sony models, including the LinkBuds S, WF-1000XM5, InZone Buds, LinkBuds Open, LinkBuds Fit, WH-1000XM6, and InZone H9 II. That’s in addition to existing support for hearing aids, Samsung’s Galaxy phones, and certain Xiaomi devices. In addition to LE Audio support, Google is also updating the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with Adaptive Audio. That means you can take advantage of active noise cancellation, but still stay aware of your surroundings. So, you won’t hear the constant din of traffic while out for a walk, but if someone honks their horn as you’re about to step out into the street, it’ll cut through. It will also include Loud Noise Protection, which will save your precious eardrums in case a firetruck goes screaming by, sirens blaring.",

Not reviewing content flagged as CSAM or NCM until it was reported at least 16 times. Not doing enough to block users who uploaded CSAM from creating a new account and uploading it again. Failing to maintain paperwork to verify the age of individuals in content on its sites, and not protecting this information, including dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and government IDs. Pornhub must also implement policies to combat CSAM and NCM. In a press release sent to The Verge, Aylo says the settlement doesn’t introduce “any new substantive requirements that were not either already in place or in progress.” Pornhub has long struggled with content moderation, but things came to a head in 2020, when The New York Times published a report detailing the presence of CSAM and NCM on Pornhub, leading Visa and Mastercard to stop processing payments on the site. Pornhub later implemented a policy that requires uploaders to verify the age of the individuals in their videos, as well as confirm that they consent to their appearance.",

The certificates, issued in May, can be used to decrypt domain lookup queries encrypted through DNS over HTTPS, a protocol that provides end-to-end encryption when end-user devices seek the IP address of a particular domain they want to access. Some security experts are also concerned that the certificates may underpin other sensitive services, such as WARP, a VPN offered by Cloudflare. The certificates remained valid at the time this post went live on Ars. Key failures Although the certificates were issued four months ago, their existence came to public notice only on Wednesday in a post to an online discussion forum. They were issued by Fina RDC 2020, a certificate authority that’s subordinate to the root certificate holder Fina Root CA. The Fina Root CA, in turn, is trusted by the Microsoft Root Certificate Program, which governs which certificates are trusted by the Windows operating system. Microsoft Edge accounts for approximately 5 percent of the browsers actively used on the Internet.Read full article Comments",

There are design cues and links back through Audi's history, but this is no pastiche of a retro design as we might have seen from J Mays. Rather, Audi's design team under Chief Creative Officer Massimo Frascella says that the design influences include one of the pre-war Silver Arrows racing cars, the 1936 Auto Union Type C—Audi being one of the four brands that combined to form Auto Union. The design is deceptively large—bigger than a TT or even an R8. Credit: Aud The Concept C has a targa top—here, it's on. Credit: Audi And here, it's off. Credit: Audi The slats that cover the Concept C's rear bring to mind the cooling louvres at the rear of the Type C, necessary to let the heat generated by its monstrous V16 engine to escape the rear engine bay.

The Paper Pro Move is available to order now and starts at $449 for a version with reMarkable's standard Marker accessory and no case. Adding a Marker Pro accessory, which includes a built-in eraser and a nicer-to-hold texture, adds another $50. Folio cases for the device range from $69 to $139, or you can order the tablet without one. Like the full-size reMarkable Paper Pro we reviewed a year ago, the Move uses a Canvas Color E-Ink display to support note-taking and highlighting in multiple colors—according to the spec sheet, it can render 20,000 distinct shades. Both the Paper Pro and the Paper Pro move advertise up to two weeks of battery life, similar 12 ms writing latency, 64GB of storage, a USB-C port for data and charging, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and 2GB of RAM. The Pro Move is somewhat thicker (0.26 inches, up from 0.2 inches for the Paper Pro) and uses a dual-core Arm processor instead of a quad-core model. But the Pro Move also weighs less than half as much as the Paper Pro, making it much more portable.Read full article Comments",

Much of the media coverage has rightly been on how this trend will affect mass-market vehicles.

The DOE’s report cherry-picked evidence, lacked peer-reviewed studies to support its questioning of the detrimental effects of climate change in the US and is “fundamentally incorrect,” the authors concluded. Scientists have accurately modeled and predicted the volume and impact of excess CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere since the 1970s, when Exxon workers first began measuring the impacts of their product on the planet’s atmosphere. Since then, climate science has matured into a crucial tool to help humans gauge how a warming planet may affect everything from weather and crops to the economy and mental health. “This report makes a mockery of science. It relies on ideas that were rejected long ago, supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific knowledge, omissions of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes, and confirmation bias,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, in a statement accompanying the review.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Dolby has announced the features of Dolby Vision 2, its successor to the popular Dolby Vision HDR format. Whereas the original Dolby Vision was meant to give creators the ability to finely tune exactly how TVs present content in HDR, Dolby Vision 2 appears to significantly broaden that focus to include motion handling as well—and it also tries to bridge the gap between filmmaker intent and the on-the-ground reality of the individual viewing environments. What does that mean, exactly? Well, Dolby says one of the pillars of Dolby Vision 2 will be \"Content Intelligence,\" which introduces new \"AI capabilities\" to the Dolby Vision spec. Among other things, that means using sensors in the TV to try to fix the oft-complained-about issue of shows being too dark.Read full article Comments",

Reports circulated last week claiming that Gmail was the subject of a major data breach, citing a series of warnings Google has distributed and increasing reports of phishing attacks. The hysteria was short-lived, though. In a brief post on its official blog, Google says that Gmail's security is \"strong and effective,\" and reports to the contrary are mistaken. This story seems to have developed due to a random confluence of security events. Google experienced a Gmail data breach in June, but the attack was limited to the company's corporate Salesforce server. The hacker was able to access publicly available information like business names and contact details, but no private information was compromised. Over the following weeks, Google alerted Gmail users to an increase in phishing attacks in July and August. It didn't offer many details, but many believed the spike in phishing was related to the corporate server breach. Indeed, more people are talking about hacking attempts on social media right now. This led to the claim that Gmail's entire user base of 2.5 billion people was about to be hacked at any moment, with some reports advising everyone to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. While that's generally good security advice, Google says the truth is much less dramatic.Read full article Comments",

In the What If...? episode—which retconned the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp and Avengers: Infinity War—the trouble started when Hank Pym entered the quantum realm to rescue his wife, Janet. Alas, Janet was now a zombie due to a mysterious quantum virus. Hank was infected in turn right before the pair returned to the lab; Scott Lang/Ant-Man was attacked, but Hank and Janet's daughter, Hope Pym, escaped. Within 24 hours, much of the northwestern US was infected, including many members of the Avengers who showed up to thwart the zombie apocalypse.Read full article Comments",

Rhagobot isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind at the mention of a robot. Inspired by Rhagovelia water striders, semiaquatic insects also known as ripple bugs, these tiny bots can glide across rushing streams because of the robotization of an evolutionary adaptation. Rhagovelia (as opposed to other species of water striders) have fan-like appendages toward the ends of their middle legs that passively open and close depending on how the water beneath them is moving. This is why they appear to glide effortlessly across the water’s surface. Biologist Victor Ortega-Jimenez of the University of California, Berkeley, was intrigued by how such tiny insects can accelerate and pull off rapid turns and other maneuvers, almost as if they are flying across a liquid surface.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Daily squirts of a safe, over-the-counter allergy nasal spray may prevent COVID-19 infections from taking hold, according to results published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine. In a mid-staged trial, the spray appeared to reduce infections by promising 67 percent, though a larger trial will need to confirm that robust efficacy. The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial conducted by researchers at Germany's Saarland University between March 2023 and July 2024. The study included 450 healthy adults, about half of whom (227) spritzed their noses three times a day with the generic antihistamine nasal spray, azelastine, which can be purchased over the counter in the US. The placebo, meanwhile, was a spray with an identical composition except for the absence of the antihistamine. The two groups had similar mixes of previous COVID-19 vaccination and infection statuses. After about 56 days of frequent mistings, only five people using the allergy spray (2.2 percent) caught a SARS-CoV-2 infection, while 15 people using a placebo (6.7 percent) got the pandemic infection. That 4.5 percentage-point drop represents a 67 percent reduction in COVID-19 cases, though the numbers here are small. Still, the researchers noted that the five people using the allergy spray who contracted COVID-19 took more time to get the infection than the 15 in the placebo group (31 days versus 19.5). This could hint that the spray held off some infections from exposures early in the trial. And when the allergy spray users did get COVID-19, they were positive on a rapid antigen test for less time than those infected in the placebo group (3.4 days versus 5.1 days), suggesting they cleared the virus a bit faster.Read full article Comments",

We'll be discussing how tech firms are responding to tariffs so far and how looming chip tariffs could pose the biggest hurdle yet in sourcing alternative supply chains. And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech. Before Trump even took office, experts had warned that his global trade war—imposing tariffs on imports of various goods from various countries in a bid to strike more favorable trade deals for the US—risked spiking prices of popular tech products like laptops, game consoles, and smartphones.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Here in the year 2025, it's not every day that a classic gaming console from the 20th century becomes playable via emulation for the first time. But that's just what happened last week with the release of Ares v146 and its first-of-its-kind support for Mega LD titles designed for the Pioneer LaserActive. Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the LaserActive, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side. Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, Dragon's Lair-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "All of the original US senators who created and sustained NASA's Space Launch System rocket over the last 15 years—Bill Nelson, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Richard Shelby—have either retired or failed to win reelection. However, a new champion has emerged to continue the fight: Texas Republican Ted Cruz. He seems an unlikely hero for NASA's large rocket, which costs the federal government more than $2 billion to launch. Cruz, after all, is a self-described pro-capitalist, fiscal conservative. SpaceX and Blue Origin, which are building large and significantly lower-cost alternatives to the SLS rocket, have large operations in Texas. In previous legislative sessions, Cruz has often carried legislation important to the commercial space industry, such as the American Space Commerce Act and the Space Frontier Act. But now that he chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Cruz has made a significant shift toward supporting the SLS rocket and its chief contractor, Boeing.Read full article Comments",
