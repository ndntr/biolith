About 4,400 of the company's Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX's vice president of Starlink engineering. \"Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,\" Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.Read full article Comments",

To those people, you should raise a middle finger in defiance (they are miserable, after all), and then point them to the tale of Pebble’s unlikely revival. The smartwatch pioneer’s return was a surprise of 2025, and now the company has resurrected one of its last great triumphs. It’s announcing the Pebble Round 2, and company founder Eric Migicovsky is looking to put right what once went wrong. The Pebble Round 2 is the successor to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted in 2015 to what can only be described as frustrated reviews. It was a truly thin smartwatch, with a glorious round display, but that came at the cost of battery life and durability. The fancier components also added to the cost which pushed it to an unreasonable-for-the-time $249. It’s these flaws which the company has sought to address with the Round 2, as well as some of the issues that weren’t deal breakers at the time, but certainly weren’t ideal. For instance, the massive bezel around the display is now a thing of the past, with the Round 2’s 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen now stretching to the edge of its case. The viewing angles have also been dramatically improved, enabling you to check the time without having to move your wrist. The display has also been bonded to the glass crystal, reducing reflectivity and glare which was another downside for the original model. Better still, the battery life is now more than two weeks on a single charge, giving it the sort of Pebble-esque longevity its users demand. And it’s retained that thinness — measuring in at just 8.1mm — which is far more elegant than the chunkier smartwatches from other manufacturers. Plus, there’s dual microphones for interacting with AI agents and dictating messages, as well as step and sleep tracking. Migicovsky explained that the focus here isn’t just to correct some of the more glaring issues from the first model. As he wrote back in 2022, Pebble’s failure was down to its attempt to broaden its appeal beyond the users who had so warmly adopted it in the first place. Consequently, rather than include bulky features like a a built-in optical heart-rate sensor, the focus is on utility. Not to mention a desire to reintroduce some much-needed whimsy into hardware, and empowering users to tinker with their devices, enabling them to craft their own watch faces. Hopefully, we’ll get some time in person with the Pebble Round 2 in the next few days, but in the meantime, it’s up for pre-order from today. It’ll set you back $199, and will begin shipping in May. And if you’ve already put down cash for a Pebble Time 2, and want to change your mind, you can switch your order over, no questions asked.

          "standfirst": "Instagram’s top exec Adam Mosseri expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and discussed the implications for the platform and users. Mosseri shared his thoughts on broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. “Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he wrote. “The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.” He added: “There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.” Mosseri doesn’t address the risk that this will alienate many photographers and other creators who have already grown frustrated with the app — it looks like Instagram is leaning into the AI firehose. And hey: whatever keeps its users using it. Mosseri suggests many complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of “polished” square images, he says, “is dead.” Instead of trying to “make everyone look like a professional photographer,” Mosseri says that more “raw” and “unflattering” images will be how creators can prove they are real — not AI.

LG CES kicks off this weekend. We’ve got a full preview that we’ll update in the run-up to the full show, but the major tech announcements will likely center on chips (ah, AI) and new TV tech (ah, CES). Intel is finally taking the wraps off its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips — the first to debut on the company’s 18A process. With a promised 50 percent performance boost, Intel needs to prove it can still compete with NVIDIA and AMD. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at the Las Vegas show, while AMD’s Lisa Su teases Ryzen 9000-series refreshes and more. This year’s TV obsession is Micro RGB. Samsung is going big — literally — with a Micro RGB lineup spanning 55 to 115 inches. LG, meanwhile, has its own Micro RGB Evo panels, boasting over a thousand dimming zones for that elusive “perfect” contrast. We’ll be on the ground in Vegas to separate the legitimate, exciting new tech from the marketing fluff and AI assistant tchotchkes. And remember me mentioning the celebrity CES parade? Well, will.i.am is back at CES, this time curiously involved with LG’s portable speakers. Check it off your CES bingo card. Continue reading. The era of foldable handheld consoles is coming OneXSugar Wallet has a 4:3 foldable screen and a terrible name. OneXSugar OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company unafraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its pseudo-foldable dual-screen console). This time, while it initially appears to be another standard dual-screen model, the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet instead uses a single foldable screen. The OneXSugar Wallet was teased in a 54-second video on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. Retro Handhelds reports the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. That’s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded, making it very retro-gaming friendly. Given the foldable screen tech, the price might not be. OneXSugar hasn’t shared that detail yet. Continue reading.

Mosseri shared his thoughts on broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. “Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he wrote. “The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.” He added: “There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.” Mosseri doesn’t address the risk that this will alienate many photographers and other creators who have already grown frustrated with the app — it looks like Instagram is leaning into the AI firehose. And hey: whatever keeps its users using it. Mosseri suggests many complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of “polished” square images, he says, “is dead.” Instead of trying to “make everyone look like a professional photographer,” Mosseri says that more “raw” and “unflattering” images will be how creators can prove they are real — not AI. Or you could leave Instagram? — Mat Smith The other big stories (and deals) this morning Netflix releases finale trailer for Stranger Things How to watch Samsung’s First Look CES 2026 presentation Meta buys startup known for its AI task automation agents TCL introduces its own take on a color Kindle Scribe CES 2026: What to expect First up, Samsung. LG CES kicks off this weekend. We’ve got a full preview that we’ll update in the run-up to the full show, but the major tech announcements will likely center on chips (ah, AI) and new TV tech (ah, CES). Intel is finally taking the wraps off its Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3) chips — the first to debut on the company’s 18A process. With a promised 50 percent performance boost, Intel needs to prove it can still compete with NVIDIA and AMD. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote at the Las Vegas show, while AMD’s Lisa Su teases Ryzen 9000-series refreshes and more. This year’s TV obsession is Micro RGB. Samsung is going big — literally — with a Micro RGB lineup spanning 55 to 115 inches. LG, meanwhile, has its own Micro RGB Evo panels, boasting over a thousand dimming zones for that elusive “perfect” contrast. We’ll be on the ground in Vegas to separate the legitimate, exciting new tech from the marketing fluff and AI assistant tchotchkes. And remember me mentioning the celebrity CES parade? Well, will.i.am is back at CES, this time curiously involved with LG’s portable speakers. Check it off your CES bingo card. Continue reading. The era of foldable handheld consoles is coming OneXSugar Wallet has a 4:3 foldable screen and a terrible name. OneXSugar OneXPlayer is quickly establishing itself as a company unafraid to get weird as hell. (Take, for example, its pseudo-foldable dual-screen console). This time, while it initially appears to be another standard dual-screen model, the Android-powered OneXSugar Wallet instead uses a single foldable screen. The OneXSugar Wallet was teased in a 54-second video on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. Retro Handhelds reports the Wallet uses an 8.01-inch OLED with a 2,480 x 1,860 resolution. That’s a 4:3 aspect ratio when unfolded, making it very retro-gaming friendly. Given the foldable screen tech, the price might not be. OneXSugar hasn’t shared that detail yet. Continue reading.

Many handle brown rice, oatmeal and grains, and some function like mini multi-cookers for soups or stews.With so many options available, the best rice cooker for you depends on how often you cook, how much counter space you have and which features matter most. We tested a range of models to find the best rice cookers for everything from small kitchens to big family dinners. Best rice cookers for 2026 How we test rice cookers Since rice is a foundation for so many different cuisines, I placed a high value on a machine’s ability to cook different types of rice well. I started testing each electric rice cooker by making a Japanese style, sushi-grade white rice. The appliances that delivered tasty results moved on to the brown rice round, then the top performers made long-grain white basmati as a final challenge. Some models I tested included a steamer basket, but I didn't try all of them out. This is a rice-only party. Multi-cookers and steaming functions are merely a nice bonus in these, although if that's a feature you want, an instant pot might be more your jam. While I weighed rice tastiness and texture as the most important criteria, I also assessed how easy the machines were to use and to clean. That includes things like how intuitive the cooking functions are, whether the inner pot is nonstick and how well the keep warm setting performs. I also took note of helpful kitchen tools that came included like a measuring cup, which is essential when getting the amount of water just right for each cup of rice.

We rounded up the best laptops for gaming and schoolwork so you can find a machine that does both without compromise. Table of contents Best laptops for gaming and school in 2026 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Best laptops for gaming and school in 2026 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Are gaming laptops good for school? As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell's XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off). Do gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops? Not necessarily — it really depends on how you define \"last longer.\" In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime. But there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs. Gaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day. What is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school? The GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school. For gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering. For schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you're doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.

Quickly, though, trial and error taught the team that it could get rid of all of that complicated data modeling. Notion’s AI engineering lead Ryan Nystrom and his team pivoted to simple prompts, human-readable representations, minimal abstraction, and familiar markdown formats. The result was dramatically improved model performance. Applying this re-wired approach, the AI-native company released V3 of its productivity software in September. Its notable feature: Cutomizable AI agents — which have quickly become Notion’s most successful AI tool to date. Based on usage patterns compared to previous versions, Nystrom calls it a “step function improvement.”“It&#x27;s that feeling of when the product is being pulled out of you rather than you trying to push,” Nystrom explains in a VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “We knew from that moment, really early on, that we had something. Now it&#x27;s, ‘How could I ever use Notion without this feature?’”‘Rewiring’ for the AI agent eraAs a traditional software engineer, Nystrom was used to “extremely deterministic” experiences. But a light bulb moment came when a colleague advised him to simply describe his AI prompt as he would to a human, rather than codify rules of how agents should behave in various scenarios. The rationale: LLMs are designed to understand, “see” and reason about content the same way humans can.“Now, whenever I&#x27;m working with AI, I will reread the prompts and tool descriptions and [ask myself] is this something I could give to a person with no context and they could understand what&#x27;s going on?” Nystrom said on the podcast. “If not, it&#x27;s going to do a bad job.”Stepping back from “pretty complicated rendering” of data within Notion (such as JSON or XML) Nystrom and his team represented Notion pages as markdown, the popular device-agnostic markup language that defines structure and meaning using plain text without the need for HTML tags or formal editors. This allows the model to interact with, read, search and make changes to text files. Ultimately, this required Notion to rewire its systems, with Nystrom’s team focusing largely on the middleware transition layer. They also identified early on the importance of exercising restraint when it comes to context. It’s tempting to load as much information into a model as possible, but that can slow things down and confuse the model. For Notion, Nystrom described a 100,000 to 150,000 token limit as the “sweet spot.” “There are cases where you can load tons and tons of content into your context window and the model will struggle,” he said. “The more you put into the context window, you do see a degradation in performance, latency, and also accuracy.” A spartan approach is also important in the case of tooling; this can help teams avoid the “slippery slope” of endless features, Nystrom advised. Notion focuses on a “curated menu” of tools rather than a voluminous Cheesecake Factory-like menu that creates a paradox of choice for users. “When people ask for new features, we could just add a tool to the model or the agent,” he said. But, “the more tools we add, the more decisions the model has to make.”The bottom line: Channel the model. Use APIs the way they were meant to be used. Don&#x27;t try to be fancy, don&#x27;t try to overcomplicate it. Use plain English.Listen to the full podcast to hear about: Why AI is still in the pre-Blackberry, pre-iPhone era; The importance of \"dogfooding\" in product development;Why you shouldn’t worry about how cost effective your AI feature is in the early stages — that can be optimized later; How engineering teams can keep tools minimal in the age of MCP; Notion’s evolution from wikis to full-blown AI assistants.

          "title": "Seven steps to AI supply chain visibility — before a breach forces the issue",
          "standfirst": "Four in 10 enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents this year. Yet, research from Stanford University’s 2025 Index Report shows that a mere 6% of organizations have an advanced AI security strategy in place.Palo Alto Networks predicts 2026 will bring the first major lawsuits holding executives personally liable for rogue AI actions. Many organizations are grappling with how to contain the accelerating and unpredictable nature of AI threats. Governance doesn’t respond to quick fixes like bigger budgets or more headcount.There&#x27;s a visibility gap when it comes to how, where, when, and through which workflows and tools LLMs are being used or modified. One CISO told VentureBeat that model SBOMs are the Wild West of governance today. Without visibility into which models are running where, AI security collapses into guesswork — and incident response becomes impossible.Over the last several years, the U.S. government has pursued a policy of mandating SBOMs for all software acquired for use. AI models need them more, and the lack of consistent improvement in this area is one of AI’s most significant risks.The visibility gap is the vulnerability Harness surveyed 500 security practitioners across the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. The findings should alarm every CISO: 62% of their peers have no way to tell where LLMs are in use across their organization. There&#x27;s a need for more rigor and transparency at the SBOM level to improve model traceability, data use, integration points, and use patterns by department.Enterprises continue to experience increasing levels of prompt injection (76%), vulnerable LLM code (66%), and jailbreaking (65%). These are among the most lethal risks and attack methods adversaries use to exfiltrate anything they can from an organization’s AI modeling and LLM efforts. Despite spending millions on cybersecurity software, many organizations aren’t seeing these adversaries’ intrusion efforts, as they’re cloaked in living-off-the-land techniques and comparable attack tradecraft not traceable by legacy perimeter systems. “Shadow AI has become the new enterprise blind spot,” said Adam Arellano, Field CTO at Harness. “Traditional security tools were built for static code and predictable systems, not for adaptive, learning models that evolve daily.”IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report quantifies the cost, finding that 13% of organizations reported breaches of AI models or applications last year. Of those breached, 97% lacked AI access controls. One in five reported breaches was due to shadow AI or unauthorized AI use. Shadow AI incidents cost $670,000 more than their comparable baseline intrusion counterparts. When nobody knows which models run where, incident response can’t scope the impact. Why SBOMs stop at the model file Executive Order 14028 (2021) and OMB Memorandum M-22-18 (2022) require software SBOMs for federal vendors. NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework, released in 2023, explicitly calls for AI-BOMs as part of its “Map” function, acknowledging that traditional software SBOMs don’t capture model-specific risks. But software dependencies resolve at build time and stay fixed. Conversely, model dependencies resolve at runtime, often fetching weights from HTTP endpoints during initialization, and mutate continuously through retraining, drift correction, and feedback loops. LoRA adapters modify weights without version control, making it impossible to track which model version is actually running in production.Here’s why this matters for security teams: When AI models are saved in pickle format, loading them is like opening an email attachment that executes code on your computer, except these files, acting like attachments, are trusted by default in production systems. A PyTorch model saved this way is serialized Python bytecode that must be deserialized and executed to load. When torch.load() runs, pickle opcodes execute sequentially. Any callable embedded in the stream fires. These commonly include os.system(), network connections, and reverse shells. SafeTensors, an alternative format that stores only numerical tensor data without executable code, addresses pickle’s inherent risks. Still, migration means rewriting load functions, revalidating model accuracy, and potentially losing access to legacy models where original training code no longer exists. That’s one of the primary factors holding adoption back. In many organizations, it’s not just policy, it’s an engineering effort.Model files aren’t inert artifacts — they’re executable supply chain entry points.Standards exist and have been in place for years, but adoption continues to lag. CycloneDX 1.6 added ML-BOM support in April 2024. SPDX 3.0, released in April 2024, included AI profiles. ML-BOMs complement but don’t replace documentation frameworks like Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets, which focus on performance attributes and training data ethics rather than making supply chain provenance a priority. VentureBeat continues to see adoption lagging how quickly this area is becoming an existential threat to models and LLMs.A June 2025 Lineaje survey found 48% of security professionals admit their organizations are falling behind on SBOM requirements. ML-BOM adoption is significantly lower.Bottom line: The tooling exists. What’s missing is operational urgency.AI-BOMs enable response, not prevention AI-BOMs are forensics, not firewalls.

That’s invaluable to know for incident response, while being practically useless for prevention. Budgeting for protecting AI-BOMs needs to take that factor into account. The ML-BOM tooling ecosystem is maturing fast, but it&#x27;s not where software SBOMs are yet. Tools like Syft and Trivy generate complete software inventories in minutes. ML-BOM tooling is earlier in that curve. Vendors are shipping solutions, but integration and automation still require additional steps and more effort. Organizations starting now may need manual processes to fill gaps.AI-BOMs won&#x27;t stop model poisoning as that happens during training, often before an organization ever downloads the model. They won&#x27;t block prompt injection either, as that attack exploits what the model does, not where it came from. Prevention requires runtime defenses that include input validation, prompt firewalls, output filtering, and tool call validation for agentic systems. AI-BOMs are visibility and compliance tools. Valuable, but not a substitute for runtime security. CISOs and security leaders are increasingly relying on both. The attack surface keeps expanding JFrog&#x27;s 2025 Software Supply Chain Report documented more than 1 million new models hitting Hugging Face in 2024 alone, with a 6.5-fold increase in malicious models. By April 2025, Protect AI&#x27;s scans of 4.47 million model versions found 352,000 unsafe or suspicious issues across 51,700 models. The attack surface expanded faster than anyone&#x27;s ability to monitor it.In early 2025, ReversingLabs discovered malicious models using \"nullifAI\" evasion techniques that bypassed Picklescan detection. Hugging Face responded within 24 hours, removing the models and updating Picklescan to detect similar evasion techniques, demonstrating that platform security is improving, even as attacker sophistication increases. “Many organizations are enthusiastically embracing public ML models to drive rapid innovation,” said Yoav Landman, CTO and Co-Founder of JFrog. “However, over a third still rely on manual efforts to manage access to secure, approved models, which can lead to potential oversights.”Seven steps to AI supply chain visibilityThe gap between hours and weeks in AI supply chain incident response comes down to preparation. Organizations with visibility built in before the breach have the insights needed to react with greater accuracy and speed. Those without scramble. None of the following requires a new budget — only the decision to treat AI model governance as seriously as software supply chain security.Commit to building a model inventory and defining processes to keep it current. Survey ML platform teams. Scan cloud spend for SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Bedrock usage. Review Hugging Face downloads in network logs. A spreadsheet works: model name, owner, data classification, deployment location, source, and last verification date. You can’t secure what you can’t see.Go all in on using advanced techniques to manage and redirect shadow AI use to apps, tools, and platforms that are secure. Survey every department. Check API keys in environment variables. Realize accounting, finance, and consulting teams may have sophisticated AI apps with multiple APIs linking directly into and using the company&#x27;s proprietary data. The 62% visibility gap exists because nobody asked.Require human approval for production models and design human-in-the-middle workflows always. Every model touching customer data needs a named owner, documented purpose, and an audit trail showing who approved deployment. Just as red teams do at Anthropic, OpenAI, and other AI companies, design human-in-the-middle approval processes for every model release. Consider mandating SafeTensors for new deployments. Policy changes cost nothing. SafeTensors stores only numerical tensor data, no code execution on load. Grandfather existing pickle models with documented risk acceptance and sunset timelines.Consider piloting ML-BOMs for the top 20% of risk models first. Pick the ones touching customer data or making business decisions. Document architecture, training data sources, base model lineage, framework dependencies. Use CycloneDX 1.6 or SPDX 3.0. Get started immediately if not already pursuing this, realizing that incomplete provenance beats none when incidents happen.Treat every model pull as a supply chain decision, so it becomes part of your organization’s muscle memory. Verify cryptographic hashes before load. Cache models internally. Block runtime network access for model execution environments. Apply the same rigor enterprises learned from leftpad, event-stream, and colors.js.Add AI governance to vendor contracts during the next renewal cycle. Require SBOMs, training data provenance, model versioning, and incident notification SLAs. Ask whether your data trains future models. Costs nothing to request.2026 will be a year of reckoning for AI SBOMs Securing AI models is becoming a boardroom priority. The EU AI Act prohibitions are already in effect, with fines reaching €35 million or 7% of global revenue. EU Cyber Resilience Act SBOM requirements begin this year. Full AI Act compliance is required by August 2, 2027.Cyber insurance carriers are watching. Given the $670,000 premium for shadow AI breaches and emerging executive liability exposure, expect AI governance documentation to become a policy requirement this year, much as ransomware readiness became table stakes after 2021.The SEI Carnegie Mellon SBOM Harmonization Plugfest analyzed 243 SBOMs from 21 tool vendors for identical software and found significant variance in component counts. For AI models with embedded dependencies and executable payloads, the stakes are higher.The first poisoned model incident that costs seven figures in response and fines will make the case that should have been obvious already.Software SBOMs became mandatory after attackers proved the supply chain was the softest target. AI supply chains are more dynamic, less visible, and harder to contain. The only organizations that will scale AI safely are the ones building visibility now — before they need it.",
          "content": "Four in 10 enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents this year. Yet, research from Stanford University’s 2025 Index Report shows that a mere 6% of organizations have an advanced AI security strategy in place.Palo Alto Networks predicts 2026 will bring the first major lawsuits holding executives personally liable for rogue AI actions. Many organizations are grappling with how to contain the accelerating and unpredictable nature of AI threats. Governance doesn’t respond to quick fixes like bigger budgets or more headcount.There&#x27;s a visibility gap when it comes to how, where, when, and through which workflows and tools LLMs are being used or modified. One CISO told VentureBeat that model SBOMs are the Wild West of governance today. Without visibility into which models are running where, AI security collapses into guesswork — and incident response becomes impossible.Over the last several years, the U.S. government has pursued a policy of mandating SBOMs for all software acquired for use. AI models need them more, and the lack of consistent improvement in this area is one of AI’s most significant risks.The visibility gap is the vulnerability Harness surveyed 500 security practitioners across the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. The findings should alarm every CISO: 62% of their peers have no way to tell where LLMs are in use across their organization. There&#x27;s a need for more rigor and transparency at the SBOM level to improve model traceability, data use, integration points, and use patterns by department.Enterprises continue to experience increasing levels of prompt injection (76%), vulnerable LLM code (66%), and jailbreaking (65%). These are among the most lethal risks and attack methods adversaries use to exfiltrate anything they can from an organization’s AI modeling and LLM efforts. Despite spending millions on cybersecurity software, many organizations aren’t seeing these adversaries’ intrusion efforts, as they’re cloaked in living-off-the-land techniques and comparable attack tradecraft not traceable by legacy perimeter systems. “Shadow AI has become the new enterprise blind spot,” said Adam Arellano, Field CTO at Harness. “Traditional security tools were built for static code and predictable systems, not for adaptive, learning models that evolve daily.”IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report quantifies the cost, finding that 13% of organizations reported breaches of AI models or applications last year. Of those breached, 97% lacked AI access controls. One in five reported breaches was due to shadow AI or unauthorized AI use. Shadow AI incidents cost $670,000 more than their comparable baseline intrusion counterparts. When nobody knows which models run where, incident response can’t scope the impact. Why SBOMs stop at the model file Executive Order 14028 (2021) and OMB Memorandum M-22-18 (2022) require software SBOMs for federal vendors. NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework, released in 2023, explicitly calls for AI-BOMs as part of its “Map” function, acknowledging that traditional software SBOMs don’t capture model-specific risks. But software dependencies resolve at build time and stay fixed. Conversely, model dependencies resolve at runtime, often fetching weights from HTTP endpoints during initialization, and mutate continuously through retraining, drift correction, and feedback loops. LoRA adapters modify weights without version control, making it impossible to track which model version is actually running in production.Here’s why this matters for security teams: When AI models are saved in pickle format, loading them is like opening an email attachment that executes code on your computer, except these files, acting like attachments, are trusted by default in production systems. A PyTorch model saved this way is serialized Python bytecode that must be deserialized and executed to load. When torch.load() runs, pickle opcodes execute sequentially. Any callable embedded in the stream fires. These commonly include os.system(), network connections, and reverse shells. SafeTensors, an alternative format that stores only numerical tensor data without executable code, addresses pickle’s inherent risks. Still, migration means rewriting load functions, revalidating model accuracy, and potentially losing access to legacy models where original training code no longer exists. That’s one of the primary factors holding adoption back. In many organizations, it’s not just policy, it’s an engineering effort.Model files aren’t inert artifacts — they’re executable supply chain entry points.Standards exist and have been in place for years, but adoption continues to lag. CycloneDX 1.6 added ML-BOM support in April 2024. SPDX 3.0, released in April 2024, included AI profiles. ML-BOMs complement but don’t replace documentation frameworks like Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets, which focus on performance attributes and training data ethics rather than making supply chain provenance a priority.

So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth — I got back on social media. The change was short-lived. My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside. Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more. I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months after the ban, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties. But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home. It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram. TikTok purposefully, enthusiastically overloads itself with shoppable content (which isn’t going to change no matter who owns it). YouTube is obsessed with engagement so it ends up rewarding people who flood the platform with AI slop. These platforms aren’t about human connections and the spread of creativity — the stuff that used to draw me in — they’re thinly varnished ecommerce sites sprinkled with brute-forced AI oddities. I’d be sadder about the whole thing if I thought it could be any different. These companies are among the most valuable in the world. The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of 35 percent of the planet. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing. And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before the defection and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself. It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me. Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone public, it may follow a similar monetization push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not yet profitable, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “world without Caesars” shirt gives us some hope). There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out.

          "standfirst": "If you are trying to stay on top of your health this year, a smart scale can make the process feel more manageable. These devices log details like body fat, muscle mass and water levels, then sync everything to your phone so you can see patterns instead of guessing. It is an easy way to track changes and stay motivated between workouts or check-ins with your doctor.Some smart scales keep things simple and focus on just your data, while others tie into big fitness platforms or support multiple users under one roof. With so many choices, we pulled together the best smart scales to help you find one that fits your goals and your budget. Table of contents Smart scale safety Best smart scales for 2026 What to look for in a smart scale How we tested and which smart scales we tested Smart scales FAQs Smart scale safety There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.” A meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight. Best smart scales for 2026 What to look for in a smart scale Weight A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you're after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal. Connectivity Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised. Bone density The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass. Body fat percentage and muscle mass Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale. BMI A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both overly simplistic and often greatly misleading. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care. Pulse Wave Velocity French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights. Wearables and integration Pairing your smart scale with wearables like fitness trackers or smartwatches can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place. Display Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display. App and subscriptions You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware. Data portability Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere. All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.) Power It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails. How we tested and which smart scales we tested For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers: Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2 Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four. Fitbit Aira Air Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway. Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health. It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat. Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product. A solid, reliable, sturdy, strong (checks the dictionary for more synonyms) dependable piece of kit. There’s no romance or excitement on show, but you can trust that however joyless it may be, it’ll do the job in question and will be user-friendly. The hardware is limited, the app is limited, but it certainly (checks synonyms again) is steady. Joking aside, Omron’s Connect app is as bare-bones as you can get, since it acts as an interface for so many of its products. Scroll over to the Weight page, and you’ll get your weight and BMI reading, and if you’ve set a fitness goal, you can see how far you’ve got to go to reach it. You can also switch to seeing a trend graph which, again, offers the most basic visualization of your workouts and progress. Garmin Index S2 Garmin’s got a pretty massive fitness ecosystem of its own, so if you’re already part of that world, its smart scale is a no-brainer. On one hand, the scale is one of the easiest to use, and most luxurious of the bunch, with its color screen and sleek design. I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail. If there’s a downside, it’s that Garmin’s setup won’t hold your hand, since it’s for serious fitness people, not newbies. Withings Body Comp At the highest end, Withings’ flagship Body Comp is luxurious, and luxuriously priced, a figure I’d consider to be “too much” to spend on a bathroom scale. For your money, however, you’ll get a fairly comprehensive rundown of body composition metrics including your weight, body fat percentage, vascular age, pulse wave velocity and electrodermal activity. Its monochrome dot matrix display may not be as swish as the Garmin’s, but it refreshes pretty quickly and feels very in-keeping with the hardware’s overall sleek look. Withings Body Scan If you want to flaunt your cash, you don’t buy a car, you buy a supercar, or a hypercar if you’re flush enough. What then, do we call Withings’ $400 Body Scan if not a super-smart scale, or a hyper-smart scale? As well as doing everything the Body Comp does, plus running a six-lead ECG, segmented body composition, and will even check for neuropathy in your feet. It is the best scale I’ve ever used, it is also the most expensive, and I suspect it’s too much device for almost everyone who’d consider buying one. Smart scales FAQs What's the difference between a smart scale and a regular scale? A regular scale is pretty straightforward — it tells you how much you weigh, and that’s usually it. A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model. What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing. How do smart scales work with more than one person using it? When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it. Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",

Table of contents Smart scale safety Best smart scales for 2026 What to look for in a smart scale How we tested and which smart scales we tested Smart scales FAQs Smart scale safety There are valid reasons to weigh yourself but your self-worth shouldn’t be defined by what number shows up between your feet. If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat. Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.” A meta-analysis from 2016 found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A 2018 study, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight. Best smart scales for 2026 What to look for in a smart scale Weight A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you're after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.

          "standfirst": "The AI narrative has mostly been dominated by model performance on key industry benchmarks. But as the field matures and enterprises look to draw real value from advances in AI, we’re seeing parallel research in techniques that help productionize AI applications. At VentureBeat, we are tracking AI research that can help understand where the practical implementation of technology is heading. We are looking forward to breakthroughs that are not just about the raw intelligence of a single model, but about how we engineer the systems around them. As we approach 2026, here are four trends that can represent the blueprint for the next generation of robust, scalable enterprise applications.Continual learningContinual learning addresses one of the key challenges of current AI models: teaching them new information and skills without destroying their existing knowledge (often referred to as “catastrophic forgetting”).Traditionally, there are two ways to solve this. One is to retrain the model with a mix of old and new information, which is expensive, time-consuming, and extremely complicated. This makes it inaccessible to most companies using models.Another workaround is to provide models with in-context information through techniques such as RAG. However, these techniques do not update the model’s internal knowledge, which can prove problematic as you move away from the model’s knowledge cutoff and facts start conflicting with what was true at the time of the model’s training. They also require a lot of engineering and are limited by the context windows of the models.Continual learning enables models to update their internal knowledge without the need for retraining. Google has been working on this with several new model architectures. One of them is Titans, which proposes a different primitive: a learned long-term memory module that lets the system incorporate historical context at inference time. Intuitively, it shifts some “learning” from offline weight updates into an online memory process, closer to how teams already think about caches, indexes, and logs. Nested Learning pushes the same theme from another angle. It treats a model as a set of nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, and uses that framing to address catastrophic forgetting. Standard transformer-based language models have dense layers that store the long-term memory obtained during pretraining and attention layers that hold the immediate context. Nested Learning introduces a “continuum memory system,” where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules that update at different frequencies. This creates a memory system that is more attuned to continual learning.Continual learning is complementary to the work being done on giving agents short-term memory through context engineering. As it matures, enterprises can expect a generation of models that adapt to changing environments, dynamically deciding which new information to internalize and which to preserve in short-term memory. World modelsWorld models promise to give AI systems the ability to understand their environments without the need for human-labeled data or human-generated text. With world models, AI systems can better respond to unpredictable and out-of-distribution events and become more robust against the uncertainty of the real world. More importantly, world models open the way for AI systems that can move beyond text and solve tasks that involve physical environments. World models try to learn the regularities of the physical world directly from observation and interaction.There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building Genie, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and self-driving cars. World Labs, a new startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, takes a slightly different approach. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots.Another approach is the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) espoused by Turing Award winner and former Meta AI Chief Yann LeCun. JEPA models learn latent representations from raw data so the system can anticipate what comes next without generating every pixel. JEPA models are much more efficient than generative models, which makes them suitable for fast-paced real-time AI applications that need to run on resource constrained devices. V-JEPA, the video version of the architecture, is pre-trained on unlabeled internet-scale video to learn world models through observation. It then adds a small amount of interaction data from robot trajectories to support planning. That combination hints at a path where enterprises leverage abundant passive video (training, inspection, dashcams, retail) and add limited, high-value interaction data where they need control. In November, LeCun confirmed that he will be leaving Meta and will be starting a new AI startup that will pursue “systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.”OrchestrationFrontier LLMs continue to advance on very challenging benchmarks, often outperforming human experts. But when it comes to real-world tasks and multi-step agentic workflows, even strong models fail: They lose context, call tools with the wrong parameters, and compound small mistakes. Orchestration treats those failures as systems problems that can be addressed with the right scaffolding and engineering. For example, a router chooses between a fast small model, a bigger model for harder steps, retrieval for grounding, and deterministic tools for actions. There are now multiple frameworks that create orchestration layers to improve efficiency and accuracy of AI agents, especially when using external tools. Stanford&#x27;s OctoTools is an open-source framework that can orchestrate multiple tools without the need to fine-tune or adjust the models. OctoTools uses a modular approach that plans a solution, selects tools, and passes subtasks to different agents. OctoTools can use any general-purpose LLM as its backbone.Another approach is to train a specialized orchestrator model that can divide labor between different components of the AI system. One such example is Nvidia’s Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and LLMs to solve complex problems. Orchestrator was trained through a special reinforcement learning technique designed for model orchestration. It can tell when to use tools, when to delegate tasks to small specialized models, and when to use the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of large generalist models.One of the characteristics of these and other similar frameworks is that they can benefit from advances in the underlying models. So as we continue to see advances in frontier models, we can expect orchestration frameworks to evolve and help enterprises build robust and resource-efficient agentic applications.RefinementRefinement techniques turn “one answer” into a controlled process: propose, critique, revise, and verify. It frames the workflow as using the same model to generate an initial output, produce feedback on it, and iteratively improve, without additional training. While self-refinement techniques have been around for a few years, we might be at a point where we can see them provide a step change in agentic applications. This was put on full display in the results of the ARC Prize, which dubbed 2025 as the “Year of the Refinement Loop” and wrote, “From an information theory perspective, refinement is intelligence.” ARC tests models on complicated abstract reasoning puzzles. ARC’s own analysis reports that the top verified refinement solution, built on a frontier model and developed by Poetiq, reached 54% on ARC-AGI-2, beating the runner-up, Gemini 3 Deep Think (45%), at half the price. Poetiq’s solution is a recursive, self-improving, system that is LLM-agnostic. It is designed to leverage the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of the underlying model to reflect and refine its own solution and invoke tools such as code interpreters when needed.As models become stronger, adding self-refinement layers will make it possible to get more out of them. Poetiq is already working with partners to adapt its meta-system to “handle complex real-world problems that frontier models struggle to solve.”How to track AI research in 2026A practical way to read the research in the coming year is to watch which new techniques can help enterprises move agentic applications from proof-of-concepts into scalable systems. Continual learning shifts rigor toward memory provenance and retention. World models shift it toward robust simulation and prediction of real-world events. Orchestration shifts it toward better use of resources. Refinement shifts it toward smart reflection and correction of answers.

But as the field matures and enterprises look to draw real value from advances in AI, we’re seeing parallel research in techniques that help productionize AI applications. At VentureBeat, we are tracking AI research that can help understand where the practical implementation of technology is heading. We are looking forward to breakthroughs that are not just about the raw intelligence of a single model, but about how we engineer the systems around them. As we approach 2026, here are four trends that can represent the blueprint for the next generation of robust, scalable enterprise applications.Continual learningContinual learning addresses one of the key challenges of current AI models: teaching them new information and skills without destroying their existing knowledge (often referred to as “catastrophic forgetting”).Traditionally, there are two ways to solve this. One is to retrain the model with a mix of old and new information, which is expensive, time-consuming, and extremely complicated. This makes it inaccessible to most companies using models.Another workaround is to provide models with in-context information through techniques such as RAG. However, these techniques do not update the model’s internal knowledge, which can prove problematic as you move away from the model’s knowledge cutoff and facts start conflicting with what was true at the time of the model’s training. They also require a lot of engineering and are limited by the context windows of the models.Continual learning enables models to update their internal knowledge without the need for retraining. Google has been working on this with several new model architectures. One of them is Titans, which proposes a different primitive: a learned long-term memory module that lets the system incorporate historical context at inference time. Intuitively, it shifts some “learning” from offline weight updates into an online memory process, closer to how teams already think about caches, indexes, and logs. Nested Learning pushes the same theme from another angle. It treats a model as a set of nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, and uses that framing to address catastrophic forgetting. Standard transformer-based language models have dense layers that store the long-term memory obtained during pretraining and attention layers that hold the immediate context. Nested Learning introduces a “continuum memory system,” where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules that update at different frequencies. This creates a memory system that is more attuned to continual learning.Continual learning is complementary to the work being done on giving agents short-term memory through context engineering. As it matures, enterprises can expect a generation of models that adapt to changing environments, dynamically deciding which new information to internalize and which to preserve in short-term memory. World modelsWorld models promise to give AI systems the ability to understand their environments without the need for human-labeled data or human-generated text. With world models, AI systems can better respond to unpredictable and out-of-distribution events and become more robust against the uncertainty of the real world. More importantly, world models open the way for AI systems that can move beyond text and solve tasks that involve physical environments. World models try to learn the regularities of the physical world directly from observation and interaction.There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building Genie, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and self-driving cars. World Labs, a new startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, takes a slightly different approach. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots.Another approach is the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) espoused by Turing Award winner and former Meta AI Chief Yann LeCun. JEPA models learn latent representations from raw data so the system can anticipate what comes next without generating every pixel. JEPA models are much more efficient than generative models, which makes them suitable for fast-paced real-time AI applications that need to run on resource constrained devices. V-JEPA, the video version of the architecture, is pre-trained on unlabeled internet-scale video to learn world models through observation. It then adds a small amount of interaction data from robot trajectories to support planning. That combination hints at a path where enterprises leverage abundant passive video (training, inspection, dashcams, retail) and add limited, high-value interaction data where they need control. In November, LeCun confirmed that he will be leaving Meta and will be starting a new AI startup that will pursue “systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.”OrchestrationFrontier LLMs continue to advance on very challenging benchmarks, often outperforming human experts. But when it comes to real-world tasks and multi-step agentic workflows, even strong models fail: They lose context, call tools with the wrong parameters, and compound small mistakes. Orchestration treats those failures as systems problems that can be addressed with the right scaffolding and engineering. For example, a router chooses between a fast small model, a bigger model for harder steps, retrieval for grounding, and deterministic tools for actions. There are now multiple frameworks that create orchestration layers to improve efficiency and accuracy of AI agents, especially when using external tools. Stanford&#x27;s OctoTools is an open-source framework that can orchestrate multiple tools without the need to fine-tune or adjust the models. OctoTools uses a modular approach that plans a solution, selects tools, and passes subtasks to different agents. OctoTools can use any general-purpose LLM as its backbone.Another approach is to train a specialized orchestrator model that can divide labor between different components of the AI system. One such example is Nvidia’s Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and LLMs to solve complex problems. Orchestrator was trained through a special reinforcement learning technique designed for model orchestration. It can tell when to use tools, when to delegate tasks to small specialized models, and when to use the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of large generalist models.One of the characteristics of these and other similar frameworks is that they can benefit from advances in the underlying models. So as we continue to see advances in frontier models, we can expect orchestration frameworks to evolve and help enterprises build robust and resource-efficient agentic applications.RefinementRefinement techniques turn “one answer” into a controlled process: propose, critique, revise, and verify. It frames the workflow as using the same model to generate an initial output, produce feedback on it, and iteratively improve, without additional training. While self-refinement techniques have been around for a few years, we might be at a point where we can see them provide a step change in agentic applications. This was put on full display in the results of the ARC Prize, which dubbed 2025 as the “Year of the Refinement Loop” and wrote, “From an information theory perspective, refinement is intelligence.” ARC tests models on complicated abstract reasoning puzzles. ARC’s own analysis reports that the top verified refinement solution, built on a frontier model and developed by Poetiq, reached 54% on ARC-AGI-2, beating the runner-up, Gemini 3 Deep Think (45%), at half the price. Poetiq’s solution is a recursive, self-improving, system that is LLM-agnostic. It is designed to leverage the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of the underlying model to reflect and refine its own solution and invoke tools such as code interpreters when needed.As models become stronger, adding self-refinement layers will make it possible to get more out of them. Poetiq is already working with partners to adapt its meta-system to “handle complex real-world problems that frontier models struggle to solve.”How to track AI research in 2026A practical way to read the research in the coming year is to watch which new techniques can help enterprises move agentic applications from proof-of-concepts into scalable systems. Continual learning shifts rigor toward memory provenance and retention. World models shift it toward robust simulation and prediction of real-world events. Orchestration shifts it toward better use of resources. Refinement shifts it toward smart reflection and correction of answers. The winners will not only pick strong models, they will build the control plane that keeps those models correct, current, and cost-efficient.",

          "standfirst": "When Google released its newest AI image model Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image) in November, it reset expectations for the entire field. For the first time, uses of an image model could use natural language to generate dense, text-heavy infographics, slides, and other enterprise-grade visuals without spelling errors. But that leap forward came with a familiar tradeoff. Gemini 3 Pro Image is deeply proprietary, tightly bound to Google’s cloud stack, and priced for premium usage. For enterprises that need predictable costs, deployment sovereignty, or regional localization, the model raised the bar without offering many viable alternatives.Alibaba’s Qwen team of AI researchers — already having a banner year with numerous powerful open source AI model releases — is now answering with its own alternative, Qwen-Image-2512, once again available freely for developers and even large enterprises for commercial purposes under a standard, permissive Apache 2.0 license.The model can be used directly by consumers via Qwen Chat, and its full open-source weights are up on Hugging Face or ModelScope, and inspected or integrated from source on GitHub. For zero-install experimentation, the Qwen team also provides a hosted Hugging Face demo and a browser-based ModelScope demo. Enterprises that prefer managed inference can access the same generation capabilities through Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio API.A response to a changing enterprise marketThe impact of Gemini 3 Pro Image was not subtle. Its ability to generate production-ready diagrams, slides, menus, and multilingual visuals pushed image generation beyond creative experimentation and into enterprise infrastructure territory—a shift reflected across broader conversations around orchestration, data pipelines, and AI security.In that framing, image models are no longer artistic tools. They are workflow components, expected to slot into documentation systems, design pipelines, marketing automation, and training platforms with consistency and control.Most responses to Google’s move have been proprietary: API-only access, usage-based pricing, and tight platform coupling — such as OpenAI&#x27;s own GPT Image 1.5 released earlier this month.Qwen-Image-2512 takes a different approach, betting that performance parity plus openness is what a large segment of the enterprise market actually wants.What Qwen-Image-2512 improves—and why it mattersThe December 2512 update focuses on three areas that have become non-negotiable for enterprise image generation.Human realism and environmental coherence: Qwen-Image-2512 significantly reduces the “AI look” that has long plagued open models. Facial features show age and texture more accurately, postures adhere more closely to prompts, and background environments are rendered with clearer semantic context. For enterprises using synthetic imagery in training, simulations, or internal communications, this realism is essential for credibility.Natural texture fidelity: Landscapes, water, animal fur, and materials are rendered with finer detail and smoother gradients. These improvements are not cosmetic; they enable synthetic imagery for ecommerce, education, and visualization without extensive manual cleanup.Structured text and layout rendering: Qwen-Image-2512 improves embedded text accuracy and layout consistency, supporting both Chinese and English prompts. Slides, posters, infographics, and mixed text-image compositions are more legible and more faithful to instructions. This is the same category where Gemini 3 Pro Image drew the loudest praise—and where many earlier open models struggled.In blind, human-evaluated testing on Alibaba’s AI Arena, Qwen-Image-2512 ranks as the strongest open-source image model and remains competitive with closed systems, reinforcing its claim as a production-ready option rather than a research preview.Open source changes the deployment calculusWhere Qwen-Image-2512 most clearly differentiates itself is licensing. Released under Apache 2.0, the model can be freely used, modified, fine-tuned, and deployed commercially.For enterprises, this unlocks options that proprietary models do not:Cost control: At scale, per-image API pricing compounds quickly. Self-hosting allows organizations to amortize infrastructure costs instead of paying perpetual usage fees.Data governance: Regulated industries often require strict control over data residency, logging, and auditability.Localization and customization: Teams can adapt models for regional languages, cultural norms, or internal style guides without waiting on a vendor roadmap.By contrast, Gemini 3 Pro Image offers strong governance assurances but remains inseparable from Google’s infrastructure and pricing model.API pricing for managed deploymentsFor teams that prefer managed inference, Qwen-Image-2512 is available via Alibaba Cloud Model Studio as qwen-image-max, priced at $0.075 per generated image. The API accepts text input and returns image output, with rate limits suitable for production workloads. Free quotas are limited, and usage transitions to paid billing once credits are exhausted.This hybrid approach—open weights paired with a commercial API—mirrors how many enterprises deploy AI today: experimentation and customization in-house, with managed services layered on where operational simplicity matters.Competitive, but philosophically differentQwen-Image-2512 is not positioned as a universal replacement for Gemini 3 Pro Image. Google’s model benefits from deep integration with Vertex AI, Workspace, Ads, and Gemini’s broader reasoning stack. For organizations already committed to Google Cloud, Nano Banana Pro fits naturally into existing pipelines.Qwen’s strategy is more modular. The model integrates cleanly with open tooling and custom orchestration layers, making it attractive to teams building their own AI stacks or combining image generation with internal data systems.A signal to the marketThe release of Qwen-Image-2512 reinforces a broader shift: open-source AI is no longer content to trail proprietary systems by a generation. Instead, it is selectively matching the capabilities that matter most for enterprise deployment—text fidelity, layout control, and realism—while preserving the freedoms enterprises increasingly demand.Google’s Gemini 3 Pro Image raised the ceiling.

          "standfirst": "It's no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram's top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.Mosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. \"Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,\" he wrote. \"The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.\"But Mosseri doesn't seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is \"a lot of amazing AI content\" and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by \"fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.\"From Mosseri (emphasis his):Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.On some level, it's easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we've previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta's own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can't reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram's 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else's problem, not Meta's. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to \"to verify authenticity at capture.\" Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.Mosseri also doesn't really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram's algorithm doesn't consistently surface their posts to their on followers.But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of \"polished\" square images, he says, \"is dead.\" Camera companies, in his estimation, are \"are betting on the wrong aesthetic\" by trying to \"make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.\" Instead, he says that more \"raw\" and \"unflattering\" images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.

You still have until the end of the day to donate to a good cause and get a chance to win your share of over $4,000 worth of swag (no purchase necessary to win). So far in this year's charity drive, over 450 readers have contributed nearly $38,000 to either the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Child's Play as part of the charity drive (EFF has now taken a slight lead in the donation totals so far). That's still a ways away from 2020's record haul of over $58,000, but I know we can make a run at it if readers really dig deep today! If you've been putting off your donation, now is the time to stop that procrastination. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it and while you can still enter our sweepstakes.Read full article Comments",

Sales were down almost 16 percent during the final three months of last year, meaning the company sold 77,343 fewer electric vehicles than it did during the same period in 2024. For the entire year, the decline looks slightly better with a drop of 8.6 percent year over year. That means Tesla sold 1,636,129 cars in 2025, 153,097 fewer than it managed in 2024. Which in turn is more than it managed to shift in 2023. Sales issues Contributing factors to the poor sales are legion. The brand still relies on the Models 3 and Y to an overwhelming extent, and other than a mild cosmetic refresh, neither feels fresh or modern compared with competitors from Europe and Asia.Read full article Comments",

The leaks were caused by microscopic structural cracks inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the Zvezda module. The problem has been a long-running worry for Russian and US operators of the station, especially after the rate of leakage doubled in 2024. This prompted NASA officials to label the leak as a \"high likelihood\" and \"high consequence\" risk. However, recently two sources indicated that the leaks have stopped.

Part of the MCU’s Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings) and Andrew Guest (Hawkeye), with Guest serving as showrunner. As previously reported, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon’s brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon’s agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control. Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, Bechir Sylvain, and Manny McCord will also appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles Rounding out the cast is Ben Kingsley, reprising his MCU role as failed actor Trevor Slattery. You may recall Slattery from 2013’s Iron Man 3, hired by the villain of that film to pretend to be the leader of an international terrorist organization called the Ten Rings.Slattery showed up again in 2021’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,rehabilitated after a stint in prison; he helped the titular Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) on his journey to the mythical village of Ta Lo.Read full article Comments",

Their four limbs and tail all contact the ground at slow speeds, while they use a hopping gait at higher speeds. Typically, high-speed movements are more energy-intensive than slow-speed motion, but the opposite is true for macropods like kangaroos; somehow the hopping speed and energy cost become uncoupled. According to a paper published in the journal eLife, this may be due to changes in a kangaroo's posture at higher hopping speeds.Read full article Comments",

Here’s what we can expect in 2026 and beyond. Subscription prices keep rising, but perhaps not as expected There’s virtually no hope of streaming subscription prices plateauing in 2026. Streaming companies continue to face challenges as content production and licensing costs rise, and it's often easier to get current customers to pay slightly more than to acquire new subscribers.

It's been a strange year for movies. Most of the big, splashy tentpole projects proved disappointing, while several more modest films either produced or acquired by streaming platforms—and only briefly released in theaters—wound up making our year-end list. This pattern was not intentional. But streaming platforms have been increasingly moving into the film space with small to medium-sized budgets—i.e., the kind of fare that used to be commonplace but has struggled to compete over the last two decades as blockbusters and elaborate superhero franchises dominated the box office. Add in lingering superhero fatigue—only one superhero saga made our final list this year—plus Netflix's controversial bid to acquire Warner Bros., and we just might be approaching a sea change in how movies are made and distributed, and by whom. How this all plays out in the coming year is anybody's guess.Read full article Comments",
