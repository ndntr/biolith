          "content": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale (aka Prime Big Deal Days) is finally here, and we’ve collected the best deals we could find on everything from noise-canceling headphones and robot vacuums to 4K OLED TVs. The majority of our recommendations have been thoroughly tested by Verge writers and editors, and we are just as confident in our recommendations for a $25 Bluetooth speaker as we are in a $780 smartwatch. Some of these gadgets are available for less than they were during Amazon’s most recent Prime Day sale in July, so your patience has been rewarded if you sat the last one out. By that logic, it might be tempting to wait until Black Friday for an even better deal, but there’s no guarantee prices will drop further. Some gadgets may be in short supply come the holidays, and the impact of tariffs could lead to deal prices that don’t align with your expectations. So if you’re jumping in below, remember that you need an active Amazon Prime subscription. (Here’s a free 30-day trial if you don’t have one yet.)

However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Where to Buy: $359 $199 at Amazon $359 $199 at Best Buy $359.99 $199 at TargetSonos Ace The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review. Where to Buy: $399 $298.99 at Amazon $399 $299 at Best Buy $399 $299 at Sonos Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds are back down to $199 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches their most recent Prime Day low. The earbuds clip onto the back of your ear instead of inside it, so you can still clearly hear what’s happening around you in addition to your music. You sacrifice bass in the process, but the design is particularly good for runners who want to remain aware of their surroundings. They’re also comfortable to wear, provide a secure fit during workouts, and offer solid battery life. Read our review. You can get Nothing’s Headphones 1 for a new low of $254 ($46 off) at Amazon. The newer headphones feature a 1980s Walkman-like look, with transparent ear cups that show the components underneath. Our reviewer found them to be less fatiguing to wear than Sony’s over-ear headphones, and their ANC was capable of blocking out subway noises and other city sounds. They don’t support multipoint pairing, sadly, so they can only be connected to one device at a time. You also can’t use its 3.5mm headphone jack if the headphones’ battery is dead. Read our review. The Galaxy Buds FE, which offer a pared-down experience compared to the step-up Buds 3 Pro, are matching their all-time low of $54.99 ($45 off) at Amazon. For the price, you get decent sound, a comfortable design, and noise cancellation that performs relatively well. They also offer around six hours of battery life with ANC enabled. That said, they lack several notable features, including wireless charging and multipoint support, and only carry an IPX2 rating. Read our review. AirPods 4 Apple’s AirPods 4 are the latest update to the company’s base-model wireless earbuds. The hard, plastic buds feature improved audio over the third-gen model, along with deep iOS integration and spatial audio with head tracking. Read our review. Where to Buy: $129 $89 at Amazon $129 $89 at WalmartBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Bose’s headphones are a replacement for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 and offer a more travel-friendly design, spatial audio, better call quality, excellent comfort, and some of the best noise cancellation around. Read our review. Where to Buy: $429 $284 at Amazon $429 $330 at Target $429 $329 at Best BuySony WH-1000XM6 Sony’s latest pair of flagship headphones feature improved comfort, better noise cancellation, and the ability to charge while in use. They even fold down for travel, which can’t be said about the last-gen XM5. Read our initial impressions. Where to Buy: $449.99 $428 at Amazon $449.99 $428 at Best Buy $449.99 $429.99 at Target (with Circle) We can still enthusiastically recommend Sony’s WH-1000XM5 for anyone in need of a pair for travel, and they’re currently on sale for $298 ($100 off) at Amazon. The headphones feature a slim design, two processors for handling active noise cancellation, eight microphones (four for voice calls), and 30 hours of battery life with ANC enabled. They also sound excellent, with lots of detail and tight bass. They don’t fold down, though, so keep that in mind if you travel or commute with a smaller backpack. Read our review. If you don’t like the sealed feeling of silicone ear tips, the AirPods 4 with ANC are a great alternative that are currently matching their all-time low of $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The wireless earbuds feature an open-ear design and some of the AirPods Pro’s best features, including adaptive audio, conversation awareness, and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. Their ANC performs surprisingly well despite their open-style build, too, helping block low-frequency noise from airplane cabins and city traffic. Read our review. The Sennheiser IE 200 are on sale for $99.95 ($60 off) at Amazon, which is basically the same price we saw in July. Although the earbuds ditch Bluetooth for a more reliable wired connection, they still feature adjustable ear hooks and a detachable braided cable, which is easy to replace if it becomes worn out. A “dual-tunable” design also allows you to adjust the position of the ear tips, allowing you to fine-tune the sound profile depending on your preferences. The IE 200 don’t feature a built-in mic, though, which means they’re strictly for listening to music and podcasts. Read our review. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Significantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life. Read our review. Where to Buy: $229 $169.99 at Amazon $229 $189 at B&H Photo $229 $189 at Google StoreBose QuietComfort Earbuds (second-gen) Bose’s redesigned QuietComfort Earbuds deliver terrific active noise cancellation that outperforms most competitors. They also offer wireless charging and multipoint support right out of the box. Read hands-on impressions. Where to Buy: $179 $129 at Amazon $179 $129 at Best Buy $179 $129 at Bose The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are on sale at Amazon $74.99 ($55 off), matching their previous all-time low. The newer earbuds use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose, so they’re basically low-end Bose earbuds in disguise. That means you can expect a well-balanced sound, along with up to 40 hours of battery life, decent noise cancellation, and IPX4 water resistance. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are on sale for $179.99 ($70 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is similar to the price we saw during Amazon’s July Prime Day sale. Samsung’s flagship earbuds may not win any design awards, but they offer excellent sound quality, a crisp transparency mode, and useful hands-free voice support. While the earbuds offer decent sound and some great features, the active noise cancellation isn’t as robust as what you get from the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds Pro 2. Read our review. Amazon Echo Buds (2023) Amazon’s newest Echo Buds lack noise cancellation but feature a semi-open design that should make it easier to remain aware of your surroundings. They also integrate with Alexa and support multipoint pairing. Where to Buy: $49.99 $14.99 at AmazonAirPods Max (USB-C) Apple&#8217;s AirPods Max offer a premium metal design, excellent noise cancellation, a crystal-clear transparency mode, and intuitive controls. They were upgraded with a USB-C port in 2024. Read our original review.

It supports charging speeds of up to 45W via a USB-C port and features a USB-A port, which is sufficient for topping off earbuds and other small gadgets. Where to Buy: $32.99 $27.99 at Amazon $32.99 $28.05 at INIU (with code TasteMe15)Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top off a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. It also includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its 5-foot / 1.5m USB cable. Where to Buy: $149.99 $71.24 at Amazon $149.99 $74.99 at Twelve South $149.99 $71.24 at Best Buy If you don&#8217;t have an Apple Watch, Belkin’s MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand is a great alternative to the charger above, one that’s currently matching its all-time low of $54.99 ($45 off) at Amazon. It also supports 15W magnetic charging and features a smaller wireless pad on its base, allowing you to charge a pair of wireless earbuds. The magnetic pad on the top is tilted at an angle, too, making it easy to check your iPhone’s screen at a glance or start a video call. Twelve South’s 50W PlugBug, which features a pair of USB-C ports, is down to $38.99 ($31 off) at Amazon, matching its best price to date. The charger’s built-in support for Apple’s Find My network makes it a particularly good choice if you travel frequently and want to ensure you don’t accidentally leave your charger behind at an airport or hotel room. It’s also relatively compact, featuring foldable prongs and a slim profile that makes it easy to slip into your bag. Belkin USB-C to USB-C Cable These braided USB-C cables from Belkin are durable and support 100W charging speeds, allowing for quick charging of laptops, tablets, smartphones, and portable game consoles.

It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four. Where to Buy: $119.99 $89.99 at Amazon $119.99 $89.99 at Best Buy If you don’t mind toting around a slightly chunkier charger, Ugreen’s 100W Nexode Charger is another traveler-friendly option that’s marked down to $44.98 ($11 off) at Amazon. It’s outfitted with a 29.5-inch retractable cable — so you never have to worry about leaving your cord at home — along with two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, so you can charge up to three additional devices simultaneously. Ugreen Portable Charger (48K, 300W, 5-Port) Ugreen’s portable, 48,000mAh battery can charge a smartphone or tablet several times over; it also features an array of convenient ports and a nifty light strip on the side, which you can use during camping trips or anytime you power up your gadgets outside. Where to Buy: $169.99 $101.99 at Amazon $169.99 $101.99 at UgreenUgreen Uno Charger (65W, 3-Port) Ugreen’s 65W Uno charger features two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port, allowing you to charge three devices simultaneously. It also sports a quirky LED display that showcases different faces depending on the charging status. Where to Buy: $49.99 $32.99 at Amazon $49.99 $32.99 at Ugreen (Promo code: UL15570) Baseus’ Ultra-Slim Magnetic Power Bank, which is a cable-free way to charge your iPhone at up to 7.5W, is on sale at Amazon for $19.99 ($16 off), matching its all-time low. Its 20W USB-C port lets you take an iPhone’s battery from 0 to 55 percent in 30 minutes if you plug in using the included braided cable. Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 Jackery’s Explorer 1000 v2 can output up to 1,500W, which is enough to run a mini fridge or recharge a smartphone dozens of times.

It features a slim OLED display, offers up to three days of battery life, and can be easily detached from its band and clipped onto your clothes if you prefer not to wear it on your wrist. It can track your activity, heart rate, and sleep, though heart rate tracking is unavailable when it’s clipped on.

The Ace LTE lets a kid call or text a specified group of up to 20 contacts, while allowing parents to track their child’s location. However, you’ll need an active cellular subscription ($9.99 a month or $119.99 a year) to access calling, texting, and GPS functionality.

We found the Android watch to be comfortable and a solid all-around choice, thanks to its snappy performance. The single-day battery life was acceptable, although it can be extended by disabling the always-on display and GPS. Also, be aware that its sleep apnea tracking requires you to use it with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. Read our review.

The watch touts an OLED display, GPS tracking, and 120 sports modes with automatic recognition for accurately tracking your workouts. The Watch Pro 2 can track your activity, sleep patterns, heart rate, and blood oxygen level, and sync fitness data to the Apple Health or Google Health Connect app. CMF says the battery lasts up to 11 days, too, so you won’t have to think about charging it every night.

          "content": "On Tuesday, three physicists received the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on quantum mechanics in the 1980s. Researchers John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis created a circuit with no electrical resistance to demonstrate a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling, or how atoms and subatomic particles can move through a barrier material they shouldn’t be able to cross. It was all theory before Clarke, Devoret, and Martinis created the circuit. But their experiments demonstrated tunneling is possible in a physical circuit, which later led to modern transistors and the nascent quantum computing industry. &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking on my cell phone and I suspect that you are too, and one of the underlying reasons that the cell phone works is because of all this work,&#8221; Clarke said in a phone call to reporters at the Nobel ceremony. He said he was “completely stunned” to receive the award, Reuters reported. Clarke led the team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, where he began his professorship in 1969 and remains an emeritus professor. Over the decades, the trio’s early work expanded to form the basis of modern quantum computers. Both Martinis and Devoret researched quantum computing at Google. In 2019, Martinis, then hardware lead of Google’s Quantum AI team, and other researchers declared the creation of a computer with “quantum supremacy” far faster at solving a problem than the fastest supercomputer. He left the role at Google but is still a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara. Devoret is the chief scientist of quantum hardware at Google Quantum AI and a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The trio joins the rarified group of physicists worldwide to earn the highest scientific prize, including Max Planck in 1918 and Albert Einstein in 1921. Correction, October 7th: An earlier version of this article misstated the day the awards were announced. It was Tuesday, not Thursday.",

The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025. \"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. \"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\" When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.Read full article Comments",

Launching in more countries is “by far our number one request,” though the AltStore team is still waiting to hear more from Apple “on exact timing.” Testut also says that AltStore is making a big push into the fediverse by using the ActivityPub protocol to “federate apps, app updates, and news alerts from AltStore to the open social web.” Here’s how that will work, according to Testut: Each AltStore source will receive its own ActivityPub account, which can then be followed by any other open social web account. You’ll be able to like, boost, and reply to everything, and most importantly all these interactions will appear natively in AltStore. In other words, you’ll be able to comment on an app on Mastodon, like a news update on Threads, then open AltStore and view all these same interactions in-app. The AltStore team is working with Mastodon gGmbH to “manage a custom Mastodon server on our behalf” (it’s available in beta now) and with the non-profit A New Social to support Bluesky using the Bridgy Fed tool. The fediverse features will come to AltStore PAL in “the next few months,” Testut says. AltStore is also getting a $6 million investment from Patreon board member Chris Paik’s Pace Capital so the team can hire more staff and add “the necessary bandwidth to finalize Fediverse integration and expand AltStore worldwide,” Testut says. Paik will join AltStore’s board of directors, as will Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, who is a big fan of the fediverse.",

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale is underway, and a selection of highly-rated TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony and others are discounted for the occasion. If you can’t wait until Black Friday to upgrade, we’re rounding up the best Prime Day TV deals on the sets worth your time below. We’ve also thrown in a few discounts on streaming players we like. Just keep in mind that Amazon’s \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event runs through October 8, and you may need to be a Prime member to see some of the discounts. Best Prime Day TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED TV for $1,373 ($1,324 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED TV for $1,768 ($732 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Samsung The Frame (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $798 ($700 off): Samsung’s The Frame series has always been for people who care about their TV’s aesthetic more than its picture quality, since it’s designed to resemble a framed piece of wall art. It’s still overpriced for a TV with no local dimming or Dolby Vision HDR, but this deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, making it at least a little more reasonable. Other sizes are also on sale. Note that this deal is for the 2024 model — this year’s version is discounted as well, but its panel still isn’t great for the price. We’d recommend saving as much cash as possible if you really want one of these things. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-tv-deals-save-up-to-500-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051945.html?src=rss",

It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED TV for $1,373 ($1,324 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED TV for $1,768 ($732 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Samsung The Frame (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $798 ($700 off): Samsung’s The Frame series has always been for people who care about their TV’s aesthetic more than its picture quality, since it’s designed to resemble a framed piece of wall art. It’s still overpriced for a TV with no local dimming or Dolby Vision HDR, but this deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, making it at least a little more reasonable. Other sizes are also on sale. Note that this deal is for the 2024 model — this year’s version is discounted as well, but its panel still isn’t great for the price. We’d recommend saving as much cash as possible if you really want one of these things. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-tv-deals-save-up-to-500-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051945.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Believe it or not, October Prime Day is actually a good time to save on Dyson devices. Plenty of cordless vacuums are on sale this year, as well as a few viral hair stylers. But, none of those top my trusty AM09. Dyson’s Hot+Cool AM09 heater and fan is on sale for $300 right now — that’s 40 percent off and one of the best prices I’ve seen. My love for the AM09 is well documented. At this point, I’ve had it for more than five years and I bought it when it was $280 on super-sale at QVC. Previously, I had a Dyson tower fan that worked well until it kicked the bucket after a few years of use. I took the plunge with the AM09 because I generally had a great experience with the tower fan, and at the time, I had been living in apartments that were consistently chilly during wintertime and downright stifling during the summer months. Now, my house is not all that much different than my apartments of yesteryear — and my original AM09 is still kicking. It does a great job circulating air in the summer (it’s not an air conditioner, to be clear) and it cuts the chill in my particularly icy office during the winter. I love its handy fan, which attaches magnetically to the top of the fan so you don’t lose it and lets you control the fan speed and heater temperature with just a few presses of a button. But the real kicker with the AM09 is how lightweight it is: at just under six pounds, it’s incredibly easy to pick up and tote upstairs, downstairs or in the other room, wherever you need it the most. It has literally gone from my home office upstairs down to the main floor of my house and down again into our basement all in the same day for different purposes. Am I a little miffed that, in my impatience, I bought a discounted Dyson heater/fan/air purifier over the summer because I desperately wanted another AM09 and it wasn’t on sale at the time? Yes — but at least you, dear reader, can learn from my shopping woes and get the AM09 instead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/my-beloved-dyson-am09-heater-and-fan-is-40-percent-off-for-prime-day-223428328.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’re in the market for a new camera, drone or accessories, Amazon’s October Prime Day is proving to be a particularly good time to shop. You can find deals from major brands including DJI, Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and others. You’ll also see discounts on important accessories like memory cards, backpacks and tripods from the likes of LowePro and SanDisk. Many of these deals are on products that rarely go on sale, like DJI drones and Insta360 cameras, along with Canon, Nikon and Panasonic lenses. And you’ll see many products that appear in our most recent camera guide that are highly recommended by Engadget — so check that out as you add items to your cart. Now, dive in to see the best Prime Day camera deals you can find this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Polaroid Now 3rd-generation plus film for $136 (15 percent off): Polaroid is a name synonymous with instant cameras, and its Now model is the best choice for larger film. With this deal, you can grab one now with film for just $7 over the price of the camera without film. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. DJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. HoverAir X1 drone for $265 (34 percent off): The HoverAir X1 offers features like a folding, people-safe design, and up to 2.7K 30p HDR video. Unlike DJI’s Flip, it can dodge obstacles while tracking people, making it slightly better for that purpose. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $269 (21 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 5 Pro is a good alternative to GoPro's Hero 13 Black. It has a 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than its rival in low light and rivals it in battery life as well with over two hours while shooting in 4K 60p. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $359 (17 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. And if you want an even wider field of view, grab the Hero 13 Black Wide Edition for $329. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $799 (9 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Sony A6100 with 16-50mm and 55-210mm lenses $800 (33 percent off): If you want to hit the ground running with a camera and lenses on the cheap, Sony's A6100 is an outstanding value right now. While five years old, its autofocus system is still among the best thanks to its intelligent face- and eye-tracking, along with 4K 30 fps video. The color science and low-light capabilities are excellent, so photos are sharp and color accurate, even in dimly-lit environments. The drawbacks are bad rolling shutter and a low-resolution EVF. Still, you won't find much comparable in this price range with two lenses to boot. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $68 (24 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case. The mics weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. SmallRig Camera Tripod for $49 (30 percent off): This 2-in-1 tripod easily transforms into a monopod depending on your needs. It comes with a 360-degree detachable ball head, supports up to 33 pounds and lets you adjust the working height from 16- to 71-inches in seconds. Rode Wireless Micro for $99 (24 percent off): Another great wireless mic option is Rode's Wireless Micro designed for smartphone users. The receiver connects to the bottom of your smartphone via USB-C and the microphones attach to the subject via integrated clips or magnets. They capture pristine sound well above what your smartphone can do, with a 20-20 kHz frequency range and 73 dB signal-to-noise ratio. SanDisk 512GB Extreme Pro CFexpress Card Type B for $120 (24 percent off): If you need tons of storage for a newer camera with a CFexpress Type B slot, SanDisk's 512GB is a great deal. It can handle reading and writing at 1,700MB/s and 1,400MB/s respectively, enough speed for RAW video capture. Lowepro Flipside BP 300 AW III for $182 (24 percent off): The Flipside BP300 AW III is a rugged, lightweight bag that securely holds and protects your camera gear in the worst weather. It has rear access for protection and a special compartment to hold lenses. SmallRig AD-80 FreeBlazer video tripod for $175 (30 percent off): Weighing just 11.6 pounds, it supports up to a 17.6-pound load and expands from 34 to 75 inches with a one-step height adjustment. For smooth operation, it offers fluid head damping though 360-degree horizontal and +90°/-65° tilt. DJI Mic 2 for $269 (23 percent off): DJI's Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera like other mics, but also supports Bluetooth audio so can easily be connected to a smartphone as well. It picks up audio from your subject at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs. DJI RS 4 Mini $309 (16 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock. On top of that, the company introduced automatic tracking via its RS Intelligent Tracking Module to keep human subjects in frame no matter where they go. It also offers smoother gimbal tracking, longer battery life and faster charging. Lexar 128GB Professional 2000x SD Card $90 (31 percent off): If you need very fast SD UHS II memory, Lexar currently has an excellent deal on its 128GB 2000x memory card. It offers 300MB/s read and 260Mb/s write speeds, quick enough to capture high data rate video or bursts of high-resolution photos. Amazon is also offering a solid discount on 256GB memory in the same lineup at $170 or 23 percent off. Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $248 (17 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out. It offers beautiful bokeh and fast speeds in low light, but costs nearly half the price of f/1.4 models. Nikon Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 Lens $497 (17 percent off): If you want a fast 50mm portrait lens but don't have a ton to spend, Nikon's Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 lens is on sale for just $497, making it one of the cheapest full-frame options available. At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal.

          "content": "If you’re in the market for a new camera, drone or accessories, Amazon’s October Prime Day is proving to be a particularly good time to shop. You can find deals from major brands including DJI, Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and others. You’ll also see discounts on important accessories like memory cards, backpacks and tripods from the likes of LowePro and SanDisk. Many of these deals are on products that rarely go on sale, like DJI drones and Insta360 cameras, along with Canon, Nikon and Panasonic lenses. And you’ll see many products that appear in our most recent camera guide that are highly recommended by Engadget — so check that out as you add items to your cart. Now, dive in to see the best Prime Day camera deals you can find this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). Polaroid Now 3rd-generation plus film for $136 (15 percent off): Polaroid is a name synonymous with instant cameras, and its Now model is the best choice for larger film. With this deal, you can grab one now with film for just $7 over the price of the camera without film. DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. DJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. HoverAir X1 drone for $265 (34 percent off): The HoverAir X1 offers features like a folding, people-safe design, and up to 2.7K 30p HDR video. Unlike DJI’s Flip, it can dodge obstacles while tracking people, making it slightly better for that purpose. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $269 (21 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 5 Pro is a good alternative to GoPro's Hero 13 Black. It has a 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than its rival in low light and rivals it in battery life as well with over two hours while shooting in 4K 60p. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $359 (17 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. And if you want an even wider field of view, grab the Hero 13 Black Wide Edition for $329. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $799 (9 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Sony A6100 with 16-50mm and 55-210mm lenses $800 (33 percent off): If you want to hit the ground running with a camera and lenses on the cheap, Sony's A6100 is an outstanding value right now. While five years old, its autofocus system is still among the best thanks to its intelligent face- and eye-tracking, along with 4K 30 fps video. The color science and low-light capabilities are excellent, so photos are sharp and color accurate, even in dimly-lit environments. The drawbacks are bad rolling shutter and a low-resolution EVF. Still, you won't find much comparable in this price range with two lenses to boot. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $68 (24 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case.

          "title": "Google's AI can now surf the web for you, click on buttons, and fill out forms with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use",
          "standfirst": "Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into \"agents\" that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent (formerly known as \"Operator\") and Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use, both released over the last two years. Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM known as \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use,\" which can use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.\"These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an important next step in building general-purpose agents,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as part of a longer statement on the social network, X.The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.Instead, Google partnered with another company, Browserbase, founded by former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024, which offers virtual \"headless\" web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A \"headless\" browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \"Browser Arena\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform. The new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.Overall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.Brief User Hands-On TestsIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, \"The Life of A Showgirl.\"In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\") It did so in a matter of seconds.However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \"task competed\" message. I should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.Performance BenchmarksGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.Some highlights include:Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)WebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)AndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of accessOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.How It WorksAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 ProThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that. Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.",

They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 ProThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that. Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.",

          "title": "The best October Prime Day gaming deals: Save on PS5 games, headsets, controllers and more",
          "standfirst": "Among the many tech discounts included in Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale are several price drops on video games and other gaming gear. To make things a little less overwhelming, we've cut through the noise and rounded up the best Prime Day gaming deals we could find below. Just remember that some of the offers in Amazon's \"Prime Big Deal Days\" event, as it's officially called, are exclusive to Prime subscribers. The sale itself runs through October 8. Split Fiction (Xbox) for $25 ($25 off MSRP): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction is a imaginative crowd-pleaser that’s designed from the ground up to be played with another person. As in, you literally need a second person to play it. Like It Takes Two before it, it overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like commitment to presenting new methods of play. This deal for the Xbox copy represents the lowest price we’ve tracked, though the PS5 version is also on sale for $40 if you’d rather play there. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version. Metaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy. Madden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to. Astro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Backbone One (2nd gen) mobile game controller for $70 ($30 off): The Backbone One is a nifty mobile gamepad that wraps around your phone and makes playing console-style games feel a little more natural. This isn’t an all-time low for the second-gen model, but it’s a nice $30 dip from its usual street price. Both the USB-C and Lightning versions are discounted, with the latter down to $60. Just note that the PlayStation-branded version officially supports Sony’s Remote Play app on both Android and iOS, while the standard model only supports it with the latter. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off): The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March. ASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches. Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale. Crucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-gaming-deals-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623558.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best Prime Day speaker deals: JBL, Bose, Ultimate Ears and more",
          "standfirst": "We're always ready to argue that high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to music and dialogue that make any kind of entertainment more enjoyable. That said, they're not exactly cheap. That's why our staff audiophiles get so excited whenever Prime Day rolls around — it's an ideal time to sift through Amazon for Prime Day speaker deals on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable bluetooth speakers. This October Prime Day, our list of the best deals includes brands like Anker, Bose, JBL, Amazon Echo and more. So if you're ready to hear when your favorite TV actors are scratching themselves, let's get started. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $297 ($53 off): This deal isn't just the best way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love — it actually ships two Xtreme 2 units. If you place both strategically, you'll get a deep surround sound experience. Each Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Flip 6 for $100 ($30 off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $35 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 for $66 (34 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 may be our favorite UE product. At just 1.2 pounds, it can pump out mighty sound on its own, or chain with other UE speakers for a deeper full-range experience. USB charging is simple and lasts for 14 hours between top-ups. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 ($40 off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 ($100 off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Beats Pill for $50 (67 percent off): We gave the revived Beats Pill a full review last year, and we stand by our opinion that it was worth waiting for. Its newly enlarged subwoofer delivers much more powerful bass that sounds clean and lossless even over USB-C. The latest Pill also travels well, with 24 hours of battery life and IP67 waterproofing. This is technically the special edition Kim Kardashian crossover, though it's exactly the same. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Sonos Era 100 for $180 ($20 off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 ($100 off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). JBL Bar 700 for $700 ($200 off): Another 2023 drop, the JBL Bar 700 upgrades the Bar 300 by adding detachable wireless speakers for true 360-degree sound. While it costs twice as much as the 300, that money gets you more than four times the output, as the 700 tops out at 620 watts — and thanks to a 10-inch subwoofer, you'll feel all of it. Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 ($202 off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

          "content": "We're always ready to argue that high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to music and dialogue that make any kind of entertainment more enjoyable. That said, they're not exactly cheap. That's why our staff audiophiles get so excited whenever Prime Day rolls around — it's an ideal time to sift through Amazon for Prime Day speaker deals on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable bluetooth speakers. This October Prime Day, our list of the best deals includes brands like Anker, Bose, JBL, Amazon Echo and more. So if you're ready to hear when your favorite TV actors are scratching themselves, let's get started. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $297 ($53 off): This deal isn't just the best way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love — it actually ships two Xtreme 2 units. If you place both strategically, you'll get a deep surround sound experience. Each Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Flip 6 for $100 ($30 off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $35 (30 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound.

          "standfirst": "Sennheiser hasn’t debuted a premium set of wireless headphones since the Momentum 4 arrived in 2022. Sure, there were two sets of Accentum cans, but those offer more mid-range performance in the $180-$250 range. Instead of a Momentum 5 for its latest release, the company has revealed the HDB 630: a $500 set of wireless noise-canceling headphones that offer lossless listening via wired connection. If you’re thinking the HDB 630 looks an awful lot like the Momentum 4, you’re correct. Sennheiser says this new model “inherited” the chassis from those 2022 headphones, but there’s a new acoustic system inside for “focused listening.” That setup includes 42mm dynamic drivers what were “designed for purity, not hype.” As such, the company promises you’ll hear “the vibe that left the mastering studio” thanks to careful attention to the midrange, vocals and overall dynamics. Those drivers are supported by a high-resolution digital audio engine that works for both wired and wireless listening. Via either the USB-C or 3.5mm ports, you can expect to hear tunes in up to 24-bit/96kHz resolution. The HDB 630 also comes with a USB-C transmitter dongle for phones, tablets and other devices so that you can harness higher-quality listening with aptX Adaptive — even if your gadgets don’t support it natively. “With only an estimated 16 percent of smartphone hardware supporting native wireless high-res sound, the included dongle brings this capability to 80 percent of smartphone models in an instant through their USB Type-C port,” Sennheiser explained in a press release. There are several audio features available on the HDB 630 for an “audiophile” experience. First, Sennheiser employs the Crossfade feature from its HE 1 headphones that blends the left and right channels to make it seem like you’re listening to speakers. There’s also a new Parametric Equalizer for more granular EQ control, complete with bandwidth, filter and A/B settings. The company says any settings tweaks are then applied to the HDB 630’s “advanced processing system” so listeners determine the tuning rather than the content or app providing it. Lastly, users will soon have the ability to share presets via QR code. Another item Sennheiser retained from the Momentum 4 is long battery life. Like that model, the HDB 630 will last up to 60 hours with ANC enabled, so you won’t be reaching for a charging cable often. What’s more, a 10-minuted top up will give you seven hours of use. And when it’s time to travel, there’s an airline adapter included in the box. The HDB 630 is available for pre-order starting today for $499.95. Shipping is scheduled to begin October 21 from Sennhesier and other retailers.

          "title": "The best Prime Day vacuum deals: Save on machines from iRobot, Shark, Dyson and others",
          "standfirst": "This October Prime Day, we've collected a list of the best Amazon discounts on both traditional and robotic vacuums. We're hoping this article can do more than just save you money — it's also designed to help you with the fiddliest vacuum-related decisions. Should you go corded, cordless or robotic? Dyson, Tineco or Shark? Are there any decent robot vacuums that aren't Roombas? (Yes.) As the event goes on, we'll search for discounts as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best deals here. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 ($50 off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Dreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 ($60 off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 ($210 off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 ($100 off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Roborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 ($350 off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet. Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 ($500): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 ($70 off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 ($90 off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners. Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 ($230 off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $63 (10 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

As the event goes on, we'll search for discounts as tirelessly as an automated vacuum scours your floors for dirt, and post all the best deals here. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 ($50 off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Dreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 ($60 off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 ($210 off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 ($100 off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Roborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 ($350 off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet. Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 ($500): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 ($70 off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 ($90 off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners. Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 ($230 off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $63 (10 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference to intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to core operating system functions. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only do these Prime Day SSD deals cover some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 ($25 off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $112 ($38 off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s, plus a built-in heatsink and more efficient use of the device battery. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $370 (35 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $170 (48 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 ($30 off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. Best October Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 ($60 off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier. Best October Prime Day microSD card deals Samsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming. SanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $100 (33 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast.

          "standfirst": "You can snap up a lot of useful tech for less than $50 during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale. We’re seeing discounts on bluetooth trackers, mini speakers, earbuds, mice, power banks, wall chargers, and more. But this isn’t just random drek. The deals highlighted here are pulled from our own guides and reviews — gadgets and accessories we’ve tried ourselves and currently recommend. If you’re looking for small electronics and accessories so you can fill your Amazon cart for Prime Day without spending too much — this list of the best Prime Day deals under $50 is a great place to start. Best Prime Day deals under $50 Amazon Echo Buds for $15 ($35 off): We named these the best open-design pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They’re lightweight, have automatic wear detection and built-in assistance from Alexa. Just remember an open ear design blocks no noise and the battery life here isn’t the most robust. This Lightning deal matches the all-time low but is set to expire in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. Beats Pill for $50 ($100 off with Prime): Here’s one of our picks for best portable Bluetooth speakers. Only the Kim Kardashian version in light or dark grey is on sale, but other than the marketing they’re the same speaker as the other Beats Pills. Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Elgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling. INIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. —> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off with Prime): Our favorite Bluetooth tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. It’s got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apple’s networks). Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Blink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. —> Want spend no more than $25 on this sale? Check out our list of the super cheap stuff. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. OtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Ultimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Twelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake. —> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's gaming deals roundup. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Moft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",
          "content": "You can snap up a lot of useful tech for less than $50 during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale. We’re seeing discounts on bluetooth trackers, mini speakers, earbuds, mice, power banks, wall chargers, and more. But this isn’t just random drek. The deals highlighted here are pulled from our own guides and reviews — gadgets and accessories we’ve tried ourselves and currently recommend. If you’re looking for small electronics and accessories so you can fill your Amazon cart for Prime Day without spending too much — this list of the best Prime Day deals under $50 is a great place to start. Best Prime Day deals under $50 Amazon Echo Buds for $15 ($35 off): We named these the best open-design pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They’re lightweight, have automatic wear detection and built-in assistance from Alexa. Just remember an open ear design blocks no noise and the battery life here isn’t the most robust. This Lightning deal matches the all-time low but is set to expire in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. Beats Pill for $50 ($100 off with Prime): Here’s one of our picks for best portable Bluetooth speakers. Only the Kim Kardashian version in light or dark grey is on sale, but other than the marketing they’re the same speaker as the other Beats Pills. Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Elgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling. INIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. —> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off with Prime): Our favorite Bluetooth tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. It’s got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apple’s networks). Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Blink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. —> Want spend no more than $25 on this sale? Check out our list of the super cheap stuff. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. OtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Ultimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Twelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable.

The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake. —> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's gaming deals roundup. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon.

You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time.

          "standfirst": "Forget iPads and TVs. This list is all about the best Prime Day deals you can buy for less than $25. There’s a surprising number of deals on Amazon’s site for gadgets, accessories and small electronics that we’ve tested and recommend. If you’re looking for mini speakers to keep you company by the fire pit, a new cable that won’t conk out on you or a smart plug to control your Halloween lights, check out this list. We’ve linked to our buying guides and reviews so you can read up on a product before plunking down your hard-earned (but less than 25) dollars. Here are Engadget’s picks for the best Prime Day tech deals under $25. The best Prime Day deals under $25 Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our current top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17 ($13 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours. Amazon Basics Smart LED Light Bulb for $9 ($3 off with Prime): We didn’t test this one for our smart bulb guide, but it’s tough to argue with this price — and I’ve found the smart plug equivalent of this device to be one of the more reliable bits of smart home tech I’ve tried. Like all Amazon smart home gear, this only works with Alexa devices like an Echo speaker (and any smartphone). Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Thermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $19 ($16 off): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-tech-deals-under-25-save-on-blink-anker-roku-and-fire-tv-084136589.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Forget iPads and TVs. This list is all about the best Prime Day deals you can buy for less than $25. There’s a surprising number of deals on Amazon’s site for gadgets, accessories and small electronics that we’ve tested and recommend. If you’re looking for mini speakers to keep you company by the fire pit, a new cable that won’t conk out on you or a smart plug to control your Halloween lights, check out this list. We’ve linked to our buying guides and reviews so you can read up on a product before plunking down your hard-earned (but less than 25) dollars. Here are Engadget’s picks for the best Prime Day tech deals under $25. The best Prime Day deals under $25 Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our current top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events.

          "standfirst": "New gear can make cooking easier (and sometimes more fun) but the best kitchen tech isn’t cheap. That’s why it’s a good idea to wait for a sale like Amazon's Prime Day. At Engadget, we’ve tested plenty of kitchen gear (and have opinions to accompany said testing) so we searched for discounts on what we actually recommend. We found deals on some of our preferred brands like air fryers from Breville, Instant Pot cookers, coffee makers and even a Ninja ice cream machine. We’ve linked to our testing and reviews so you can get the information you need before you buy. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find.. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Fellow Aiden Precision Drip Coffee Maker for $320 ($80 off): Fellow gear shows up again and again in our guide for coffee lovers and we gave this particular machine a review score of 91 upon its debut in late 2024. It’s an automatic drip coffee machine that actually delivers on its promise of making hands-free pour-over coffee. KitchenAid Artisan Series Stand Mixer for $379 ($121 off): There’s a reason this is so popular among home bakers and chefs. The Artisan KitchenAid is sort of the gold standard stand mixer, as we point out in our guide to the best kitchen tech. This isn’t an all-time low (it was $350 as recently as May), but matches the July Prime Day price. Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40 off with Prime): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off with Prime): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker $180 ($50 off): This is one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the Creami dipped down to $160 last Black Friday but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Meater Pro wireless thermometer for $99 ($31 off): This was previously called the Meater 2 Plus, but the company changed the name. We gave it high praise in our review, and like the extended range, strong battery life, durability and precision. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $144 ($36 off with Prime): This is one of the appliances we recommend in our guide for tea gifts. I bought one based on that suggestion and have been impressed with this little kettle’s speed and good looks ever since. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Ooni Koda 16 Gas Pizza Oven for $520 ($129 off): Ooni dominates our list of the best pizza ovens. The Koda can run on a propane tank or natural gas line and heats up to 950 degrees in just 20 minutes. Plus its big capacity can cook a 16-inch pizza in around one minute. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off with Prime): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off with Prime): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July. Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-193009814.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Prime Day is a good time to consider picking up one of Amazon's own devices, particularly Kindle ereaders. Amazon typically saves the best discounts for its shopping events, and this year is no different. One of the standouts is the Kindle Colorsoft, which is on sale for $200. That's $50 off and a record low for the 16GB model. The cost was one of the only real detractions we found in our review of Amazon's long-awaited color screen ereader, which has a bunch of nice features. The warm light of the screen is adjustable so that you can read easily in different lighting conditions, and there are no ads on the lock screen. If you're reading a lot of comics or manga, you'll likely appreciate both the color screen and the Colorsoft's pinch-to-zoom feature. Amazon says the Colorsoft can last up to eight weeks on a single battery charge, and it's waterproof in case you want to bring it to the beach or the pool (or if you just don't want to risk ruining it if you knock over your water bottle). Colorsoft isn't the only Amazon ereader that's on sale for Prime Day. The standard Kindle model is currently available for $85, down from its usual $110 cost. You can also pick up a Kindle Paperwhite for $125, discounted from $160.

          "content": "Prime Day is a good time to consider picking up one of Amazon's own devices, particularly Kindle ereaders. Amazon typically saves the best discounts for its shopping events, and this year is no different. One of the standouts is the Kindle Colorsoft, which is on sale for $200. That's $50 off and a record low for the 16GB model. The cost was one of the only real detractions we found in our review of Amazon's long-awaited color screen ereader, which has a bunch of nice features. The warm light of the screen is adjustable so that you can read easily in different lighting conditions, and there are no ads on the lock screen. If you're reading a lot of comics or manga, you'll likely appreciate both the color screen and the Colorsoft's pinch-to-zoom feature. Amazon says the Colorsoft can last up to eight weeks on a single battery charge, and it's waterproof in case you want to bring it to the beach or the pool (or if you just don't want to risk ruining it if you knock over your water bottle). Colorsoft isn't the only Amazon ereader that's on sale for Prime Day. The standard Kindle model is currently available for $85, down from its usual $110 cost. You can also pick up a Kindle Paperwhite for $125, discounted from $160. Both of these options made our ranking of the best ereaders, with the Kindle winning our recommendation for an entry-level option and the Kindle Paperwhite impressing us as the best premium pick.

Bose is one of the top players in this space, and you can save on some of its high-end wireless headphones for Prime Day. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are $100 off right now and down to $329. Note that this deal applies to the previous generation QuietComfort Ultra, rather than the refreshed second-gen model Bose has just announced. These offer improved battery life, ANC and audio performance, and they also support lossless audio over a wired USB-C connection for the first time. However, these headphones also cost $449 out of the gate, which is considerably more than the heavily slashed price of their predecessor. If you don’t have to have the latest and greatest in every product line, the first-gen QuietComfort Ultra will be more than enough for the vast majority of people. They still offer exceptional noise-canceling, very good sound and a comfortable design. Bose’s “Immersive Audio” spatial sound feature can be a bit hit and miss, but with the right content it can be incredible. And while $329 is still a lot of money, $100 is a big saving on what were very recently the best Bose headphones you can buy.

          "title": "The best fast chargers for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Fast chargers have become essential as phones, tablets and even laptops demand more power to keep up with daily use. Many new devices no longer include a charger in the box, so finding the best fast charger for you is important if you want reliable speed without damaging your battery. A good charger saves you time, keeps your devices powered during busy days and often supports multiple gadgets at once.The best fast charger options now go beyond smartphones. Tablets like the iPad Pro, foldables such as the Galaxy Z Fold series and laptops with USB-C charging all benefit from higher wattage and newer standards like USB-C PD and GaN. Some models are compact enough to fit in your pocket, while others have several ports so you can power a laptop, phone and earbuds at the same time.With so many different devices and charging standards, choosing the best fast charger depends on your setup and how you use it. This guide breaks down our top picks to help you find the right match for your gear. Best fast chargers for 2025 What to consider before buying a fast charger Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating. Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery. For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear. Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds. Fast charger FAQs What is GaN? When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages. Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way. Do fast chargers affect battery life? Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible. What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger? There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

One of the best deals in this space is on Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2, which are down to $170. That's $60 off their usual $230 price, and a pretty great deal for a pair of wireless buds that rival Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are compact wireless earbuds with a touch-sensitive surface and a small circular ring in the back to help them stay in your ears. You can currently purchase the buds in bluish-gray \"Moonstone,\" off-white \"Porcelain,\" pink \"Peony\" or light black \"Hazel\" color options, but whichever you choose, you'll get solid active noise cancellation and a collection of other helpful audio features. In terms of ANC, Engadget's review of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 found that the earbuds do a good job of blocking out \"low-to-mid-range noise\" but still struggle to block out nearby voices. On the whole, though, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 sounds better than Google's previous wireless earbuds, particularly when you're listening bass-forward tracks. The capabilities of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 extend beyond just listening to music, of course. Like its competitors, Google has turned its wireless earbuds into hearing protection, too. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 were recently updated to support what Google calls Loud Noise Protection, which can reduce incoming loud noises to protect your ears. That's on top of features like Adaptive Audio, which can adjust noise cancellation and volume based on your surroundings, and Talk to Gemini Live, which gives you a hands-free way to have a free-flowing conversation with Google's AI chatbot. There might be other earbuds that offer better audio performance, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is the best option if you're on Android and want a seamless experience.

The Galaxy S25 is a mix of old and new. The phone largely looks like the Galaxy S24, but comes in new colors and a slightly thinner frame. It uses the same bright 6.2-inch, 120Hz AMOLED screen, but is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.

In terms of battery life, the Galaxy S24 already started out strong at around 24 hours, but the Galaxy S25 goes a good bit past that with an additional four hours. That gives you more time for calls or watching videos — one of the tangible benefits of a power-efficient 3nm Qualcomm chip. That performance also shines when it comes with AI. Samsung offers its own collection of Galaxy AI features, like the less-than-useful Now Brief and AI photo editing, but it's also just a good vehicle for Gemini.

          "standfirst": "For more than a decade, conversational AI has promised human-like assistants that can do more than chat. Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people outside of chat. Even the best AI models score only in the 30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard, a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks like TAU-Bench airline, which measures the reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights on behalf of a user, also don&#x27;t have much higher pass rates, with only 56% for the top performing agents and models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time. New York City-based Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc., co-founded by Ohad Elhelo and Ori Cohen, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably. The company’s new foundation model, called Apollo-1 — which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.It&#x27;s a hybrid architecture championed by even LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”AUI defines certainty as the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does. For example, on TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and posted on AUI&#x27;s website.Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. “Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet The Information, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. From Pattern Matching to Predictable ActionThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the next action in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a typed symbolic state.Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”A Foundation Model for Task ExecutionUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a foundation model for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a System Prompt.“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.Eight Years in the MakingAUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating procedural knowledge — steps, constraints, and flows — from descriptive knowledge like entities and attributes.“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over 90 percent task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with 60 percent for Claude-4. It completed 83 percent of live booking chats on Google Flights versus 22 percent for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and 91 percent of retail scenarios on Amazon versus 17 percent for Rufus.“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”A Complement, Not a CompetitorAUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. AUI has also confirmed a strategic partnership with Google and plans for general availability in November 2025, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”Toward Conversations That ActFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.",

Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people outside of chat. Even the best AI models score only in the 30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard, a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users.

          "standfirst": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, October Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have been the same or even better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For October Prime Day 2025, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best October Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more. Prime Day Kindle deals Kindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate. Kindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration. Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life. Kindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. Prime Day Echo deals Echo Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. Echo Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy. Echo Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals. Echo Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services. Prime Day Fire TV deals Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie. Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something. Fire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console. Prime Day Fire tablet deals Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more. Fire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case.

          "standfirst": "You may not be looking to spend big on tech this October Prime Day, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it. For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "The entry-level Apple iPad with the A16 chip is on sale for $280 as a Prime Day promotion. This is a discount of around $70 and represents a record-low price for the 11-inch tablet. The deal is available in multiple colorways and is one of the best Apple deals for Prime Day this year. This tablet made our list of the best iPads and we particularly recommend it for the budget-conscious. It may lack some of the bells and whistles of its more expensive cousins, but it still gets the job done. It's fast enough for most common tasks and the battery life is solid, at 10 hours per charge. It also ships with 6GB of RAM, which is a decent enough metric. The tablet integrates with Wi-Fi 6 and features a USB-C connector, along with a pair of 12MP cameras. There's also a Touch ID sensor, which can be used to unlock the device and to make payments. This is the most basic tablet in Apple's lineup, so it lacks some features. It doesn't integrate with the Apple Pencil Pro or the Magic Keyboard. The display is also not quite as gorgeous as the iPad Air or Pro, but it's still a Liquid Retina panel. Elsewhere among the Apple deals for Prime Day, you can get $150 off the iPad Air — both the 11-inch model and the 13-inch model.

          "standfirst": "If your laptop simply isn’t cutting it anymore, October Prime Day might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant for Amazon's Big Deal Days, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t know how to figure out if that laptop you’re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale. That’s where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you’re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 (17 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Dell Inspiron 3530 laptop (15-inch, Core i3) for $284 (29 percent off) Acer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Lenovo LOQ laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i7) for $780 (34 percent off) Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,180 (16 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver. Lenovo Chromebook Duet 2025 (11-inch, MediaTek Kompanio 838) for $210 (34 percent off) HP HD Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Pentium N200) for $319 (9 percent off) Acer Chromebook Plus (14-inch, Intel Core i3) for $360 (10 percent off) This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-laptop-deals-discounts-on-machines-from-apple-lenovo-dell-hp-and-more-130507738.html?src=rss",

It's not a huge discount, but it matches the best price we've seen these cans drop to since they debuted earlier this year. The WH-1000XM6 takes a leap forward in sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC) and other features. Our audio reviewer, Billy Steele, called them the best headphones you can buy right now. \"The crown is safe once again,\" he wrote. \"Sony has managed to overhaul its flagship headphones in all the right ways that keep the 1000X line atop our best headphones list.\" The XM6 has a powerful new chip, the QN3, that unlocks much of its potential. Sony also developed new drivers for this model, resulting in richer details, clearer vocals and a better overall balance. The headphones added four extra microphones to enhance ANC. The XM6 is especially improved at blocking out voices. If you're a fan of spatial effects, which simulate a wider soundstage, Sony added that for this generation. The (optional) 360 Spatial Sound feature transforms regular stereo content into something with a surround-sound effect. It's similar to what Apple and Bose have in their models. It's yet another audio effect option in Sony's app, alongside 360 Reality Audio and DSEE Extreme upscaling. The headphones are no slouch in the battery life department. The XM6 is rated for up to 30 hours with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off. In Engadget's testing, we had no problem hitting those advertised figures. If you'd rather save more money for a lesser (but still great) pair of cans, Sony's last-gen model is also on sale. You can get the WH-1000XM5 for $100 off. The 2022 flagship headphones offer premium sound, ANC, and battery life. Typically $400, you can get them during October Prime Day for $298.

One of the best deals you can get is on the Sonos Era 100: pick one up for $179 during the sale, which is a good bit cheaper than its original price of $219. We reviewed the Era 100 and came away impressed, saying that it provides \"affordable multi-room audio that actually sounds good.\" This model replaced the Sonos One speaker and it's an improvement on that design in every major way. The sound quality is great and it gets plenty loud for get-togethers and the like. The design is simple and attractive and there's both Bluetooth and line-in support. It includes built-in mics for Trueplay tuning and works with just about every music streaming service. It's a good little speaker. While it's easy to recommend this unit, there are a couple of little caveats. It doesn't offer voice support for Google Assistant, though it does integrate with Alexa and the company's proprietary voice assistant. Also, this is a single speaker so there's no real stereo separation. The company is also discounting the Beam 2 soundbar from $463 all the way down to $370. That's a savings of nearly $100.

For example, when Apple comes out with new Apple Watches in September, you can usually get the previous generation for less for a while. Prime Day deals have brought such discounts: the Apple Watch Series 10 is on sale for $279, a record low for this model. This particular deal applies to the 42mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 10 in a variety of color options. And while it is no longer Apple’s flagship smartwatch, with the Series 11 succeeding it last month, it was comfortably our top pick for the best smartwatch until that arrived. Considering its regular list price starts at $399 (the same as the 42mm Series 11), you’re saving some serious cash if you opt for the older device. In our 90-scoring review, we warned any Series 8 or 9 Apple Watch owners that the Series 10 was a fairly unspectacular iterative update, but for first-time buyers or people looking to upgrade from an older model, it’s very easy to recommend. Its larger display makes it easier to check notifications than on previous Apple Watches, while the thinner frame means it looks nicer too. The former flagship Apple Watch unsurprisingly excels at health and fitness tracking, and the blood oxygen app that Apple was forced to remove when the watch launched is now available again after a redesign.

          "standfirst": "Prime Day is a great time to consider a new vacuum. Whether you have a bulky upright or an aging cordless vacuum, there are plenty of deals to choose from this time around. One of the best is on the Dyson V8 Plus, which you can pick up for $300 or 44 percent off. The Dyson V8 Plus is the same basic vacuum as the original V8, just with a wider selection of accessories that should ideally make it even more essential to your cleaning routine. The Dyson V8 Plus has 115AW of suction, and a 40-minute run time that should give you more than enough flexibility to clean a small home or apartment. Dyson also says the vacuum's filter can capture 99.9 percent of dust, particles and allergens. Like some of Dyson's other stick vacuums, the Dyson V8 Plus can work in handheld mode when you need to get in the crevices of couch cushions or shelves. It's also designed to easily empty dust and debris directly into a trash can without having to unscrew its filter. In terms of accessories, purchasing the V8 Plus gets you the main \"Motorbar\" cleaner head, a hair screw attachment for untangling long hairs, a mini soft dusting brush for sweeping off flat surfaces and a crevice tool for getting into small spaces. The Dyson V8 Plus, while good, isn't on Engadget's best cordless vacuums list, but a pick from the list is on sale for Prime Day. You can get the Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 during Amazon's sale, a not insignificant discount on a vacuum that's typically sold for more than $800. The Dyson V15 Detect Plus offers 240AW of suction in comparison to the V8 Plus' 115AW, and it can run for 60 minutes on a single charge, giving you even more time to clean. You'll also get more accessories in comparison to Dyson's other vacuum. On top of the usual suspects like the hair screw tool and the mini dusting brush, the V15 Detect Plus also supports the company's \"Fluffy Optic\" cleaner head, which uses a built-in light to reveal hidden dust and hair.

You'll also get more accessories in comparison to Dyson's other vacuum. On top of the usual suspects like the hair screw tool and the mini dusting brush, the V15 Detect Plus also supports the company's \"Fluffy Optic\" cleaner head, which uses a built-in light to reveal hidden dust and hair.

          "standfirst": "The Google Pixel 9a is our top pick for the best midrange phone on the market right now. It's a great value at $499, but when it's $150 off like it is for Amazon Prime Day, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better smartphone in this price range. You can pick it up for only $349 during the sale, or step up to either the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, which both are on sale for the first time. The Pixel 9a may lack the cutting-edge sizzle of ultra-premium phones that cost triple what you'll pay here. But in return, you get strong performance, a sleek design, a robust battery that lasts over 28 hours and camera quality that rivals that of competitors costing $1,000 or more. The phone has a simple design with an aluminum frame and a recycled polycarbonate back. It has an IP68 rating for solid protection against dust and water. On the front, you have a spacious 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The screen's brightness can reach an impressive 2,700 nits, matching the standard Pixel 9. Its resolution is a crisp 1080 x 2424 (422 PPI). In Engadget's tests, the Pixel 9a's camera \"preserved more details and produced a generally better-looking image\" than the Galaxy S25 Ultra's. (If you aren't familiar, that's a $1,300 phone.) The Pixel 9a does lack a dedicated telephoto lens. But Google has included the Super Res Zoom AI upscaling feature to help compensate for the loss. Amazon's deal includes all four colors available for the phone: obsidian, porcelain, peony and iris. There's no guarantee stock will last through all of October Prime Day, so you may want to consider pouncing soon if this deal is for you. Also on sale are the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, which you can pick up for $$649 and $799, respectively.

          "standfirst": "Those on a tight budget and those who prefer open-ear AirPods will want to check out the latest discount on the AirPods 4. Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are down to $90 for October Prime Day, or 30 percent off their normal rate. That's also the lowest we've seen them, and one of the best Prime Day Apple deals you can get. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $120 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway. There are plenty of other Apple deals to be had this Prime Day, and there are a few more worthy AirPods deals we've collected below.

          "standfirst": "Anker has a bunch of new Prime charging devices available and some of them are already getting solid discounts. The lineup includes a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W). Prime members can currently get $60 off the portable battery, bringing it down to $170. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs — the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger — which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously — also has a $58 discount to $172 . While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is $40 off too, now down to $110. Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.

The Roomba 104 integrates with the company's proprietary app, which allows for custom cleaning schedules and the like. The robot can also be controlled via voice assistant and boasts compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. The vacuum will automatically head to the charger for some juice when running low, which is nice. The battery lasts around 200 minutes per charge, which is a decent enough metric for a budget-friendly robovac. The only downside here? This is just a vacuum.

The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.IBM and Anthropic co-created \"A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers,\" focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agentsIn addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the \"prototype to production chasm.\"\"Today, there&#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,\" Aziza said. \"Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:Agent lifecycle framework: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.Integrated AI governance: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.Enterprise infrastructure: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.No-code and pro-code options: Langflow is \"low-code.\" IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.Pre-built domain agents: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.Production observability: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governingIBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the \"brittle scripts\" problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.What this means for enterprisesTechnical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments. Project Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes. You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future.

          "standfirst": "You’ve probably been tempted to jump on the air-fryer bandwagon in recent months and, if you have not yet taken the plunge, we’re here to help. Like the ubiquitous Instant Pot that came before it, air fryers have surged in popularity as of late, promising extra crispy foods of all kinds without the mess and danger of a big vat of hot oil. These small appliances come in all shapes and sizes now and they can be a versatile addition to your kitchen, so long as you know what they are (and aren’t) capable of. For those who are still deciding on which kind of air fryer is right for them, our guide can demystify the space for you and highlight some of the best air fryers you can get right now. Our current favorite is the Instant Vortex Plus air fryer, but there are a number of others we like that may better suit your lifestyle. Table of contents What does an air fryer do? Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Air fryer pros and cons Best air fryer accessories How to clean an air fryer How to find air fryer recipes How we test air fryers What does an air fryer do? Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal. For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch. Read more: We’ve also rounded up the best pizza ovens and the best sous vide machines. Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Convection ovens You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed. You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition. The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own. Pod-shaped air fryers Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything. That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher. Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them. Air fryer pros and cons Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines. One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking. Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later. With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options. There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking. There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs. You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer! Best air fryer accessories Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. Tongs are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These silicone mats will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers. They have holes to ensure the heated air is still able to circulate around the food. Silicone trivets are also useful for resting any cooked food on while you sort out the rest of the meal. And if you find yourself needing oil spray, but don’t feel like repeatedly buying tiny bottles, you can decant your favorite vegetable oil into a permanent mister like this. How to clean an air fryer We’re keeping clean up simple here. Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely. Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done. Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us. Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides. If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry. How to find air fryer recipes Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however. Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from Delish, which also has a handy air fryer time converter for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. BBC Good Food is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is NYT Cooking, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer. And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it. How we test air fryers We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything. That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher. Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them. Air fryer pros and cons Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines. One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking. Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later. With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options. There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking. There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs. You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer! Best air fryer accessories Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. Tongs are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These silicone mats will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers. They have holes to ensure the heated air is still able to circulate around the food. Silicone trivets are also useful for resting any cooked food on while you sort out the rest of the meal. And if you find yourself needing oil spray, but don’t feel like repeatedly buying tiny bottles, you can decant your favorite vegetable oil into a permanent mister like this. How to clean an air fryer We’re keeping clean up simple here. Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely. Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done. Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us. Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides. If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry. How to find air fryer recipes Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however. Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from Delish, which also has a handy air fryer time converter for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. BBC Good Food is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is NYT Cooking, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer. And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it. How we test air fryers We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI launched an agent builder that the company hopes will eliminate fragmented tools and make it easier for enterprises to utilize OpenAI’s system to create agents. AgentKit, announced during OpenAI’s DevDay in San Francisco, enables developers and enterprises to build agents and add chat capabilities in one place, potentially competing with platforms like Zapier. By offering a more streamlined way to create agents, OpenAI advances further into becoming a full-stack application provider.“Until now, building agents meant juggling fragmented tools—complex orchestration with no versioning, custom connectors, manual eval pipelines, prompt tuning, and weeks of frontend work before launch,” the company said in a blog post. AgentKit includes:Agent Builder, which is a visual canvas where devs can see what they’ve created and versioning multi-agent workflowsConnector Registry is a central area for admins to manage connections across OpenAI products. A Global Admin console will be a prerequisite to using this feature.ChatKit enables users to integrate chat-based agents into their user interfaces. Eventually, OpenAI said it will build a standalone Workflows API and add agent deployment tabs to ChatGPT. OpenAI also expanded evaluation for agents, adding capabilities such as datasets with automated graders and annotations, trace grading that runs end-to-end assessments of workflows, automated prompt optimization, and support for third-party agent measurement tools. Developers can access some features of AgentKit, but OpenAI is gradually rolling out additional features, such as Agent Builder. Currently, Agent Builder is available in beta, while ChatKit and new evaluation capabilities are generally available. Connector Registry “is beginning its beta rollout to some API and ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users. OpenAI said pricing for AgentKit tools will be included in the standard API model pricing. Agent BuilderTo clarify, many agents are built using OpenAI’s models; however, enterprises often access GPT-5 through other platforms to create their own agents. However, AgentKit brings enterprises more into its ecosystem, ensuring they don’t need to tap other platforms as often. Demonstrated during DevDay, the company stated that Agent Builder is ideal for rapid iteration. It also provides developers with visibility into how the agents are working. During the demo, an OpenAI developer made an agent that reads the DevDay agenda and suggests panels to watch. It took her just under eight minutes. Other model providers saw the importance of offering developer toolkits to build agents to entice enterprises to use more of their tools. Google came out with its Agent Development Kit in April, expanding multi-agent system building “in under 100 lines of code.” Microsoft, which runs the popular agent framework AutoGen, announced it is bringing agent creation to one place with its new Agent Framework.OpenAI customers, such as the fintech company Ramp, stated in a blog post that its teams were able to build a procurement agent in a few hours instead of months. “Agent Builder transformed what once took months of complex orchestration, custom code, and manual optimizations into just a couple of hours. The visual canvas keeps product, legal, and engineering on the same page, slashing iteration cycles by 70% and getting an agent live in two sprints rather than two quarters,” Ramp said. AgentKit’s Connector Registry would also enable enterprises to manage and maintain data across workspaces, consolidating data sources into a single panel that spans both ChatGPT and the API. It will have pre-built connectors to Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. It also supports third-party MCP servers. Another capability of Agent Builder is Guardrails, an open-source safety layer that protects against the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), jailbreaks, and unintended or malicious behavior.Bringing more chat Since most agentic interactions involve chat, it makes sense to simplify the process for developers to set up chat interfaces and connect them with the agents they’ve just built. “Deploying chat UIs for agents can be surprisingly complex—handling streaming responses, managing threads, showing the model thinking and designing engaging in-chat experiences,” OpenAI said. The company said ChatKit makes it simple to embed chat agents on platforms and embed these into apps or websites. However, some OpenAI competitors have begun thinking beyond the chatbot and want to offer agentic interactions that feel more seamless. Google’s asynchronous coding agent, Jules, has introduced a new feature that enables users to interact with the agent through the command-line interface, eliminating the need to open a chat window. Responses The response to AgentKit has mainly been positive, with some developers noting that while it simplifies agent building, it doesn’t mean that everyone can now build agents. Several developers view Agent Kit not as a Zapier killer, but rather as a tool that complements the pipeline. Zapier debuted a no-code tool for building AI agents and bots, called Zapier Central, in 2024.",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI&#x27;s annual conference for third-party developers, DevDay, kicked off with a bang today as co-founder and CEO Sam Altman announced a new \"Apps SDK,\" or software development kit, that makes it \"possible to build apps inside of ChatGPT,\" including paid apps, which companies can charge users for using OpenAI&#x27;s recently unveiled Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). In other words, instead of launching apps one-by-one on your phone, computer, or on the web — now you can do all that without ever leaving ChatGPT. This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or ask Coursera about a specific lesson&#x27;s content while dit plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offering their own connections (see below).\"This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with,\" Altman said.While the Apps SDK is available today in preview, OpenAI said it would not begin accepting new apps within ChatGPT or allow them to charge users until \"later this year.\"ChatGPT in-line app access is already rolling out to ChatGPT Free, Plus, Go and Pro users — outside of the European Union only for now — with Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers expected to receive access to the apps later this year.Built atop common MCP standardBuilt on the open source standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by rival Anthropic nearly a year ago, the Apps SDK gives third-party developers working independently or on behalf of enterprises large and small to connect selected data, \"trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI [user interface]\" Altman explained during his introductory keynote speech. The Apps SDK includes a \"talking to apps\" feature that allows ChatGPT and the underlying GPT-5 or other \"o-series\" models piloting it underneath to obtain updated context from the third-party app or service, so the model \"always knows about exactly what you&#x27;re user is interacting with,\" according to another presenter and OpenAI engineer, Alexi Christakis.Developers can build apps that:appear inline in chat as lightweight cards or carouselsexpand to fullscreen for immersive tasks like maps, menus, or slidesuse picture-in-picture for live sessions such as video, games, or quizzesEach mode is designed to preserve ChatGPT’s minimal, conversational flow while adding interactivity and brand presence.Early integrations with Coursera, Canva, Zillow and more...Christakis showed off early integrations of external apps built atop the Apps SDK, including ones from e-learning company Coursera, cloud design software company Canva, and real estate listings and agent connections search engine, Zillow.Altman also announced Apps SDK integrations with additional partners not demoed officially during the keynote including: Booking.com, Expedia, Figma and Spotify and in documentation, said more upcoming partners are on deck: AllTrails, Peloton, OpenTable, Target, theFork, and Uber, representing lifestyle, commerce, and productivity categories.The Coursera demo included an example of how the user onboards to the external app, including a new login screen for the app (Coursera) that appears within the ChatGPT chat interface, activated simply by a text prompt from the user asking: \"Coursera can you teach me something about machine learning\"?Once logged in, the app launched within the chat interface, \"in line\" and can render anything from the web, including interactive elements like video. Christakis explained and showed the Apps SDK also supports \"picture-in-picture\" and \"fullscreen\" views, allowing the user to choose how to interact with it.When playing a Coursera video that appeared, he showed that it automatically pinned the video to the top of the screen so the user could keep watching it even as they continued to have a back-and-forth dialog in text with ChatGPT in the typical input/output prompts and responses below. Users can then ask ChatGPT about content appearing in the video without specifying exactly what was said, as the Agents SDK pipes the information on the backend, server-side, from the connected app to the underlying ChatGPT AI model. So \"can you explain more about what they&#x27;re saying right now\" will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.In another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he&#x27;d had about his siblings&#x27; dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app, Canva, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT&#x27;s recommended business names, \"Walk This Wag,\" along with specific guidance about font choice (\"sans serif\") and overall coloration and style (\"bright and colorful.\")Instead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.After a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user&#x27;s ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.Christakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app, Zillow.He started a new chat session and asked a simple question: \"based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.\"Using ChatGPT&#x27;s optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in \"Zillow\" and \"show me some homes for sale there,\" which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.Clicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with \"most of the Zillow experience,\" entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.The user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as \"how close is it to a dog park?\" — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.It can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.Safety, privacy, and developer standardsOpenAI emphasized that apps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content standards to be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:serve a clear and valuable purposebe predictable and reliable in behaviorbe safe for general audiences, including teens aged 13–17respect user privacy and limit data collection to only what’s necessaryEvery app must also include a clear, published privacy policy, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from verified accounts, provide customer support contacts, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.OpenAI also published developer design guidelines, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain “conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,” according to the documentation.A new conversational app ecosystemBy opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged AI operating system — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.For developers, that means direct access to over 800 million ChatGPT users, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.For users, it means a new generation of apps you can chat with — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped GPT Store, which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back.",

Apps must:serve a clear and valuable purposebe predictable and reliable in behaviorbe safe for general audiences, including teens aged 13–17respect user privacy and limit data collection to only what’s necessaryEvery app must also include a clear, published privacy policy, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from verified accounts, provide customer support contacts, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.OpenAI also published developer design guidelines, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain “conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,” according to the documentation.A new conversational app ecosystemBy opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged AI operating system — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.For developers, that means direct access to over 800 million ChatGPT users, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.For users, it means a new generation of apps you can chat with — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped GPT Store, which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back.",

          "standfirst": "When I write about the cognitive migration now underway, brought about by the rapid advance of gen AI, I do so from the perspective of someone who has spent four decades in the technology industry. My own journey runs from coding business applications in Fortran and COBOL to systems analysis and design, IT project management, enterprise systems consulting, computing hardware sales and technology industry communications. All of it has been centered in the U.S., although I have collaborated with colleagues and clients across Europe and Asia.My writing carries an American, tech-industry vantage point, although I make attempts to see a broader perspective. Perhaps that is fitting, since much of the frontier development of AI remains clustered in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and a handful of other Western hubs. But how does this migration look beyond America’s borders? For millions in the Global South, cognitive migration is less about the loss of white-collar prestige and more about the chance to leapfrog into new opportunities.This divide is visible in the data. The 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer found that fewer than one in three Americans feel comfortable with businesses using AI, while in India, Indonesia and Nigeria nearly two-thirds express comfort. In the West, AI may be perceived to threaten job loss and displacement, and this view may be warranted. A study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that 60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to the impact of AI due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. The Wall Street Journal quoted Ford CEO Jim Farley: “AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind.”In the Global South, however, AI is often perceived as an opportunity to improve education, strengthen healthcare, modernize agriculture and drive development. One analysis argues that for the Global South, “AI holds tangible promise for nations historically excluded from the benefits of previous industrial revolutions.” Perhaps this explains the findings reported by Academia.edu that Global North newspapers publish more negative AI headlines, while Global South outlets emphasize opportunity. Yet the story is not so simple. Even where the potential for advancement is emphasized, there is often also worry about loss of work, ethics, algorithmic bias, access and technical capacity. As with earlier waves of globalization, gains and risks will be distributed unevenly.AI as opportunityThere is a strong positive narrative around AI in the Global South, with many hopeful stories and promising results. In Nigeria, a World Bank-funded after-school tutoring program that used AI to tailor lessons to individual students produced striking results with nearly two years of learning gains in just six weeks. For communities with few qualified teachers, such gains are not incremental improvements. They can transform futures. Healthcare applications provide comparable stories. In India, Boston Consulting Group reports that AI diagnostic tools are being deployed in rural clinics with few doctors, offering screenings for conditions such as breast cancer or tuberculosis that might otherwise go undetected. These tools extend the reach of limited health resources and help detect conditions before it is too late.The use of AI in agriculture also shows promise. In Kenya, the PlantVillage Nuru app developed with Penn State University uses AI to detect crop diseases through farmers’ smartphones, equipping them to spot and treat threats to their harvests early. For households that depend on subsistence farming, such tools can mean the difference between security and scarcity.Yet many of these breakthroughs rely on Northern institutions, creating benefits but also exposing a fragile dependency. When outside funding or partnerships end, local efforts can stall. In this sense, leapfrogging risks being built on borrowed foundations.Taken together, these examples illustrate why many in the Global South see AI as a chance to transform trajectories rather than repeat old patterns. Yet optimism tells only part of the story. Alongside these gains are deep structural challenges that complicate the journey, reminding us that this migration, like all others, carries benefits that include hidden costs.Barriers to progressResearch also shows that AI adoption across the Global South is hindered by persistent gaps in infrastructure, data, skills and governance. Availability of reliable electricity and broadband remains uneven, local datasets are often scarce or biased and many countries face shortages of trained professionals to develop and oversee AI systems. Without strong regulatory frameworks, societies are also more exposed to privacy risks, exploitative labor practices and algorithmic bias. These realities mean that while AI holds promise as a development pathway, it can also deepen inequality if its benefits concentrate in urban centers and among elites, while leaving rural communities behind.So why do surveys of trust show higher comfort with AI in the Global South than in the West? One explanation lies in expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, AI is often perceived as a threat to stable jobs and established professions. In Nigeria, India or Indonesia, by contrast, it is more likely to be framed as a tool for closing persistent gaps. Media narratives often reinforce the divergence in expectations. In the West, headlines emphasize automation anxiety, while in the Global South, AI is more often described as a development pathway. Add to this the fact that many people in the Global South report higher levels of trust in institutions overall, and the disparity begins to make sense. The same technology intersects with different baselines, diverse needs, distinct cultures and different stories, which shape whether AI is welcomed with suspicion or with hope. Yet beyond these perceptual differences lie material realities that complicate the optimistic narrative, particularly in how global AI development distributes both its benefits and its burdens.Hidden costsEvery migration carries costs alongside gains, and the story of AI in the Global South is no different. While the overall AI narrative in the Global South leans positive, many celebrated breakthroughs depend on large workforces doing essential yet hidden tasks. Data annotation and content review are indispensable to the global AI economy, but the work is repetitive, emotionally taxing and poorly paid relative to the value it creates.Other sectors face pressure from a different direction. In India and the Philippines, business process outsourcing and call centers employ millions of workers who support global clients. These roles depend on language, routine cognitive tasks and customer service, the very areas where AI chatbots and automated platforms are advancing fastest.The shift is not immediate, but workers in these industries are already questioning whether the migration now underway will carry them forward or leave them behind. Is cognitive migration a single global phenomenon, or are we witnessing multiple migrations that only appear connected?Many routes, shared destinationIs this the same cognitive migration unfolding everywhere, or are there separate journeys? On the surface, the story looks divided. In the U.S. and Europe, professionals worry about displacement from stable careers and a risk to their lifestyles. In India, Nigeria and Indonesia, AI is often presented as a chance to accelerate development and fill long-standing gaps. These appear to be distinct migrations.Yet, the reality is more entangled. The story of AI in the Global South is not simply one of catching up, just as the story in the West is not simply one of decline. Migration is never only progress or only loss. It is both, with something gained and something given up. For teachers in Nigeria, the gain may be students advancing at unprecedented speed. For call center workers in India, the loss may be jobs once thought secure. For farmers in Kenya, the gain may be healthier crops and steadier harvests. For professionals in Europe or the United States, the loss may be careers reshaped or diminished by automation.This variability in experience is not because AI technology is somehow different in one area or another, but because the lived experiences are diverse. The same systems can seem empowering in one place and threatening in another. An uneven passageWhat lies ahead is still uncertain. But if migration teaches anything, it is that adaptation requires not only resilience but imagination. The task is not to deny what is lost or to celebrate only what is gained, but to recognize both and design wisely for what comes next.This migration is not unfolding along a single path. It is fractured and revealing. The starting points differ, the routes are uneven, and the burdens are not equally shared. In the Global South, AI is often seen as a lever for progress, not a threat to status. But beneath the promise lie the same risks we face everywhere, including extraction without investment, automation without inclusion, innovation without safeguards and deployment without trust. These are not side effects. They are signals. If we ignore them, the cognitive future will be one more story written by the few for the few. As Indonesian policy advisor Tuhu Nugraha has argued in Modern Diplomacy: “As concerns rise globally about AI’s unchecked development potentially destabilizing economies or social cohesion, models from the Global South that emphasize inclusion, trust and reflection can help mitigate those risks before they explode into global backlash.” His warning reinforces the point that inclusion and trust must be part of the design of AI advancement and not assumed.If we pay attention, the Global South may offer not just caution but clarity. The choice is not only whether to design wisely, but whose experience we treat as essential when we do. Because in the end, cognitive migration is not regional. It is a worldwide passage, and how we navigate it together will shape not just the future of AI, but the future of being human.Gary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman.",

          "standfirst": "Presented by DXC TechnologyThe sheer volume and sophistication of incoming threats today has dwarfed attacks from just six months ago, let alone two years ago, because adversaries have leveled up with AI. Naturally, security operations and analysts are under pressure, facing mounting alert volumes and false positives, while organizations scramble to support them amidst a widening talent gap and an old model that doesn&#x27;t stand up, says Chris Drumgoole, president, global infrastructure services at DXC Technology.\"The traditional, linear SOC [Security Operations Center] method was built very much like the rest of information technology service management — ticket, investigate threat — but the math just doesn’t add up given the volume,\" Drumgoole says. \"You would need a SOC bigger than your customer call center just to deal with all the incoming tickets. And that pure volume question is coupled with the increasing sophistication of tools and attacks. When you put those things in a blender, you end up with an old model that doesn’t work anymore.\"To combat alert fatigue and slow investigation cycles, organizations are fighting fire with fire: agentic security, or intelligent AI agents, that are capable of independently triaging, investigating, and responding to incidents at scale. DXC has partnered with 7AI to launch DXC Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC) integrating fully autonomous AI agents into its end-to-end managed security operations. But before rolling this out globally to customers, DXC put the technology to the test, Drumgoole adds, using 7AI&#x27;s agentic platform to optimize its own internal SOC capabilities. They immediately saw an 80% reduction in tier-1 SOC analyst time and a 95% reduction in the number of tickets that humans must analyze, which means a 67% reduction in mean time to respond in the tier-1 and tier-2 SOC. A category shift, not an incremental update This isn&#x27;t just upgraded automation, but a major shift in threat response, analogous to the earlier shift from static defense to dynamic response. Agentic security isn&#x27;t rule-based — it&#x27;s adaptive, contextual, and end-to-end. And though humans will stay in the loop over the long term, agentic AI has the potential to move from reactive triage to proactive, self-directed defense.\"The real difference is that the AI model gives every alert the side eye, so to speak,\" Drumgoole says. \"While automation responds to the same alert the same way every time, the AI agent approaches each situation uniquely, recognizes the nuances and can learn from what it saw the last time and the time before. What we expect from our new Agentic SOC is going to be evolutionarily different just in terms of the amount they handle and how fast they handle it going forward.\"DXC Agentic SOC eliminates the traditional bottlenecks of manual alert processing, expecting to save customers 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per investigation by reducing false positive rates that can consume analyst resources. Average response time has gone from about 74 minutes to 24 minutes, a 70% improvement over the average human capability. \"The data speaks for itself. The math is the math,\" Drumgoole says. \"In the first 40 days of running our own Agentic SOC, we saved 165 human days of analyst work time. It’s only going up from there.An evolve-or-die momentEven though the math speaks for itself in terms of accuracy, many organizations are still nervous about AI in general, and in particular, relying on it to transform their processes. Most workflows are built around humans, and bringing AI into the mix means disrupting that workflow, which adds time and material costs, and even takes an emotional toll. \"That’s a big adjustment for people,\" Drumgoole says. \"It’s really not a technical barrier, but an emotional, operational, and process barrier, underlined by &#x27;this is the way we’ve always done it&#x27; thinking.\"But according to Drumgoole, it’s an evolve-or-die moment, and organizations need to push through the uncertainty. The mandate has to come from the top level, with executive-level sponsorship and clear mission. The beauty of the solution is that it&#x27;s straightforward to implement and easy to scale, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be considered a technology transformation, necessarily. Instead, it should be treated as equivalent to adding a stable of tier-1 security analysts. It doesn&#x27;t require data storage or access to personal information, just needs to have the same security and access controls that an analyst would.\"Those who embrace it will grow their business,\" he explains. \"The more you can invest in training your agents, in building and deploying them, the better they’re going to get.

          "content": "Google is previewing a new Gemini AI model designed to navigate and interact with the web via a browser, letting AI agents do things inside interfaces designed for use by people and not robots. The model, called Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, uses “visual understanding and reasoning capabilities” to analyze a user’s request and carry out a task, such as filling out and submitting a form. It can be used for UI testing or navigating interfaces made for people who don&#8217;t have an API or other direct connection available. Other versions of this model have been used for agentic features in AI Mode and Project Mariner, a research prototype that uses AI agents to carry out tasks on its own in a browser, like adding items to your cart based on a list of ingredients. Google’s announcement comes just one day after OpenAI revealed new apps for ChatGPT as part of its annual Dev Day, and continues to focus its attention on its ChatGPT Agent feature that can complete complex tasks on your behalf. Meanwhile, Anthropic had already released a version of its Claude AI model with “computer use” last year. Google posted some demo videos showing its computer use tool in action, and notes that they are sped up 3x. Google says its computer use model “outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile benchmarks.” Unlike ChatGPT Agent and Anthropic’s computer use tool, Google’s new AI model only has access to a browser — not an entire computer environment. Google notes that it shows “it is not yet optimized for desktop OS-level control” and currently supports 13 actions, including opening a web browser, typing text, as well as dragging and dropping elements. Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available to developers through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, but there’s also a demo on Browserbase, where you watch as it completes tasks, like “Play a game of 2048” or “Browse Hacker News for trending debates.”",

Tesla fans have long-awaited a cheaper entry-level model; this was supposed to be the $25,000 Model 2. But the development of that electric vehicle was shelved earlier last year as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making in favor of humanoid robots. However, car sales still make up the overwhelming majority of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter. The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km). In the past, Tesla has software-locked batteries to a smaller configuration; however, here we believe the Standard Range Model Y uses a 69 kWh pack.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When OpenAI launched the Sora 2 video generator last week, the company wrote that it was taking measures to \"block depictions of public figures\" by default. But creators and viewers of Sora 2 videos are finding that prohibition has a rather large loophole, allowing for videos of public figures that happen to be dead. Examples of celebrities being posthumously inserted into Sora 2 video creations are not hard to find all over social media these days. Tupac Shakur chatting with Malcolm X. Bruce Lee running a \"dragon energy\" DJ set. Michael Jackson doing kitchen-based standup comedy. Stephen Hawking's wheelchair wiping out on a giant skateboard ramp. Mister Rogers doing a cameo on Jackass. Kurt Cobain stealing KFC chicken fingers. Martin Luther King Jr. stuttering through a major speech. The list goes on and on. OpenAI places a moving Sora watermark over each generated video, which limits the risk of viewers being fooled by fake footage of real people. Still, seeing these deceased celebrities used as props by an AI tool can obviously be upsetting to their living relatives and fans.Read full article Comments",

That means the first elements of the antitrust remedies won by Epic Games will have to be implemented in mere weeks. The app store case is one of three ongoing antitrust actions against Google, but it's the furthest along of them. Google lost the case in 2023, and in 2024, US District Judge James Donato ordered a raft of sweeping changes aimed at breaking Google's illegal monopoly on Android app distribution. In July, Google lost its initial appeal, leaving it with little time before the mandated changes must begin. Its petition to the Supreme Court was Google's final Hail Mary to avoid opening the Play Store even a crack. Google asked the justices to pause remedies pending its appeal, but the court has declined to do so, Reuters reports. Hopefully, Google planned for this eventuality because it must implement the first phase of the remedies by October 22.Read full article Comments",

But some users on Reddit and elsewhere objected to Apple's wholesale removal of the old multitasking mode, Split View (which allowed two apps onscreen at a time with a handle for adjusting the amount of screen they took up) and Slide Over (which allowed a small window to be swiped over top of your screen and then quickly dismissed when you were done with it). Split View was reasonably easy to recreate with the new system, but users who had relied on Slide Over bemoaned the lack of an equivalent feature in iPadOS 26. Apple apparently agrees because the second developer beta of the upcoming iPadOS 26.1 adds Slide Over support back into the operating system (as reported by MacRumors). Like the old Slide Over window, the new one sits on top of all your other apps and can be invoked and dismissed whenever you want.Read full article Comments",

The SDK is built on the open source Model Context Protocol (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added. The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.Read full article Comments",

Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok. Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency was sued Wednesday over an allegedly politically motivated decision to end a program that Congress intended to help low-income and disadvantaged communities across the US save money on electricity bills through rooftop and community solar programs. In their complaint, a group of plaintiffs who would have benefited from the EPA's \"Solar for All\" program—including a labor union, several businesses, and a homeowner who cannot afford her electricity bills without it—accused the EPA of violating federal law and the Constitution by unlawfully terminating the program. Solar for All was \"expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households,\" plaintiffs noted. Additionally, it was \"expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "“Illusions are fun, but they are also a gateway to perception,” says Hyeyoung Shin, assistant professor of neuroscience at Seoul National University. Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University. What the brain “knows” Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the Kanizsa triangle: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.

          "content": "Few modern F1 venues are as dazzling as the Marina Bay circuit in Singapore. If you watch the early practice or the young women of F1 Academy in their races, you'll get an idea of the street circuit's relationship to the city in daylight as it takes in landmarks and crosses the water. At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1. Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K. As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that electromagnetic interference from an underground train line caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams remained worried about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. For the record, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.Read full article Comments",
