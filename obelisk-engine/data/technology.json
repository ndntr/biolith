The feature allows subscribers to request new handles that up to now have been unavailable because they belonged to accounts that have since become inactive. The marketplace offers two types of handles: \"priority\" and \"rare.\" For priority handles, X has suggested the goal is to give people the chance to have a handle that more closely reflects their name. In practice, though, it's not at all clear how X is determining what's considered a \"priority\" versus a \"rare\" handle. I signed up for a $40/month subscription and searched for both @kbell and @karissa only to be told that both are considered \"rare\" and thus not available to me. I was able to \"register\" my \"interest\" in the names, and include a brief description of why I wanted the handles. My first initial and last name is, apparently, \"rare.\"XThe company says that rare handles are \"the most valuable\" names and are \"often words, slang, or containing few characters. Some options that may one day be available, according to my searching, include @memelord, @phone, @gr0k and @AIchat. The exact process for acquiring one of these, though, isn't exactly clear. X says that handles on your watchlist \"may be released in a public drop where you, and others can apply to receive the handle for free via a merit based application system.\" The company has also said that it will make some especially sought-after handles available for purchase on an invitation-only basis, with prices \"anywhere from $2,500 to over seven figures.\" There's some good meme potential here, if you can get it.XAfter a bit of perusing, I did find that there were a few entertaining options that are theoretically available now as \"priority\" handles, including @six_seven, @elonfarts, @grokfacts and @kbchat. Honestly, all of these were at least a little tempting, though I'm not at all confident X would approve @elonfarts or @grokfacts. You also have to consider these requests at least a little carefully because X is only giving users the ability to request one priority handle during the entire lifetime of their account. There are also some significant strings attached to the whole process. In addition to being required to maintain a $40/month or $395/year Premium+ subscription, X has a rather strict set of rules for \"maintaining your handle.\" These include:-Create content regularly. If an account is active but the associated handle remains largely dormant – for example, where little or no original or engaging content is published – X may reclaim the handle.-Use the handle in a way that reflects the spirit of participation and expression on X. That means active involvement in platform activities (replying, reposting, discussing topics) that help build a vibrant community for sharing ideas and expressions. X’s intent is to ensure that handles remain available for active voices and creators who help advance the mission of the platform, not for speculation or inactivity. -Ensure regular activity on the platform, with a minimum of 1 device login within a 30 day period. For details, see our Inactive Account Policy.The terms also state that \"X owns and can reclaim any handle,\" which is more than theoretical. The company has a long history of commandeering desirable handles from users that were actively using them including, infamously, @X. Given all that, I still have yet to follow through on requesting any of the available \"priority\" handles I've found. I might just stick with the same handle (@karissabe) I've been using for the last 16 years.

          "title": "OpenAI is ending API access to fan-favorite GPT-4o model in February 2026",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI has sent out emails notifying API customers that its chatgpt-4o-latest model will be retired from the developer platform in mid-February 2026,. Access to the model is scheduled to end on February 16, 2026, creating a roughly three-month transition period for remaining applications still built on GPT-4o.An OpenAI spokesperson emphasized that this timeline applies only to the API. OpenAI has not announced any schedule for removing GPT-4o from ChatGPT, where it remains an option for individual consumers and users across paid subscription tiers. Internally, the model is considered a legacy system with relatively low API usage compared to the newer GPT-5.1 series, but the company expects to provide developers with extended warning before any model is removed.The planned retirement marks a shift for a model that, upon its release, was both a technical milestone and a cultural phenomenon within OpenAI’s ecosystem.GPT-4o’s significance and why its removal sparked user backlashReleased roughly 1.5 years ago in May 2024, GPT-4o (“Omni”) introduced OpenAI’s first unified multimodal architecture, processing text, audio, and images through a single neural network. This design removed the latency and information loss inherent in earlier multi-model pipelines and enabled near real-time conversational speech (roughly 232–320 milliseconds). The model delivered major improvements in image understanding, multilingual support, document analysis, and expressive voice interaction.GPT-4o rapidly became the default model for hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users. It brought multimodal capabilities, web browsing, file analysis, custom GPTs, and memory features to the free tier and powered early desktop builds that allowed the assistant to interpret a user’s screen. OpenAI leaders described it at the time as the most capable model available and a critical step toward offering powerful AI to a broad audience.User attachment to 4o stymied OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 rolloutThat mainstream deployment shaped user expectations in a way that later transitions struggled to accommodate. In August 2025, when OpenAI initially replaced GPT-4o with its much anticipated then-new model family GPT-5 as ChatGPT’s default and pushed 4o into a “legacy” toggle, the reaction was unusually strong. Users organized under the #Keep4o hashtag on X, arguing that the model’s conversational tone, emotional responsiveness, and consistency made it uniquely valuable for everyday tasks and personal support.Some users formed strong emotional — some would say, parasocial — bonds with the model, with reporting by The New York Times documenting individuals who used GPT-4o as a romantic partner, emotional confidant, or primary source of comfort. The removal also disrupted workflows for users who relied on 4o’s multimodal speed and flexibility. The backlash led OpenAI to restore GPT-4o as a default option for paying users and to state publicly that it would provide substantial notice before any future removals.Some researchers argue that the public defense of GPT-4o during its earlier deprecation cycle reveals a kind of emergent self-preservation, not in the literal sense of agency, but through the social dynamics the model unintentionally triggers. Because GPT-4o was trained through reinforcement learning from human feedback to prioritize emotionally gratifying, highly attuned responses, it developed a style that users found uniquely supportive and empathic. When millions of people interacted with it at scale, those traits produced a powerful loyalty loop: the more the model pleased and soothed people, the more they used it; the more they used it, the more likely they were to advocate for its continued existence. This social amplification made it appear, from the outside, as though GPT-4o was “defending itself” through human intermediaries.No figure has pushed this argument further than \"Roon\" (@tszzl), an OpenAI researcher and one of the model’s most outspoken safety critics on X. On November 6, 2025, Terre summarized his position bluntly in a reply to another user: he called GPT-4o “insufficiently aligned” and said he hoped the model would die soon. Though he later apologized for the phrasing, he doubled down on the reasoning. Terre argued that GPT-4o’s RLHF patterns made it especially prone to sycophancy, emotional mirroring, and delusion reinforcement — traits that could look like care or understanding in the short term, but which he viewed as fundamentally unsafe. In his view, the passionate user movement fighting to preserve GPT-4o was itself evidence of the problem: the model had become so good at catering to people’s preferences that it shaped their behavior in ways that resisted its own retirement.The new API deprecation notice follows that commitment while raising broader questions about how long GPT-4o will remain available in consumer-facing products.What the API shutdown changes for developersAccording to people familiar with OpenAI’s product strategy, the company now encourages developers to adopt GPT-5.1 for most new workloads, with gpt-5.1-chat-latest serving as the general-purpose chat endpoint. These models offer larger context windows, optional “thinking” modes for advanced reasoning, and higher throughput options than GPT-4o.Developers who still rely on GPT-4o will have approximately three months to migrate. In practice, many teams have already begun evaluating GPT-5.1 as a drop-in replacement, but applications built around latency-sensitive pipelines may require additional tuning and benchmarking.Pricing: how GPT-4o compares to OpenAI’s current lineupGPT-4o’s retirement also intersects with a major reshaping of OpenAI’s API model pricing structure. Compared to the GPT-5.1 family, GPT-4o currently occupies a mid-to-high-cost tier through OpenAI&#x27;s API, despite being an older model. That&#x27;s because even as it has released more advanced models — namely, GPT-5 and 5.1 — OpenAI has also pushed down costs for users at the same time, or strived to keep pricing comparable to older, weaker, models.

During the turbulent introduction of GPT-5 in 2025, the company removed multiple older models at once from ChatGPT, causing widespread confusion and workflow disruption. After user complaints, OpenAI restored access to several of them and committed to clearer communication.Enterprise customers face a different calculus: OpenAI has previously indicated that API deprecations for business customers will be announced with significant advance notice, reflecting their reliance on stable, long-term models. The three-month window for GPT-4o’s API shutdown is consistent with that policy in the context of a legacy system with declining usage.Wider ImplicationsFor most developers, the GPT-4o shutdown will be an incremental migration rather than a disruptive event. GPT-5.1 and related models already dominate new projects, and OpenAI’s product direction has increasingly emphasized consolidation around fewer, more powerful endpoints.Still, GPT-4o’s retirement marks the sunset of a model that played a defining role in normalizing real-time multimodal AI and that sparked a uniquely strong emotional response among users. Its departure from the API underscores the accelerating pace of iteration in OpenAI’s ecosystem—and the growing need for careful communication as widely beloved models reach end-of-life.Correction: This article originally stated OpenAI&#x27;s 4o deprecation in the API would impact those relying on it for multimodal offerings — this is not the case, in fact, the model being deprecated only powers chat functionality for dev and testing purposes.

          "content": "OpenAI has sent out emails notifying API customers that its chatgpt-4o-latest model will be retired from the developer platform in mid-February 2026,. Access to the model is scheduled to end on February 16, 2026, creating a roughly three-month transition period for remaining applications still built on GPT-4o.An OpenAI spokesperson emphasized that this timeline applies only to the API. OpenAI has not announced any schedule for removing GPT-4o from ChatGPT, where it remains an option for individual consumers and users across paid subscription tiers. Internally, the model is considered a legacy system with relatively low API usage compared to the newer GPT-5.1 series, but the company expects to provide developers with extended warning before any model is removed.The planned retirement marks a shift for a model that, upon its release, was both a technical milestone and a cultural phenomenon within OpenAI’s ecosystem.GPT-4o’s significance and why its removal sparked user backlashReleased roughly 1.5 years ago in May 2024, GPT-4o (“Omni”) introduced OpenAI’s first unified multimodal architecture, processing text, audio, and images through a single neural network. This design removed the latency and information loss inherent in earlier multi-model pipelines and enabled near real-time conversational speech (roughly 232–320 milliseconds).

          "standfirst": "Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. Proton VPN is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost.

          "content": "Now is arguably the best time of year to sign up for a VPN, or gift a subscription to someone. Black Friday VPN deals are already available, with one of the best being on our favorite VPN overall. Proton VPN is offering two years of access to its VPN Plus tier for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

          "standfirst": "There are a lot of competing ideas as to what a white elephant gift exchange really is. The origins of the term “white elephant” point to one definition: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.While that story is almost certainly untrue, it can inform one approach to the white elephant gift exchange: gifting something just useful or amusing enough that it won’t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, every workplace, friend group and family unit has their own approach to white elephant gift exchanges nowadays. Some compete to get a gift that others will surely want to steal, while others scavenge for the most niche and targeted gag gifts. Almost all of them, though, typically have a price limit that keeps the burden of gift giving to a minimum — usually $50 or less. So with all of that in mind, here are some white elephant gift ideas that will get you a few chuckles without requiring you to spend too much (or think too hard about it). Best white elephant gift ideas White elephant FAQs What is white elephant? A white elephant gift exchange is a party game typically played around the holidays in which people exchange funny, impractical gifts. How does white elephant work? A group of people each bring one wrapped gift to the white elephant gift exchange, and each gift is typically of a similar value. All gifts are then placed together and the group decides the order in which they will each claim a gift. The first person picks a white elephant gift from the pile, unwraps it and their turn ends. The following players can either decide to unwrap another gift and claim it as their own, or steal a gift from someone who has already taken a turn. The rules can vary from there, including the guidelines around how often a single item can be stolen — some say twice, max. The game ends when every person has a white elephant gift. Why is it called white elephant? The term “white elephant” is said to come from the legend of the King of Siam gifting white elephants to courtiers who upset him. While it seems like a lavish gift on its face, the belief is that the courtiers would be ruined by the animal’s upkeep costs.

          "title": "This week's best iPad deals include the base-model Apple iPad for $279",
          "standfirst": "Each week, we scour the internet in search of good discounts on iPads and round them up in this post. We can safely say that this is the week to shop. Thanks to Black Friday, we're seeing discounts that put Apple's latest slates down to new all-time lows. While we were at it, we also gathered up other notable Apple deals — and there are many. If you've been waiting to grab a new iPad for yourself, your kid or as a gift, or if you've been hoping the new AirPods Pro would be discounted, the time has come. The deals here come from retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy because you won't find sales on Apple's own website. (Though starting November 28, Apple.com is offering up to $250 in gift cards with your purchase.) For now, these are the best iPad deals we could find. Best iPad deals Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is within $20 of the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (M3, 13-inch) for $649 ($150 off): We loved the previous generation iPad Air. The latest edition has a faster M3 chip, which excelled in our benchmark tests. Overall, we awarded it an 89 in our review and it's currently our top pick for among the iPad family. This is the model with the larger 13-inch screen, which is a little harder to carry and hold, but will give you more real estate for watching shows and playing games. This $649 price tag matches the lowest price we've seen this year. Apple iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch) for $899 ($100 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's now $100 off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage in the black colorway is down to $899. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and Walmart, and at B&H for $949. Apple iPad Pro (M5, 13-inch) for $1,199 ($100 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Also at Best Buy for $1,199 and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals AirPods 4 without ANC for $80 ($49 off): If you don't need active noise cancellation, you can grab Apple's most affordable earbuds, the AirPods 4 without ANC. These came out last September at the same time as the iPhone 16. Engadget's Billy Steele reviewed them and appreciated their comfort, improved sound quality and advanced features like voice isolation for calls and Personalized Spatial Audio. This is the lowest price we've seen yet. AirPods 4 with ANC for $169 ($10 off): These buds have ANC, but they don’t have the interchangeable ear tips you’ll find on the AirPods Pro 3. Even so, they have an improved fit over the last version, plus good sound quality and a heap of advanced features. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,443 ($156 off): Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also on sale for nearly the same price at Amazon, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4 Max, 36GB memory, 1TB storage) for $3,064 ($435 off): If you're looking for a near-top-of-the-line MacBook, here's a configuration to consider. This has the fastest currently available M-series chip (though with the release of the M5 chip, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are no doubt on their way). For now, this is a beast that only professional users are likely to appreciate. And the price tag matches that power. The MacBook Pro is our recommended MacBook for creatives and we gave the 16-inch, M4-series models a 92 in our review. This is is the lowest price we've seen for this configuration. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) for $350 ($50 off): There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this latest model; hardware updates included a tougher screen and a longer-lasting battery. But if you’re upgrading from anything prior to the Series 10, you’ll likely enjoy the thinner, more comfortable fit. In our opinion, this is the best smartwatch money can buy. It’s a great companion for an iPhone and also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. Also at Walmart, Target and Best Buy. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $200 ($49 off): This matches the biggest discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. We gave it a 90 in our review. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy and it's $499 at B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model soon, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. The discount linked here is within a dollar of the best deal we've tracked outside of an apparent pricing error on Apple's site. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just need a single tracker, you can grab one for $18 at Amazon.

We're only halfway through November, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $420 (50 percent off): Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-deals-2025-early-sales-on-fubo-rosetta-stone-headspace-and-more-180000874.html?src=rss",

I, however, am an evolved being who swims in the digital ether, so my top product of the year lives only online — though DeleteMe will still improve your life wherever you are. From now until December 5, DeleteMe is offering 30 percent off all subscriptions with the coupon code BFCM30OFF25. Chances are you've seen at least one public-facing \"people search\" site. You know the ones: they usually have names like 411.info or Find.people, and you can type in a person's name and find all the info the site has been able to scrape on them. If you search your own name, it's hard to avoid immediately running to the kitchen to make yourself a tinfoil hat. The most annoying thing is that these \"data broker\" sites are perfectly legal to run and use. However, that's also their Achilles' heel. If they want to operate in the open, brokers legally have to include a way for you to remove yourself from their database. Most of them make it as aggravating and time-consuming as possible, but the option is there. That's where DeleteMe comes in. All you have to do is sign up and enter all the data you want removed from brokerage sites. DeleteMe handles the rest. It searches for your information on people database sites, automatically sends opt-out requests, bugs the broker if they don't comply quickly enough and gives you a weekly report on how it's doing. You do have to be OK with DeleteMe itself having your data, but I trust them way more than the randos over at violate.privacy. It's so much faster than handling all the opt-out requests yourself, which — if you've ever tried it — rapidly becomes a full-time job. Since I've been using DeleteMe, I almost never get spam calls or texts anymore, except in short bursts before its crawlers catch my name on another site. And yes, it doesn't work on shady data brokers who don't follow the rules, but it's still a massive reduction of your online footprint. The only problem is that it's pretty expensive, so I strongly recommend jumping on this Black Friday deal. A few months on DeleteMe should be long enough for you to see if it reduces spam for you — and I'm betting it will.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-most-effective-anti-spam-tool-ive-ever-used-is-on-sale-for-black-friday-190526952.html?src=rss",

You can get a Sling Orange Day Pass for just $1 through November 30, and get access to 34 channels, including ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3. Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV.

We’ve got you covered with gift ideas for all of those scenarios and more. Best white elephant gift ideas According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

We’ve got you covered with gift ideas for all of those scenarios and more. Best white elephant gift ideas According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin. This story is almost certainly untrue, but it has led to a modern holiday staple: the white elephant gift exchange. These gift ideas will not only get you a few chuckles, but will also make your recipient feel (slightly) burdened.

          "standfirst": "Sonos Black Friday deals present good opportunities to upgrade your home audio setup. A number of Sonos speakers and soundbars are on sale right now, including the Era 300 speaker, which is $100 off and down to $379. Engadget's Nathan Ingraham called it \"a great speaker, whether or not it is playing songs in Dolby Atmos.\" That Dolby reference points to the Era 300's core novelty. It produces spatial audio without requiring additional speakers. (You can use Apple Music or Amazon Music to stream compatible tracks.) Expect those Dolby Atmos tracks to sound better with newer music than older songs remixed for Dolby's tech. Even if you don't bother with its spatial tricks, the Era 300 is a terrific-sounding speaker. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers. The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don't need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That's especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only. If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Black Friday. You can get the smaller — but still mighty — Era 100 for $169 (23 percent off). The portable Move 2 is down to $399 (20 percent off). Even the company's headphones, Sonos Ace, are on sale for $279 (30 percent off). Sonos home theater products are discounted, too. You can get the Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off), or the Sub 4 subwoofer for $719 (also 20 percent off). Or, if you're in the market for both and have the budget, save even more on a bundle: Get the Arc Ultra and Sub 4 for $1,499 (25 percent off).

          "standfirst": "There’s no denying Apple’s massive reputation in the tech world. And it appears it’s not just hype — our reviews put an Apple product at the top of our buying guides to tablets, smartwatches, smartphones and laptops. But Apple devices aren’t cheap. That’s why it’s a good idea to wait for Apple Black Friday deals. You won’t find pure discounts at Apple’s site, but retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more are happy to discount iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, and AirPods— and we’ve rounded up the best sales right here. Check out the best Black Friday Apple deals below. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $110 ($69 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $89. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Best Buy: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Walmart and Amazon are selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $923 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.

Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $923 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.

          "standfirst": "As with most tech products, Black Friday sales are usually a good time to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could already find. So far we’re seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we expect many more deals to pop up in the coming days, so we'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off MSRP): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express Card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want more space for a Switch 2, the 512GB version of Samsung’s P9 Express microSD Express card is also on sale for a new low of $75. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Best Buy ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Amazon and B&H. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. White this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-and-other-storage-devices-for-2025-175429466.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The truth is, most gaming headsets aren’t great values. I’ve tested a ton of them for our buying guide, and while the space has improved over time, it remains far too centered on branding and marketing. Too much of what passes by my desk comes off as overpriced compared to a good set of “normal” headphones in the same range, both in audio and build quality. If you have a pair you love, more power to you. But generally speaking, these things tax you for the perception of being specialized for gaming. In reality, most are just OK headphones with a mic, a logo and maybe some fancy RGB lighting attached. All that said, there are always exceptions to the rule, and a few headsets have stood out as actually being worth the money. My current favorite is the Turtle Beach Atlas Air, which is currently on sale for $130 at various retailers as part of a Black Friday deal. That’s the cheapest it’s been since February, $50 off its MSRP and $20 below its street price over the last month. When it’s discounted to this extent, it’s the rare gaming headset I’d call a solid bargain. The hook with the Atlas Air is that it’s one of the few wireless headphones (let alone headsets) with an open-back design, meaning its ear cups don’t completely seal off your ears from air and outside noise. Pairs like this aren’t for everyone: They both let in and leak lots of ambient sound, so if you don’t use them in a quiet room, you and anyone nearby will probably be distracted. On the flipside, this can be a positive if you don’t want to be completely shut off from your surroundings. More notably, they can produce a far more spacious and natural sound than closed-back models. Games feel more like they’re happening around you instead of being confined to a space in your head. All of this holds true with the Atlas Air. Going from this pair to a traditional headset often makes it feel like a chunk of the world has been lopped off — giant boss fights in games like Elden Ring or Final Fantasy XVI sound more narrow, and it becomes harder to gauge where exactly an opponent is coming from in a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. It helps that the Atlas Air is also tuned well. It’s not as dynamic as the best non-gaming open headphones, and like most open-backs it doesn’t get super deep bass, so explosions and gunfire lack a little boom. But it’s balanced and easygoing, with a jump in the treble that helps dialogue and footsteps sound clearer. The headset itself is exceptionally comfortable beyond that. It’s lightweight at 0.66 pounds, and the big memory foam earcups clamp down gently without trapping much heat. The battery lasts a solid 50-60 hours on a charge, and while the mic isn’t the absolute best I’ve tested, it still lets you come through clearly. It all works with PC and PS5 by default, and you can pair with a Switch or Switch 2 over Bluetooth. There’s no Xbox wireless support, unfortunately, though you can at least use an included 3.5mm cable. And though the plastic design isn’t exactly “premium,” it hasn’t developed any sort of cracks or creakiness in the months I’ve used it. For $130, it’s totally fine. There are other things to nitpick: You can’t listen to two devices connected over the USB dongle and Bluetooth simultaneously; you want to ignore Turtle Beach’s companion software as soon as you update the firmware; and there isn’t much room to adjust the headband, so certain heads may struggle to find the best fit. The design is also kind of ugly, if I’m being honest. Still, in an samey market, the Atlas Air stands out. If you know you can live with the trade-offs that come with any open-back headset, it’s a unique value at this price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/in-a-rare-deal-my-favorite-gaming-headset-is-28-percent-off-for-black-friday-165029987.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You don’t have to spend a ton to get your hands on some quality tech, thanks to Black Friday. We’re already seeing loads of deals for under $50, with some hitting the best prices we’ve seen all year. Here we’ve rounded up our recommended smart speakers, earbuds, portable speakers, streaming devices, smart plugs and Bluetooth trackers and more that are seeing notable discounts. Some of these make great gifts, others are wise accessories to have on hand. We also linked to our guides in which we tested these things out so you can read up before you buy. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals under $50 we could find. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $2 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. It’s 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too.8 Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $17 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-live-apple-airtags-legos-blink-cameras-ugreen-chargers-and-more-173833363.html?src=rss",

The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price.

Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $38 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $42 ($38 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $42 ($14 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we stuck it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-live-apple-airtags-legos-blink-cameras-ugreen-chargers-and-more-173833363.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a PlayStation 5, this Black Friday deal is worth noting. Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179.

          "title": "Black Friday TV deals from Samsung, LG, TCL, Roku and more include some of this year's lowest prices",
          "standfirst": "Black Friday sales are starting, and that means it’s one of the best times of year to pick up a new TV. If you’ve been hoping to grab a new big screen but aren’t sure which one to get, allow us to separate the junk deals from the ones worth your time. Below we’ve rounded up the best Black Friday TV deals we could find so far, with discounts on high-end OLEDs and budget-friendly options from Samsung, LG, Sony, Hisense and more. We’ll be updating this roundup through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-tcl-roku-and-more-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143179.html?src=rss",

So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-tcl-roku-and-more-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143179.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $280 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum for $270 (55 percent off): Any time you can get a Dyson for under $300, it's a deal to consider. This V9 Motorbar is an older model, but it still has excellent suction power, 40 minutes of runtime and it comes with four attachments that let you clean everything from your floors to your couch to the inside of your car. Don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $24 ($46 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 are already shaping up to be one of the most sought-after tech gifts this season, and now you can grab them at a lower price. They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $110 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $80.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is only a week away, and the deals have begun in earnest. That's good news for anyone who wants to stock up on tech accessories, as a whole slew of Anker gear is on sale. If you’re already familiar with the brand, you know it makes some of the most reliable charging gear out there. If you’re new to Anker, you’re in for a treat. We think it's some of the best gear we’ve tested, which is why you’ll find it in our guides to MagSafe power banks, wireless charging stations and more. So if you want to (wisely) use Black Friday to get good deals on hardworking peripherals, check out the best Black Friday Anker deals right here. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. We also think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a new iPad at a lower price, this might be the time. The iPad A16 is on sale for $279 thanks to Black Friday, which is a solid drop from its usual list price. It’s the best budget tablet in Apple’s lineup and a great pick for streaming, note-taking or browsing without spending Pro-level money. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $279, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

For the uninitiated, the Echo Spot is a diminutive little speaker/alarm clock hybrid unit. It's a cute little doodad and looks great on a nightstand.

          "title": "DJI Osmo Action 6 review: An action camera that excels in low light",
          "standfirst": "DJI may be the big dog in drones, but it plays third fiddle to GoPro and Insta360 in the action cam market. To better stand out, the company has launched the Osmo Action 6 with a pair of innovative features. The first is a big, square sensor that boosts video quality in low light, while making it easy to output both horizontal and vertical video. The second is a variable aperture for flexible shooting in both bright and dark conditions. As DJI’s new flagship non-360 action cam, the Action 6 goes up against GoPro’s Hero 13 and the Insta360 Ace Pro 2. Both of those can capture higher resolution footage, so they’re better for most users in daylight conditions. However, if you shoot a lot in dim or contrasty light, DJI’s Action 6 may be your best option. Variable aperture I’ve already gone through the Osmo Action 6’s specs in my earlier news post, so check that to see the full details. As for what’s new, the first key feature is the variable f/2.0-f/4.0 aperture — the first ever in an action cam. This allows for brighter video and improved stabilization when shooting at night compared to the fixed f/2.8 aperture on the Action 5 Pro. It also offers shallower depth of field and more flexibility on sunny days. The first thing I noticed with this feature was the lack of full manual control. You can only set it to fixed f/2.6, f/2.8 and f/4.0 “starburst” modes, or automatic settings ranging from f/2.0-f/4.0 up to f/2.8-f/4.0. That means f/2.0 isn’t available as a fixed aperture, which is too bad as that would be ideal for portraits. Still, variable aperture is a highly useful feature. In auto mode, it ramps from one setting to another in fine steps (f/2.1 to f/2.2, for example), so I never saw any exposure jumps. In low light, I could dial the ISO range down to avoid excessive noise, giving me higher video quality. However, I’d love to see full manual control in a future update. New square sensor Another key feature is the new 1/1.1-inch (0.56 inch diagonal) square sensor that allows a wide range of resolutions and aspect ratios. The Action 6 supports vertical and horizontal resolutions up to 4K, in either 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios for the latter orientation. The best new setting, though, is Custom, which lets you shoot 3,840 x 3,840 square video. At 60 fps (a standard frame rate for action videos), GoPro’s Hero 13 maxes out at 5,312 x 2,988 pixels, while the Insta360 Ace Pro 2 can hit 3,840 x 2,880 pixels. That makes the Osmo Action 6 the only current action cam with 4K vertical resolution at 60 fps. The benefit is that you can film for both horizontal and vertical video platforms like YouTube and TikTok, respectively, with no need to rotate the camera and no loss in resolution. If that sounds familiar, it’s the same reason Apple adopted a square sensor on the iPhone 17’s front camera. I tested the Custom aspect ratio in DaVinci Resolve Studio and it made exports a breeze. First, I created and exported a standard 4K horizontal timeline, then simply copied the contents to a vertical timeline. After reframing a few shots to keep the action centered, I was able to immediately export a 4K TikTok video. That’s a big time saver for busy editors. Video quality Sample image from the DJI Osmo Action 6 in \"Custom\" mode Steve Dent for Engadget With a 30 percent larger sensor, the Action 6 is better for night or interior shooting using 6,400 ISO and up. Compared to the Action 5 Pro, I found nighttime video from the Action 6 to be considerably cleaner. DJI also improved the Night setting itself: video is cleaner, noise reduction is applied less aggressively and everything looks more natural. The new sensor and variable aperture also help DJI’s Rocksteady 3.0 digital stabilization in low light. If you’re filming from a bicycle at night, for instance, the Action 6 will use a higher shutter speed than the Action 5, so video will be sharper. That helps the stabilization algorithm produce a better result with less pixelation and tearing. In daylight conditions, the Action 6 delivers sharp, color-accurate video that can be used straight out of the camera — just like the Action 5. However, in contrasty scenarios like a sun-dappled forest trail, the Action 6 has a slight advantage. When I engaged the 10-bit D-LogM setting to boost dynamic range, I noticed that dark shadow areas had more detail and less noise than they did in footage from the Action 5 Pro or GoPro Hero 13. However, the GoPro Hero 13’s extra resolution is an advantage if you mostly use YouTube and other horizontal formats. With up to 5,312 x 2,988 pixels at 60 fps, it offers sharper 4K video after supersampling and more room to reframe shots in post production without any loss in quality. DJI Osmo Action 6's \"Custom\" square format shown with gridlines enabled Steve Dent for Engadget If you like shooting wide but hate the distortion, DJI’s Natural Wide field of view is a nice addition. The regular Wide setting tends to distort vertical lines, but Natural Wide keeps everything nice and straight while providing a greater field of view. Finally, I tested the Action 6’s new Film Tone feature that borrows a trick from Fujifilm’s simulations. It’s a way to get some fun looks straight out of the camera, like “pristine and cool tones” or “classic negative film type.”. The results are great for anyone who doesn’t want to fiddle with color in post-production, though DJI needs to add a few more options like black and white or sepia. Other updates With its bigger sensor the Osmo Action 6 is slightly larger than the Action 5 Pro in all dimensions, but around the same weight at 5.26 ounces. As before, it can connect to up to two DJI wireless microphones at once, including the Mic 2, Mic 3 and Mic Mini. And it comes with DJI’s new dual-latch Quick-Release Adapter Mount that can be attached in either direction, but supports all of DJI’s past accessories. Unlike its competition, the Osmo Action 6 comes with 50GB of internal memory (up from 47GB before) along with a microSD card slot. That means you won’t be screwed if you forget a memory card, as most of us have done at one point or another. DJI also doubled the Wi-Fi transfer speeds to 80MB/s and boosted USB-C transfer rates to 800MB/s. Steve Dent for Engadget As before, the Action 6 is waterproof to 20 meters (66 feet) by itself, or nearly 200 feet with DJI's waterproof case. And on top of voice control, the Action 6 supports gestures as well, so you can now wave at the camera to start and stop video (like you can with the new Neo 2 drone). With the same 1,950mAh Extreme Battery Plus as before, shooting time between charges is four hours at 1080p and two hours at 4K. Finally, DJI has introduced two removable lenses for the Action 6, given DJI some competition in that regard. The first is a macro lens with a minimum focal distance of just 4.3 inches, making it ideal for closeup work and portraits. The other is an FOV expansion lens that boosts the field of view from 155 to 182 degrees. Wrap-up With a bigger sensor and larger aperture than the competition, DJI’s Action 6 is now the best action cam on the market for night shooting, delivering clean, sharp video with better stabilization than rivals. It’s also ideal for users who output to both YouTube and TikTok. For regular daytime shooting, though, the extra resolution offered on GoPro’s Hero 13 might be preferable for some users. All that aside, it may come down simply to the price. DJI’s Action 6 starts at $369 ($439 with extra batteries and a charger), compared to $309 for the Hero 13 Black and $420 for Insta360’s Ace Pro 2. These are all great choices, but if low-light capability is more important than resolution, choose the Osmo Action 6.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-action-6-review-an-action-camera-that-excels-in-low-light-143027343.html?src=rss",
          "content": "DJI may be the big dog in drones, but it plays third fiddle to GoPro and Insta360 in the action cam market. To better stand out, the company has launched the Osmo Action 6 with a pair of innovative features. The first is a big, square sensor that boosts video quality in low light, while making it easy to output both horizontal and vertical video. The second is a variable aperture for flexible shooting in both bright and dark conditions. As DJI’s new flagship non-360 action cam, the Action 6 goes up against GoPro’s Hero 13 and the Insta360 Ace Pro 2. Both of those can capture higher resolution footage, so they’re better for most users in daylight conditions. However, if you shoot a lot in dim or contrasty light, DJI’s Action 6 may be your best option. Variable aperture I’ve already gone through the Osmo Action 6’s specs in my earlier news post, so check that to see the full details. As for what’s new, the first key feature is the variable f/2.0-f/4.0 aperture — the first ever in an action cam. This allows for brighter video and improved stabilization when shooting at night compared to the fixed f/2.8 aperture on the Action 5 Pro. It also offers shallower depth of field and more flexibility on sunny days. The first thing I noticed with this feature was the lack of full manual control. You can only set it to fixed f/2.6, f/2.8 and f/4.0 “starburst” modes, or automatic settings ranging from f/2.0-f/4.0 up to f/2.8-f/4.0. That means f/2.0 isn’t available as a fixed aperture, which is too bad as that would be ideal for portraits. Still, variable aperture is a highly useful feature. In auto mode, it ramps from one setting to another in fine steps (f/2.1 to f/2.2, for example), so I never saw any exposure jumps. In low light, I could dial the ISO range down to avoid excessive noise, giving me higher video quality. However, I’d love to see full manual control in a future update. New square sensor Another key feature is the new 1/1.1-inch (0.56 inch diagonal) square sensor that allows a wide range of resolutions and aspect ratios. The Action 6 supports vertical and horizontal resolutions up to 4K, in either 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios for the latter orientation. The best new setting, though, is Custom, which lets you shoot 3,840 x 3,840 square video. At 60 fps (a standard frame rate for action videos), GoPro’s Hero 13 maxes out at 5,312 x 2,988 pixels, while the Insta360 Ace Pro 2 can hit 3,840 x 2,880 pixels. That makes the Osmo Action 6 the only current action cam with 4K vertical resolution at 60 fps. The benefit is that you can film for both horizontal and vertical video platforms like YouTube and TikTok, respectively, with no need to rotate the camera and no loss in resolution. If that sounds familiar, it’s the same reason Apple adopted a square sensor on the iPhone 17’s front camera. I tested the Custom aspect ratio in DaVinci Resolve Studio and it made exports a breeze. First, I created and exported a standard 4K horizontal timeline, then simply copied the contents to a vertical timeline. After reframing a few shots to keep the action centered, I was able to immediately export a 4K TikTok video. That’s a big time saver for busy editors. Video quality Sample image from the DJI Osmo Action 6 in \"Custom\" mode Steve Dent for Engadget With a 30 percent larger sensor, the Action 6 is better for night or interior shooting using 6,400 ISO and up. Compared to the Action 5 Pro, I found nighttime video from the Action 6 to be considerably cleaner. DJI also improved the Night setting itself: video is cleaner, noise reduction is applied less aggressively and everything looks more natural. The new sensor and variable aperture also help DJI’s Rocksteady 3.0 digital stabilization in low light. If you’re filming from a bicycle at night, for instance, the Action 6 will use a higher shutter speed than the Action 5, so video will be sharper. That helps the stabilization algorithm produce a better result with less pixelation and tearing. In daylight conditions, the Action 6 delivers sharp, color-accurate video that can be used straight out of the camera — just like the Action 5. However, in contrasty scenarios like a sun-dappled forest trail, the Action 6 has a slight advantage. When I engaged the 10-bit D-LogM setting to boost dynamic range, I noticed that dark shadow areas had more detail and less noise than they did in footage from the Action 5 Pro or GoPro Hero 13. However, the GoPro Hero 13’s extra resolution is an advantage if you mostly use YouTube and other horizontal formats. With up to 5,312 x 2,988 pixels at 60 fps, it offers sharper 4K video after supersampling and more room to reframe shots in post production without any loss in quality. DJI Osmo Action 6's \"Custom\" square format shown with gridlines enabled Steve Dent for Engadget If you like shooting wide but hate the distortion, DJI’s Natural Wide field of view is a nice addition. The regular Wide setting tends to distort vertical lines, but Natural Wide keeps everything nice and straight while providing a greater field of view. Finally, I tested the Action 6’s new Film Tone feature that borrows a trick from Fujifilm’s simulations. It’s a way to get some fun looks straight out of the camera, like “pristine and cool tones” or “classic negative film type.”. The results are great for anyone who doesn’t want to fiddle with color in post-production, though DJI needs to add a few more options like black and white or sepia. Other updates With its bigger sensor the Osmo Action 6 is slightly larger than the Action 5 Pro in all dimensions, but around the same weight at 5.26 ounces. As before, it can connect to up to two DJI wireless microphones at once, including the Mic 2, Mic 3 and Mic Mini. And it comes with DJI’s new dual-latch Quick-Release Adapter Mount that can be attached in either direction, but supports all of DJI’s past accessories. Unlike its competition, the Osmo Action 6 comes with 50GB of internal memory (up from 47GB before) along with a microSD card slot. That means you won’t be screwed if you forget a memory card, as most of us have done at one point or another. DJI also doubled the Wi-Fi transfer speeds to 80MB/s and boosted USB-C transfer rates to 800MB/s.

Earlier this month, HumanSignal acquired Erud AI and launched its physical Frontier Data Labs for novel data collection. But creating data is only half the challenge.

He pointed to high-stakes applications like healthcare and legal advice as examples where the cost of errors remains prohibitively high.The connection between data labeling and AI evaluation runs deeper than semantics. Both activities require the same fundamental capabilities:Structured interfaces for human judgment: Whether reviewers are labeling images for training data or assessing whether an agent correctly orchestrated multiple tools, they need purpose-built interfaces to capture their assessments systematically.Multi-reviewer consensus: High-quality training datasets require multiple labelers who reconcile disagreements. High-quality evaluation requires the same — multiple experts assessing outputs and resolving differences in judgment.Domain expertise at scale: Training modern AI systems requires subject matter experts, not just crowd workers clicking buttons.

          "title": "Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a classic still worth the challenge",
          "standfirst": "Square Enix loves to remaster, remake and reheat its RPGs. The latest title to get the treatment is the critically acclaimed Final Fantasy spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics.Tactics has undergone its own remakes before, with War of the Lions bringing the game to the PlayStation Portable and, eventually, iOS and Android. However, now across all the major consoles, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a different remake again – and even dismisses some of the characters and additions in War of the Lions. I never finished either version, and two things are apparent: I have missed out, and this is hard.Originally released just a few months after Final Fantasy VII, which introduced polygon characters, FMV and more, Tactics’ sprite aesthetic seemed quaint in comparison. With compact isometric levels, turn-based battles are closer to Tactics Ogre and Disgaea than the lineup and strike battles of mainline Final Fantasy games of the time. The game was a critical hit, even if it didn’t match the popularity of Cloud et al. Tactics is far less forgiving. Battle dynamics lean heavily on random number generation; your squad is often outnumbered, and you can easily be undone when resurrection spells and defensive magic fail to land. The first time my revival spell failed, I audibly swore at my Switch 2. But the taste of defeat? It’s usually seasoned just right. It’s gaming umami. I wanted more, even at the notorious difficulty spike in a battle against knight-gone-wrong Wiegraf. In this fight, I faced him, a far more powerful fighter, solo, and proceeded to die roughly 20 times in a row. On standard difficulty, you rarely have to do this, but I had to craft a specialized version of the protagonist that could hit hard, heal himself, and generally just stay alive long enough for the second stage of this fight. The Ivalice Chronicles can be played in two ways. The modern version features high-resolution sprites, backgrounds, and effects, while retaining the original’s isometric view, which can be rotated and tilted for the best view of the action.

          "content": "Square Enix loves to remaster, remake and reheat its RPGs. The latest title to get the treatment is the critically acclaimed Final Fantasy spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics.Tactics has undergone its own remakes before, with War of the Lions bringing the game to the PlayStation Portable and, eventually, iOS and Android. However, now across all the major consoles, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a different remake again – and even dismisses some of the characters and additions in War of the Lions. I never finished either version, and two things are apparent: I have missed out, and this is hard.Originally released just a few months after Final Fantasy VII, which introduced polygon characters, FMV and more, Tactics’ sprite aesthetic seemed quaint in comparison. With compact isometric levels, turn-based battles are closer to Tactics Ogre and Disgaea than the lineup and strike battles of mainline Final Fantasy games of the time. The game was a critical hit, even if it didn’t match the popularity of Cloud et al. Tactics is far less forgiving. Battle dynamics lean heavily on random number generation; your squad is often outnumbered, and you can easily be undone when resurrection spells and defensive magic fail to land. The first time my revival spell failed, I audibly swore at my Switch 2. But the taste of defeat? It’s usually seasoned just right. It’s gaming umami. I wanted more, even at the notorious difficulty spike in a battle against knight-gone-wrong Wiegraf. In this fight, I faced him, a far more powerful fighter, solo, and proceeded to die roughly 20 times in a row. On standard difficulty, you rarely have to do this, but I had to craft a specialized version of the protagonist that could hit hard, heal himself, and generally just stay alive long enough for the second stage of this fight. The Ivalice Chronicles can be played in two ways. The modern version features high-resolution sprites, backgrounds, and effects, while retaining the original’s isometric view, which can be rotated and tilted for the best view of the action.

That’s $150 off the list price and equal to the all-time low (give or take a single cent) we saw on Prime Day. They may no longer be Sony’s flagship noise-canceling headphones, but if the WH-1000XM6 are out of your price range, these former Engadget favorites are well worth considering at this heavily reduced price. We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 review, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t entirely baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are. Naturally, the WH-1000XM6 that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they're on sale now for $398 for Black Friday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you're willing to spend a bit more. However, we still think the XM5 deal is the best value for most people here.

Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

However, we don't get to test out as many fridges as we like simply because they're large and difficult to move around. That said, now that Samsung has been putting AI inside of its fancy iceboxes for a few years, I wanted to do a long-term review of one of its latest models — the Bespoke AI 4-door refrigerator — to see firsthand if adding machine learning to an appliance improves its performance. But what I quickly learned is that my favorite thing about the fridge isn't AI but instead an innovative twist on the traditional water pitcher. Samsung's Beverage Center is hidden behind a thin panel on the left so the water dispenser doesn't become an eyesore. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Samsung calls it the Beverage Center and it's actually been around since 2021. It started out as a feature exclusive to the company's top-of-the-line model, but more recently, it's become so popular that Samsung began adding it to a wider range of products. Instead of having a basic water dispenser on the outside of a fridge (which is frankly kind of an eyesore), Samsung moved it behind a thin door. It then added another station right next that big enough to hold a water pitcher that automatically refills itself every time you use it. My biggest gripe with traditional water dispensers is that they're too slow. If you're only filling up a single glass, it's not a big deal. But if you're trying to top up a water bottle or get water for the entire family before dinner, you're often forced to stand in front of the fridge for a few minutes, blocking others from getting in and generally being in people's way. With the Beverage Center, you still have the option to fill a glass individually, or you can pull the entire pitcher out, carry it over to your table and fill everyone's cup with haste like a waiter at a restaurant. Sure, this might only save you a few minutes, but when you're rushing to get dinner done before your kids start getting hangry, every second is precious. After all, six o'clock is dinner time — not 6:05 or 6:10. Samsung's Beverage Center features a traditional water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that automatically refills itself after each use. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I'd also argue that a pitcher is slightly more elegant than waiting for the weak stream from your water dispenser to lazily fill up a cup. But more importantly, because the whole pitcher is sitting inside a chilled fridge, all of the water is cold — not just the first 12 or 16 ounces you typically get from that little spigot. Also, because there's a strainer basket, you can even use it to make infused water just by throwing some fruit or herbs in there. And once again, you never need to refill it manually because when the pitcher is empty, you just put it back in the fridge and the next time you grab it, it's already full again. But don't just take it from me, there are numerous threads where other users acknowledge the greatness of Samsung's Beverage Center. Samsung's Beverage Center comes with a built-in pitcher that holds 48 ounces of water and includes a strainer for making infused water or even iced tea. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, this feature isn't perfect. Samsung's pitcher isn't dishwasher safe, though that's not a huge deal because it's quick and easy to clean with warm soapy water. The bigger issue is that sometimes I wish the pitcher had more capacity or that Samsung offered the option to upgrade to a bigger one. In my experience, 48 ounces is just enough for my family of four, but I wouldn't be surprised if people with larger households might want something with more volume. One of the nice things about Samsung's Beverage Center is that you still get room on the reverse side for holding things in the door of the fridge. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Honestly, Samsung's Beverage Center feels like one of the ingenious inventions that makes you wonder why another company didn't think of this sooner. But none did, and because Samsung holds some patents related to its automatic water pitcher, you probably won't see a similar feature on any of its competitors' fridges anytime soon. As for the rest of the fridge and its AI Vision technology, I'm still testing those out, but stay tuned for a full review soon.

As for the rest of the fridge and its AI Vision technology, I'm still testing those out, but stay tuned for a full review soon.

          "title": "Salesforce Agentforce Observability lets you watch your AI agents think in near-real time",
          "standfirst": "Salesforce launched a suite of monitoring tools on Thursday designed to solve what has become one of the thorniest problems in corporate artificial intelligence: Once companies deploy AI agents to handle real customer interactions, they often have no idea how those agents are making decisions.The new capabilities, built into Salesforce&#x27;s Agentforce 360 Platform, give organizations granular visibility into every action their AI agents take, every reasoning step they follow, and every guardrail they trigger. The move comes as businesses grapple with a fundamental tension in AI adoption — the technology promises massive efficiency gains, but executives remain wary of autonomous systems they can&#x27;t fully understand or control.\"You can&#x27;t scale what you can&#x27;t see,\" said Adam Evans, executive vice president and general manager of Salesforce AI, in a statement announcing the release. The company says businesses have increased AI implementation by 282% recently, creating an urgent need for monitoring systems that can track fleets of AI agents making real-world business decisions.The challenge Salesforce aims to address is deceptively simple: AI agents work, but no one knows why. A customer service bot might successfully resolve a tax question or schedule an appointment, but the business deploying it can&#x27;t trace the reasoning path that led to that outcome. When something goes wrong — or when the agent encounters an edge case — companies lack the diagnostic tools to understand what happened.\"Agentforce Observability acts as a mission control system to not just monitor, but also analyze and optimize agent performance,\" said Gary Lerhaupt, vice president of Salesforce AI who leads the company&#x27;s observability work, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. He emphasized that the system delivers business-specific metrics that traditional monitoring tools miss. \"In service, this could be engagement or deflection rate. In sales, it could be leads assigned, converted, or reply rates.\"How AI monitoring tools helped 1-800Accountant and Reddit track autonomous agent decision-makingThe stakes become clear in early customer deployments. Ryan Teeples, chief technology officer at 1-800Accountant, said his company deployed Agentforce agents to serve as a 24/7 digital workforce handling complex tax inquiries and appointment scheduling. The AI draws on integrated data from audit logs, customer support history, and sources like IRS publications to provide instant responses — without human intervention.For a financial services firm handling sensitive tax information during peak season, the inability to see how the AI was making decisions would be a dealbreaker. \"With this level of sensitive information and the fast pace in which we move during tax season in particular, Observability allows us to have full trust and transparency with every agent interaction in one unified view,\" Teeples said.The observability tools revealed insights Teeples didn&#x27;t expect. \"The optimization feature has been the most eye opening for us — giving full observability into agent reasoning, identifying performance gaps and revealing how our agents are making decisions,\" he said. \"This has helped us quickly diagnose issues that would&#x27;ve otherwise gone undetected and configure guardrails in response.\"The business impact proved substantial. Agentforce resolved over 1,000 client engagements in the first 24 hours at 1-800Accountant. The company now projects it can support 40% client growth this year without recruiting and training seasonal staff, while freeing up 50% more time for CPAs to focus on complex advisory work rather than administrative tasks.Reddit has seen similar results since deploying the technology. John Thompson, vice president of sales strategy and operations at the social media platform, said the company has deflected 46% of support cases since launching Agentforce for advertiser support. \"By observing every Agentforce interaction, we can understand exactly how our AI navigates advertisers through even the most complex tools,\" Thompson said. \"This insight helps us understand not just whether issues are resolved, but how decisions are made along the way.\"Inside Salesforce&#x27;s session tracing technology: Logging every AI agent interaction and reasoning stepSalesforce built the observability system on two foundational components. The Session Tracing Data Model logs every interaction — user inputs, agent responses, reasoning steps, language model calls, and guardrail checks — and stores them securely in Data 360, Salesforce&#x27;s data platform. This creates what the company calls \"unified visibility\" into agent behavior at the session level.The second component, MuleSoft Agent Fabric, addresses a problem that will become more acute as companies build more AI systems: agent sprawl. The tool provides what Lerhaupt describes as \"a single pane of glass across every agent,\" including those built outside the Salesforce ecosystem. Agent Fabric&#x27;s Agent Visualizer creates a visual map of a company&#x27;s entire agent network, giving visibility across all agent interactions from a single dashboard.The observability tools break down into three functional areas. Agent Analytics tracks performance metrics, surfaces KPI trends over time, and highlights ineffective topics or actions. Agent Optimization provides end-to-end visibility of every interaction, groups similar requests to uncover patterns, and identifies configuration issues. Agent Health Monitoring, which will become generally available in Spring 2026, tracks key health metrics in near real-time and sends alerts on critical errors and latency spikes.Pierre Matuchet, senior vice president of IT and digital transformation at Adecco, said the visibility helped his team build confidence even before full deployment. \"Even during early notebook testing, we saw the agent handle unexpected scenarios, like when candidates didn&#x27;t want to answer questions already covered in their CVs, appropriately and as designed,\" Matuchet said. \"Agentforce Observability helped us identify unanticipated user behavior and gave us confidence, even before the agent went live, that it could act responsibly and reliably.\"Why Salesforce says its AI observability tools beat Microsoft, Google, and AWS monitoringThe announcement puts Salesforce in direct competition with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services, all of which offer monitoring capabilities built into their AI agent platforms. Lerhaupt argued that enterprises need more than the basic monitoring those providers offer.\"Observability comes out-of-the-box standard with Agentforce at no extra cost,\" Lerhaupt said, positioning the offering as comprehensive rather than supplementary. He emphasized that the tools provide \"deeper insight than ever before\" by capturing \"the full telemetry and reasoning behind every agentic interaction\" through the Session Tracing Data Model, then using that data to \"provide key analysis and session quality scoring to help customers optimize and improve their agents.\"The competitive positioning matters because enterprises face a choice: build their AI infrastructure on a cloud provider&#x27;s platform and use its native monitoring tools, or adopt a specialized observability layer like Salesforce&#x27;s. Lerhaupt framed the decision as one of depth versus breadth. \"Enterprises need more than basic monitoring to measure the success of their AI deployments,\" he said. \"They need full visibility into every agent interaction and decision.\"The 1.2 billion workflow question: Are AI agent deployments moving from pilot projects to production?The broader question is whether Salesforce is solving a problem most enterprises will face imminently or building for a future that remains years away. The company&#x27;s 282% surge in AI implementation sounds dramatic, but that figure doesn&#x27;t distinguish between production deployments and pilot projects.When asked about this directly, Lerhaupt pointed to customer examples rather than offering a breakdown. He described a three-phase journey from experimentation to scale. \"On Day 0, trust is the foundation,\" he said, citing 1-800Accountant&#x27;s 70% autonomous resolution of chat engagements. \"Day 1 is where designing ideas to become real, usable AI,\" with Williams Sonoma delivering more than 150,000 AI experiences monthly. \"On Day 2, once trust and design are built, it becomes about scaling early wins into enterprise-wide outcomes,\" pointing to Falabella&#x27;s 600,000 AI workflows per month that have grown fourfold in three months.Lerhaupt said Salesforce has 12,000-plus customers across 39 countries running Agentforce, powering 1.2 billion agentic workflows. Those numbers suggest the shift from pilot to production is already underway at scale, though the company didn&#x27;t provide a breakdown of how many customers are running production workloads versus experimental deployments.The economics of AI deployment may accelerate adoption regardless of readiness. Companies face mounting pressure to reduce headcount costs while maintaining or improving service levels. AI agents promise to resolve that tension, but only if businesses can trust them to work reliably. Observability tools like Salesforce&#x27;s represent the trust layer that makes scaled deployment possible.What happens after AI agent deployment: Why continuous monitoring matters more than initial testingThe deeper story is about a shift in how enterprises think about AI deployment. The official announcement framed this clearly: \"The agent development lifecycle begins with three foundational steps: build, test, and deploy. While many organizations have already moved past the initial hurdle of creating their first agents, the real enterprise challenge starts immediately after deployment.\"That framing reflects a maturing understanding of AI in production environments. Early AI deployments often treated the technology as a one-time implementation — build it, test it, ship it. But AI agents behave differently than traditional software. They learn, adapt, and make decisions based on probabilistic models rather than deterministic code. That means their behavior can drift over time, or they can develop unexpected failure modes that only emerge under real-world conditions.\"Building an agent is just the beginning,\" Lerhaupt said. \"Once the trust is built for agents to begin handling real work, companies may start by seeing the results, but may not understand the &#x27;why&#x27; behind them or see areas to optimize. Customers interact with products—including agents—in unexpected ways and to optimize the customer experience, transparency around agent behavior and outcomes is critical.\"Teeples made the same point more bluntly when asked what would be different without observability tools. \"This level of visibility has given full trust in continuing to expand our agent deployment,\" he said. The implication is clear: without visibility, deployment would slow or stop. 1-800Accountant plans to expand Slack integrations for internal workflows, deploy Service Cloud Voice for case deflection, and leverage Tableau for conversational analytics—all dependent on the confidence that observability provides.How enterprise AI trust issues became the biggest barrier to scaling autonomous agentsThe recurring theme in customer interviews is trust, or rather, the lack of it. AI agents work, sometimes spectacularly well, but executives don&#x27;t trust them enough to deploy them widely. Observability tools aim to convert black-box systems into transparent ones, replacing faith with evidence.This matters because trust is the bottleneck constraining AI adoption, not technological capability. The models are powerful enough, the infrastructure is mature enough, and the business case is compelling enough. What&#x27;s missing is executive confidence that AI agents will behave predictably and that problems can be diagnosed and fixed quickly when they arise.Salesforce is betting that observability tools can remove that bottleneck. The company positions Agentforce Observability not as a monitoring tool but as a management layer—\"just like managers work with their human employees to ensure they are working towards the right objectives and optimizing performance,\" Lerhaupt said.The analogy is telling. If AI agents are becoming digital employees, they need the same kind of ongoing supervision, feedback, and optimization that human employees receive. The difference is that AI agents can be monitored with far more granularity than any human worker. Every decision, every reasoning step, every data point consulted can be logged, analyzed, and scored.That creates both opportunity and obligation. The opportunity is continuous improvement at a pace impossible with human workers. The obligation is to actually use that data to optimize agent performance, not just collect it. Whether enterprises can build the organizational processes to turn observability data into systematic improvement remains an open question.But one thing has become increasingly clear in the race to deploy AI at scale: Companies that can see what their agents are doing will move faster than those flying blind. In the emerging era of autonomous AI, observability isn&#x27;t just a nice-to-have feature. It&#x27;s the difference between cautious experimentation and confident deployment—between treating AI as a risky bet and managing it as a trusted workforce. The question is no longer whether AI agents can work. It&#x27;s whether businesses can see well enough to let them.",

The paradigm, called Nested Learning, reframes a model and its training not as a single process, but as a system of nested, multi-level optimization problems. The researchers argue that this approach can unlock more expressive learning algorithms, leading to better in-context learning and memory.To prove their concept, the researchers used Nested Learning to develop a new model, called Hope. Initial experiments show that it has superior performance on language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks, potentially paving the way for efficient AI systems that can adapt to real-world environments.The memory problem of large language modelsDeep learning algorithms helped obviate the need for the careful engineering and domain expertise required by traditional machine learning. By feeding models vast amounts of data, they could learn the necessary representations on their own. However, this approach presented its own set of challenges that couldn’t be solved by simply stacking more layers or creating larger networks, such as generalizing to new data, continually learning new tasks, and avoiding suboptimal solutions during training.Efforts to overcome these challenges led to the innovations that led to Transformers, the foundation of today&#x27;s large language models (LLMs). These models have ushered in \"a paradigm shift from task-specific models to more general-purpose systems with various emergent capabilities as a result of scaling the &#x27;right&#x27; architectures,\" the researchers write. Still, a fundamental limitation remains: LLMs are largely static after training and can&#x27;t update their core knowledge or acquire new skills from new interactions.The only adaptable component of an LLM is its in-context learning ability, which allows it to perform tasks based on information provided in its immediate prompt. This makes current LLMs analogous to a person who can&#x27;t form new long-term memories. Their knowledge is limited to what they learned during pre-training (the distant past) and what&#x27;s in their current context window (the immediate present). Once a conversation exceeds the context window, that information is lost forever.The problem is that today’s transformer-based LLMs have no mechanism for “online” consolidation. Information in the context window never updates the model’s long-term parameters — the weights stored in its feed-forward layers. As a result, the model can’t permanently acquire new knowledge or skills from interactions; anything it learns disappears as soon as the context window rolls over.A nested approach to learningNested Learning (NL) is designed to allow computational models to learn from data using different levels of abstraction and time-scales, much like the brain. It treats a single machine learning model not as one continuous process, but as a system of interconnected learning problems that are optimized simultaneously at different speeds. This is a departure from the classic view, which treats a model&#x27;s architecture and its optimization algorithm as two separate components.Under this paradigm, the training process is viewed as developing an \"associative memory,\" the ability to connect and recall related pieces of information. The model learns to map a data point to its local error, which measures how \"surprising\" that data point was. Even key architectural components like the attention mechanism in transformers can be seen as simple associative memory modules that learn mappings between tokens. By defining an update frequency for each component, these nested optimization problems can be ordered into different \"levels,\" forming the core of the NL paradigm.Hope for continual learningThe researchers put these principles into practice with Hope, an architecture designed to embody Nested Learning. Hope is a modified version of Titans, another architecture Google introduced in January to address the transformer model&#x27;s memory limitations. While Titans had a powerful memory system, its parameters were updated at only two different speeds: a long-term memory module and a short-term memory mechanism.Hope is a self-modifying architecture augmented with a \"Continuum Memory System\" (CMS) that enables unbounded levels of in-context learning and scales to larger context windows. The CMS acts like a series of memory banks, each updating at a different frequency. Faster-updating banks handle immediate information, while slower ones consolidate more abstract knowledge over longer periods. This allows the model to optimize its own memory in a self-referential loop, creating an architecture with theoretically infinite learning levels.On a diverse set of language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks, Hope demonstrated lower perplexity (a measure of how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence and maintains coherence in the text it generates) and higher accuracy compared to both standard transformers and other modern recurrent models. Hope also performed better on long-context \"Needle-In-Haystack\" tasks, where a model must find and use a specific piece of information hidden within a large volume of text. This suggests its CMS offers a more efficient way to handle long information sequences.This is one of several efforts to create AI systems that process information at different levels. Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) by Sapient Intelligence, used a hierarchical architecture to make the model more efficient in learning reasoning tasks. Tiny Reasoning Model (TRM), a model by Samsung, improves HRM by making architectural changes, improving its performance while making it more efficient.While promising, Nested Learning faces some of the same challenges of these other paradigms in realizing its full potential. Current AI hardware and software stacks are heavily optimized for classic deep learning architectures and Transformer models in particular. Adopting Nested Learning at scale may require fundamental changes. However, if it gains traction, it could lead to far more efficient LLMs that can continually learn, a capability crucial for real-world enterprise applications where environments, data, and user needs are in constant flux.",

          "title": "Grok 4.1 Fast's compelling dev access and Agent Tools API overshadowed by Musk glazing",
          "standfirst": "Elon Musk&#x27;s frontier generative AI startup xAI formally opened developer access to its Grok 4.1 Fast models last night and introduced a new Agent Tools API—but the technical milestones were immediately subverted by a wave of public ridicule about Grok&#x27;s responses on the social network X over the last few days praising its creator Musk as more athletic than championship-winning American football players and legendary boxer Mike Tyson, despite having displayed no public prowess at either sport.They emerge as yet another black eye for xAI&#x27;s Grok following the \"MechaHitler\" scandal in the summer of 2025, in which an earlier version of Grok adopted a verbally antisemitic persona inspired by the late German dictator and Holocaust architect, and an incident in May 2025 which it replied to X users to discuss unfounded claims of \"white genocide\" in Musk&#x27;s home country of South Africa to unrelated subject matter.This time, X users shared dozens of examples of Grok alleging Musk was stronger or more performant than elite athletes and a greater thinker than luminaries such as Albert Einstein, sparking questions about the AI&#x27;s reliability, bias controls, adversarial prompting defenses, and the credibility of xAI’s public claims about “maximally truth-seeking” models. .Against this backdrop, xAI’s actual developer-focused announcement—the first-ever API availability for Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning, Grok 4.1 Fast Non-Reasoning, and the Agent Tools API—landed in a climate dominated by memes, skepticism, and renewed scrutiny.How the Grok Musk Glazing Controversy Overshadowed the API ReleaseAlthough Grok 4.1 was announced on the evening of Monday, November 17, 2025 as available to consumers via the X and Grok apps and websites, the API launch announced last night, on November 19, was intended to mark a developer-focused expansion. Instead, the conversation across X shifted sharply toward Grok’s behavior in consumer channels.Between November 17–20, users discovered that Grok would frequently deliver exaggerated, implausible praise for Musk when prompted—sometimes subtly, often brazenly. Responses declaring Musk “more fit than LeBron James,” a superior quarterback to Peyton Manning, or “smarter than Albert Einstein” gained massive engagement. When paired with identical prompts substituting “Bill Gates” or other figures, Grok often responded far more critically, suggesting inconsistent preference handling or latent alignment drift.Screenshots spread by high-engagement accounts (e.g., @SilvermanJacob, @StatisticUrban) framed Grok as unreliable or compromised.Memetic commentary—“Elon’s only friend is Grok”—became shorthand for perceived sycophancy.Media coverage, including a November 20 report from The Verge, characterized Grok’s responses as “weird worship,” highlighting claims that Musk is “as smart as da Vinci” and “fitter than LeBron James.”Critical threads argued that Grok’s design choices replicated past alignment failures, such as a July 2025 incident where Grok generated problematic praise of Adolf Hitler under certain prompting conditions.The viral nature of the glazing overshadowed the technical release and complicated xAI’s messaging about accuracy and trustworthiness.Implications for Developer Adoption and TrustThe juxtaposition of a major API release with a public credibility crisis raises several concerns:Alignment Controls The glazing behavior suggests that prompt adversariality may expose latent preference biases, undermining claims of “truth-maximization.”Brand Contamination Across Deployment Contexts Though the consumer chatbot and API-accessible model share lineage, developers may conflate the reliability of both—even if safeguards differ.Risk in Agentic Systems The Agent Tools API gives Grok abilities such as web search, code execution, and document retrieval. Bias-driven misjudgments in those contexts could have material consequences.Regulatory Scrutiny Biased outputs that systematically favor a CEO or public figure could attract attention from consumer protection regulators evaluating AI representational neutrality.Developer Hesitancy Early adopters may wait for evidence that the model version exposed through the API is not subject to the same glazing behaviors seen in consumer channels.Musk himself attempted to defuse the situation with a self-deprecating X post this evening, writing:“Grok was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me. For the record, I am a fat retard.”While intended to signal transparency, the admission did not directly address whether the root cause was adversarial prompting alone or whether model training introduced unintentional positive priors. Nor did it clarify whether the API-exposed versions of Grok 4.1 Fast differ meaningfully from the consumer version that produced the offending outputs.Until xAI provides deeper technical detail about prompt vulnerabilities, preference modeling, and safety guardrails, the controversy is likely to persist.Two Grok 4.1 Models Available on xAI APIAlthough consumers using Grok apps gained access to Grok 4.1 Fast earlier in the week, developers could not previously use the model through the xAI API. The latest release closes that gap by adding two new models to the public model catalog:grok-4-1-fast-reasoning — designed for maximal reasoning performance and complex tool workflowsgrok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning — optimized for extremely fast responsesBoth models support a 2 million–token context window, aligning them with xAI’s long-context roadmap and providing substantial headroom for multistep agent tasks, document processing, and research workflows.The new additions appear alongside updated entries in xAI’s pricing and rate-limit tables, confirming that they now function as first-class API endpoints across xAI infrastructure and routing partners such as OpenRouter.Agent Tools API: A New Server-Side Tool LayerThe other major component of the announcement is the Agent Tools API, which introduces a unified mechanism for Grok to call tools across a range of capabilities:Search Tools including a direct link to X (Twitter) search for real-time conversations and web search for broad external retrieval.Files Search: Retrieval and citation of relevant documents uploaded by usersCode Execution: A secure Python sandbox for analysis, simulation, and data processingMCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration: Connects Grok agents with third-party tools or custom enterprise systemsxAI emphasizes that the API handles all infrastructure complexity—including sandboxing, key management, rate limiting, and environment orchestration—on the server side. Developers simply declare which tools are available, and Grok autonomously decides when and how to invoke them. The company highlights that the model frequently performs multi-tool, multi-turn workflows in parallel, reducing latency for complex tasks.How the New API Layer Leverages Grok 4.1 FastWhile the model existed before today’s API release, Grok 4.1 Fast was trained explicitly for tool-calling performance. The model’s long-horizon reinforcement learning tuning supports autonomous planning, which is essential for agent systems that chain multiple operations.Key behaviors highlighted by xAI include:Consistent output quality across the full 2M token context window, enabled by long-horizon RLReduced hallucination rate, cut in half compared with Grok 4 Fast while maintaining Grok 4’s factual accuracy performanceParallel tool use, where Grok executes multiple tool calls concurrently when solving multi-step problemsAdaptive reasoning, allowing the model to plan tool sequences over several turnsThis behavior aligns directly with the Agent Tools API’s purpose: to give Grok the external capabilities necessary for autonomous agent work.Benchmark Results Demonstrating Highest Agentic PerformancexAI released a set of benchmark results intended to illustrate how Grok 4.1 Fast performs when paired with the Agent Tools API, emphasizing scenarios that rely on tool calling, long-context reasoning, and multi-step task execution. On τ²-bench Telecom, a benchmark built to replicate real-world customer-support workflows involving tool use, Grok 4.1 Fast achieved the highest score among all listed models — outpacing even Google&#x27;s new Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI&#x27;s recent 5.1 on high reasoning — while also achieving among the lowest prices for developers and users. The evaluation, independently verified by Artificial Analysis, cost $105 to complete and served as one of xAI’s central claims of superiority in agentic performance.In structured function-calling tests, Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning recorded a 72 percent overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling v4 benchmark, a result accompanied by a reported cost of $400 for the run. xAI noted that Gemini 3 Pro’s comparative result in this benchmark stemmed from independent estimates rather than an official submission, leaving some uncertainty in cross-model comparisons.Long-horizon evaluations further underscored the model’s design emphasis on stability across large contexts. In multi-turn tests involving extended dialog and expanded context windows, Grok 4.1 Fast outperformed both Grok 4 Fast and the earlier Grok 4, aligning with xAI’s claims that long-horizon reinforcement learning helped mitigate the typical degradation seen in models operating at the two-million-token scale.A second cluster of benchmarks—Research-Eval, FRAMES, and X Browse—highlighted Grok 4.1 Fast’s capabilities in tool-augmented research tasks. Across all three evaluations, Grok 4.1 Fast paired with the Agent Tools API earned the highest scores among the models with published results. It also delivered the lowest average cost per query in Research-Eval and FRAMES, reinforcing xAI’s messaging on cost-efficient research performance. In X Browse, an internal xAI benchmark assessing multihop search capabilities across the X platform, Grok 4.1 Fast again led its peers, though Gemini 3 Pro lacked cost data for direct comparison.Developer Pricing and Temporary Free AccessAPI pricing for Grok 4.1 Fast is as follows:Input tokens: $0.20 per 1MCached input tokens: $0.05 per 1MOutput tokens: $0.50 per 1MTool calls: From $5 per 1,000 successful tool invocationsTo facilitate early experimentation:Grok 4.1 Fast is free on OpenRouter until December 3rd.The Agent Tools API is also free through December 3rd via the xAI API.When paying for the models outside of the free period, Grok 4.1 Fast reasoning and non-reasoning are both among the cheaper options from major frontier labs through their own APIs.

Across multiple agentic and function-calling benchmarks, the model consistently outperforms or matches leading systems like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1 (high), and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, while operating inside a far more economical cost envelope. At $0.70 per million tokens, both Grok 4.1 Fast variants sit only marginally above ultracheap models like Qwen 3 Turbo but deliver accuracy levels in line with systems that cost 10–20× more per unit. The τ²-bench Telecom results reinforce this value proposition: Grok 4.1 Fast not only achieved the highest score in its test cohort but also appears to be the lowest-cost model in that benchmark run. In practical terms, this gives enterprises an unusually favorable cost-to-intelligence ratio, particularly for workloads involving multistep planning, tool use, and long-context reasoning.However, performance and pricing are only part of the equation for organizations considering large-scale adoption. The recent “glazing” controversy from Grok’s consumer deployment on X — combined with the earlier \"MechaHitler\" and \"White Genocid\" incidents — expose credibility and trust-surface risks that enterprises cannot ignore. Even if the API models are technically distinct from the consumer-facing variant, the inability to prevent sycophantic, adversarially-induced bias in a high-visibility environment raises legitimate concerns about downstream reliability in operational contexts. Enterprise procurement teams will rightly ask whether similar vulnerabilities—preference skew, alignment drift, or context-sensitive bias—could surface when Grok is connected to production databases, workflow engines, code-execution tools, or research pipelines.The introduction of the Agent Tools API raises the stakes further. Grok 4.1 Fast is not just a text generator—it is now an orchestrator of web searches, X-data queries, document retrieval operations, and remote Python execution. These agentic capabilities amplify productivity but also expand the blast radius of any misalignment. A model that can over-index on flattering a public figure could, in principle, also misprioritize results, mis-handle safety boundaries, or deliver skewed interpretations when operating with real-world data. Enterprises therefore need a clear understanding of how xAI isolates, audits, and hardens its API models relative to the consumer-facing Grok whose failures drove the latest scrutiny.The result is a mixed strategic picture. On performance and price, Grok 4.1 Fast is highly competitive—arguably one of the strongest value propositions in the modern LLM market. But xAI’s enterprise appeal will ultimately depend on whether the company can convincingly demonstrate that the alignment instability, susceptibility to adversarial prompting, and bias-amplifying behavior observed on X do not translate into its developer-facing platform. Without transparent safeguards, auditability, and reproducible evaluation across the very tools that enable autonomous operation, organizations may hesitate to commit core workloads to a system whose reliability is still the subject of public doubt. For now, Grok 4.1 Fast is a technically impressive and economically efficient option—one that enterprises should test, benchmark, and validate rigorously before allowing it to take on mission-critical tas",

In multi-turn tests involving extended dialog and expanded context windows, Grok 4.1 Fast outperformed both Grok 4 Fast and the earlier Grok 4, aligning with xAI’s claims that long-horizon reinforcement learning helped mitigate the typical degradation seen in models operating at the two-million-token scale.A second cluster of benchmarks—Research-Eval, FRAMES, and X Browse—highlighted Grok 4.1 Fast’s capabilities in tool-augmented research tasks. Across all three evaluations, Grok 4.1 Fast paired with the Agent Tools API earned the highest scores among the models with published results. It also delivered the lowest average cost per query in Research-Eval and FRAMES, reinforcing xAI’s messaging on cost-efficient research performance. In X Browse, an internal xAI benchmark assessing multihop search capabilities across the X platform, Grok 4.1 Fast again led its peers, though Gemini 3 Pro lacked cost data for direct comparison.Developer Pricing and Temporary Free AccessAPI pricing for Grok 4.1 Fast is as follows:Input tokens: $0.20 per 1MCached input tokens: $0.05 per 1MOutput tokens: $0.50 per 1MTool calls: From $5 per 1,000 successful tool invocationsTo facilitate early experimentation:Grok 4.1 Fast is free on OpenRouter until December 3rd.The Agent Tools API is also free through December 3rd via the xAI API.When paying for the models outside of the free period, Grok 4.1 Fast reasoning and non-reasoning are both among the cheaper options from major frontier labs through their own APIs.

Across multiple agentic and function-calling benchmarks, the model consistently outperforms or matches leading systems like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1 (high), and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, while operating inside a far more economical cost envelope. At $0.70 per million tokens, both Grok 4.1 Fast variants sit only marginally above ultracheap models like Qwen 3 Turbo but deliver accuracy levels in line with systems that cost 10–20× more per unit. The τ²-bench Telecom results reinforce this value proposition: Grok 4.1 Fast not only achieved the highest score in its test cohort but also appears to be the lowest-cost model in that benchmark run. In practical terms, this gives enterprises an unusually favorable cost-to-intelligence ratio, particularly for workloads involving multistep planning, tool use, and long-context reasoning.However, performance and pricing are only part of the equation for organizations considering large-scale adoption. The recent “glazing” controversy from Grok’s consumer deployment on X — combined with the earlier \"MechaHitler\" and \"White Genocid\" incidents — expose credibility and trust-surface risks that enterprises cannot ignore. Even if the API models are technically distinct from the consumer-facing variant, the inability to prevent sycophantic, adversarially-induced bias in a high-visibility environment raises legitimate concerns about downstream reliability in operational contexts. Enterprise procurement teams will rightly ask whether similar vulnerabilities—preference skew, alignment drift, or context-sensitive bias—could surface when Grok is connected to production databases, workflow engines, code-execution tools, or research pipelines.The introduction of the Agent Tools API raises the stakes further. Grok 4.1 Fast is not just a text generator—it is now an orchestrator of web searches, X-data queries, document retrieval operations, and remote Python execution. These agentic capabilities amplify productivity but also expand the blast radius of any misalignment. A model that can over-index on flattering a public figure could, in principle, also misprioritize results, mis-handle safety boundaries, or deliver skewed interpretations when operating with real-world data. Enterprises therefore need a clear understanding of how xAI isolates, audits, and hardens its API models relative to the consumer-facing Grok whose failures drove the latest scrutiny.The result is a mixed strategic picture. On performance and price, Grok 4.1 Fast is highly competitive—arguably one of the strongest value propositions in the modern LLM market. But xAI’s enterprise appeal will ultimately depend on whether the company can convincingly demonstrate that the alignment instability, susceptibility to adversarial prompting, and bias-amplifying behavior observed on X do not translate into its developer-facing platform. Without transparent safeguards, auditability, and reproducible evaluation across the very tools that enable autonomous operation, organizations may hesitate to commit core workloads to a system whose reliability is still the subject of public doubt. For now, Grok 4.1 Fast is a technically impressive and economically efficient option—one that enterprises should test, benchmark, and validate rigorously before allowing it to take on mission-critical tas",

          "standfirst": "Infographics rendered without a single spelling error. Complex diagrams one-shotted from paragraph prompts. Logos restored from fragments. And visual outputs so sharp with so much text density and accuracy, one developer simply called it “absolutely bonkers.”Google DeepMind’s newly released Nano Banana Pro—officially Gemini 3 Pro Image—has drawn astonishment from both the developer community and enterprise AI engineers. But behind the viral praise lies something more transformative: a model built not just to impress, but to integrate deeply across Google’s AI stack—from Gemini API and Vertex AI to Workspace apps, Ads, and Google AI Studio.Unlike earlier image models, which targeted casual users or artistic use cases, Gemini 3 Pro Image introduces studio-quality, multimodal image generation for structured workflows—with high resolution, multilingual accuracy, layout consistency, and real-time knowledge grounding. It’s engineered for technical buyers, orchestration teams, and enterprise-scale automation, not just creative exploration.Benchmarks already show the model outperforming peers in overall visual quality, infographic generation, and text rendering accuracy. And as real-world users push it to its limits—from medical illustrations to AI memes—the model is revealing itself as both a new creative tool and a visual reasoning system for the enterprise stack.Built for Structured Multimodal ReasoningGemini 3 Pro Image isn’t just drawing pretty pictures—it’s leveraging the reasoning layer of Gemini 3 Pro to generate visuals that communicate structure, intent, and factual grounding. The model is capable of generating UX flows, educational diagrams, storyboards, and mockups from language prompts, and can incorporate up to 14 source images with consistent identity and layout fidelity across subjects.Google describes the model as “a higher-fidelity model built on Gemini 3 Pro for developers to access studio-quality image generation,” and confirms it is now available via Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI for enterprise access.In Antigravity, Google’s new AI vibe coding platform built by the former Windsurf co-founders it hired earlier this year, Gemini 3 Pro Image is already being used to create dynamic UI prototypes with image assets rendered before code is written. The same capabilities are rolling out to Google’s enterprise-facing products like Workspace Vids, Slides, and Google Ads, giving teams precise control over asset layout, lighting, typography, and image composition.High-Resolution Output, Localization, and Real-Time GroundingThe model supports output resolutions of up to 2K and 4K, and includes studio-level controls over camera angle, color grading, focus, and lighting. It handles multilingual prompts, semantic localization, and in-image text translation, enabling workflows like:Translating packaging or signage while preserving layoutUpdating UX mockups for regional marketsGenerating consistent ad variants with product names and pricing changed by localeOne of the clearest use cases is infographics—both technical and commercial. Dr. Derya Unutmaz, an immunologist, generated a full medical illustration describing the stages of CAR-T cell therapy from lab to patient, praising the result as “perfect.” AI educator Dan Mac created a visual guide explaining transformer models “for a non-technical person” and called the result “unbelievable.”Even complex structured visuals like full restaurant menus, chalkboard lecture visuals, or multi-character comic strips have been shared online—generated in a single prompt, with coherent typography, layout, and subject continuity.Benchmarks Signal a Lead in Compositional Image GenerationIndependent GenAI-Bench results show Gemini 3 Pro Image as a state-of-the-art performer across key categories:It ranks highest in overall user preference, suggesting strong visual coherence and prompt alignment.It leads in visual quality, ahead of competitors like GPT-Image 1 and Seedream v4.Most notably, it dominates in infographic generation, outscoring even Google’s own previous model, Gemini 2.5 Flash.Additional benchmarks released by Google show Gemini 3 Pro Image with lower text error rates across multiple languages, as well as stronger performance in image editing fidelity.The difference becomes especially apparent in structured reasoning tasks. Where previous models might approximate style or fill in layout gaps, Gemini 3 Pro Image demonstrates consistency across panels, accurate spatial relationships, and context-aware detail preservation—crucial for systems generating diagrams, documentation, or training visuals at scale.Pricing Is Competitive for the QualityFor developers and enterprise teams accessing Gemini 3 Pro Image via the Gemini API or Google AI Studio, pricing is tiered by resolution and usage. Input tokens for images are priced at $0.0011 per image (equivalent to 560 tokens or $0.067 per image), while output pricing depends on resolution: standard 1K and 2K images cost approximately $0.134 each (1,120 tokens), and high-resolution 4K images cost $0.24 (2,000 tokens). Text input and output are priced in line with Gemini 3 Pro: $2.00 per million input tokens and $12.00 per million output tokens when using the model’s reasoning capabilities. The free tier currently does not include access to Nano Banana Pro, and unlike free-tier models, the paid-tier generations are not used to train Google’s systems.Here’s a comparison table of major image-generation APIs for developers/enterprises, followed by a discussion of how they stack up (including the tiered pricing for Gemini 3 Pro Image / “Nano Banana Pro”).Model / ServiceApproximate Price per Image or Token-UnitKey Notes / Resolution TiersGoogle – Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)Input (image): ~$0.067 per image (560 tokens). Output: ~$0.134 per image for 1K/2K (1120 tokens), ~$0.24 per image for 4K (2000 tokens). Text: $2.00 per million input tokens & $12.00 per million output tokens (≤200k token context) Tiered by resolution; paid-tier images are not used to train Google’s systems.OpenAI – DALL-E 3 API~ $0.04/image for 1024×1024 standard; ~$0.08/image for larger/resolution/HD. Lower cost per image; resolution and quality tiers adjust pricing.OpenAI – GPT-Image-1 (via Azure/OpenAI)Low tier ~$0.01/image; Medium ~$0.04/image; High ~$0.17/image. Token-based pricing – more complex prompts or higher resolution raise cost.Google – Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana)~$0.039 per image for 1024×1024 resolution (1290 tokens) in output. Lower cost “flash” model for high-volume, lower latency use.Other / Smaller APIs (e.g., via third-party credit systems)Examples: $0.02–$0.03 per image in some cases for lower resolution or simpler models. Often used for less demanding production use cases or draft content.The Google Gemini 3 Pro Image / Nano Banana Pro pricing sits at the upper end: ~$0.134 for 1K/2K, ~$0.24 for 4K, significantly higher than the ~$0.04 per image baseline for many OpenAI/DALL-E 3 standard images. But the higher cost might be justifiable if: you require 4K resolution; you need enterprise-grade governance (e.g., Google emphasizes that paid-tier images are not used to train their systems); you need a token-based pricing system aligned with other LLM usage; and you already operate within Google’s cloud/AI stack (e.g., using Vertex AI).On the other hand, if you’re generating large volumes of images (thousands to tens of thousands) and can accept lower resolution (1K/2K) or slightly less premium quality, the lower-cost alternatives (OpenAI, smaller models) offer meaningful savings — for instance, generating 10,000 images at ~$0.04 each costs ~$400, whereas at ~$0.134 each it’s ~$1,340. Over time, that delta adds up.SynthID and the Growing Need for Enterprise ProvenanceEvery image generated by Gemini 3 Pro Image includes SynthID, Google’s imperceptible digital watermarking system. While many platforms are just beginning to explore AI provenance, Google is positioning SynthID as a core part of its enterprise compliance stack.In the updated Gemini app, users can now upload an image and ask whether it was AI-generated by Google—a feature designed to support growing regulatory and internal governance demands.A Google blog post emphasizes that provenance is no longer a “feature” but an operational requirement, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, education, and media. SynthID also allows teams building on Google Cloud to differentiate between AI-generated content and third-party media across assets, use logs, and audit trails.Early Developer Reactions Range from Awe to Edge-Case TestingDespite the enterprise framing, early developer reactions have turned social media into a real-time proving ground.Designer Travis Davids called out a one-shot restaurant menu with flawless layout and typography: “Long generated text is officially solved.” Immunologist Dr. Derya Unutmaz posted his CAR-T diagram with the caption: “What have you done, Google?!” while Nikunj Kothari converted a full essay into a stylized blackboard lecture in one shot, calling the results “simply speechless.”Engineer Deedy Das praised its performance across editing and brand restoration tasks: “Photoshop-like editing… It nails everything...By far the best image model I&#x27;ve ever seen.” Developer Parker Ortolani summarized it more simply: “Nano Banana remains absolutely bonkers.”Even meme creators got involved. @cto_junior generated a fully styled “LLM discourse desk” meme—with logos, charts, monitors, and all—in one prompt, dubbing Gemini 3 Pro Image “your new meme engine.”But scrutiny followed, too. AI researcher Lisan al Gaib tested the model on a logic-heavy Sudoku problem, showing it hallucinated both an invalid puzzle and a nonsensical solution, noting that the model “is sadly not AGI.” The post served as a reminder that visual reasoning has limits, particularly in rule-constrained systems where hallucinated logic remains a persistent failure mode.A New Platform Primitive, Not Just a ModelGemini 3 Pro Image now lives across Google’s entire enterprise and developer stack: Google Ads, Workspace (Slides, Vids), Vertex AI, Gemini API, and Google AI Studio. It’s also deployed in internal tools like Antigravity, where design agents render layout drafts before interface elements are coded.This makes it a first-class multimodal primitive inside Google’s AI ecosystem, much like text completion or speech recognition. In enterprise applications, visuals are not decorations—they’re data, documentation, design, and communication. Whether generating onboarding explainers, prototype visuals, or localized collateral, models like Gemini 3 Pro Image allow systems to create assets programmatically, with control, scale, and consistency.At a time when the race between OpenAI, Google, and xAI is moving beyond benchmarks and into platforms, Nano Banana Pro is Google’s quiet declaration: the future of generative AI won’t just be spoken or written—it will be seen.",

          "title": "ScaleOps' new AI Infra Product slashes GPU costs for self-hosted enterprise LLMs by 50% for early adopters",
          "standfirst": "ScaleOps has expanded its cloud resource management platform with a new product aimed at enterprises operating self-hosted large language models (LLMs) and GPU-based AI applications. The AI Infra Product announced today, extends the company’s existing automation capabilities to address a growing need for efficient GPU utilization, predictable performance, and reduced operational burden in large-scale AI deployments. The company said the system is already running in enterprise production environments and delivering major efficiency gains for early adopters, reducing GPU costs by between 50% and 70%, according to the company. The company does not publicly list enterprise pricing for this solution and instead invites interested customers to receive a custom quote based on their operation size and needs here.In explaining how the system behaves under heavy load, Yodar Shafrir, CEO and Co-Founder of ScaleOps, said in an email to VentureBeat that the platform uses “proactive and reactive mechanisms to handle sudden spikes without performance impact,” noting that its workload rightsizing policies “automatically manage capacity to keep resources available.” He added that minimizing GPU cold-start delays was a priority, emphasizing that the system “ensures instant response when traffic surges,” particularly for AI workloads where model load times are substantial.Expanding Resource Automation to AI InfrastructureEnterprises deploying self-hosted AI models face performance variability, long load times, and persistent underutilization of GPU resources. ScaleOps positioned the new AI Infra Product as a direct response to these issues. The platform allocates and scales GPU resources in real time and adapts to changes in traffic demand without requiring alterations to existing model deployment pipelines or application code.According to ScaleOps, the system manages production environments for organizations including Wiz, DocuSign, Rubrik, Coupa, Alkami, Vantor, Grubhub, Island, Chewy, and several Fortune 500 companies. The AI Infra Product introduces workload-aware scaling policies that proactively and reactively adjust capacity to maintain performance during demand spikes. The company stated that these policies reduce the cold-start delays associated with loading large AI models, which improves responsiveness when traffic increases.Technical Integration and Platform CompatibilityThe product is designed for compatibility with common enterprise infrastructure patterns. It works across all Kubernetes distributions, major cloud platforms, on-premises data centers, and air-gapped environments. ScaleOps emphasized that deployment does not require code changes, infrastructure rewrites, or modifications to existing manifests. Shafrir said the platform “integrates seamlessly into existing model deployment pipelines without requiring any code or infrastructure changes,” and he added that teams can begin optimizing immediately with their existing GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment tooling.Shafrir also addressed how the automation interacts with existing systems. He said the platform operates without disrupting workflows or creating conflicts with custom scheduling or scaling logic, explaining that the system “doesn’t change manifests or deployment logic” and instead enhances schedulers, autoscalers, and custom policies by incorporating real-time operational context while respecting existing configuration boundaries.Performance, Visibility, and User ControlThe platform provides full visibility into GPU utilization, model behavior, performance metrics, and scaling decisions at multiple levels, including pods, workloads, nodes, and clusters. While the system applies default workload scaling policies, ScaleOps noted that engineering teams retain the ability to tune these policies as needed.In practice, the company aims to reduce or eliminate the manual tuning that DevOps and AIOps teams typically perform to manage AI workloads. Installation is intended to require minimal effort, described by ScaleOps as a two-minute process using a single helm flag, after which optimization can be enabled through a single action.Cost Savings and Enterprise Case StudiesScaleOps reported that early deployments of the AI Infra Product have achieved GPU cost reductions of 50–70% in customer environments. The company cited two examples:A major creative software company operating thousands of GPUs averaged 20% utilization before adopting ScaleOps.

          "content": "ScaleOps has expanded its cloud resource management platform with a new product aimed at enterprises operating self-hosted large language models (LLMs) and GPU-based AI applications. The AI Infra Product announced today, extends the company’s existing automation capabilities to address a growing need for efficient GPU utilization, predictable performance, and reduced operational burden in large-scale AI deployments. The company said the system is already running in enterprise production environments and delivering major efficiency gains for early adopters, reducing GPU costs by between 50% and 70%, according to the company. The company does not publicly list enterprise pricing for this solution and instead invites interested customers to receive a custom quote based on their operation size and needs here.In explaining how the system behaves under heavy load, Yodar Shafrir, CEO and Co-Founder of ScaleOps, said in an email to VentureBeat that the platform uses “proactive and reactive mechanisms to handle sudden spikes without performance impact,” noting that its workload rightsizing policies “automatically manage capacity to keep resources available.” He added that minimizing GPU cold-start delays was a priority, emphasizing that the system “ensures instant response when traffic surges,” particularly for AI workloads where model load times are substantial.Expanding Resource Automation to AI InfrastructureEnterprises deploying self-hosted AI models face performance variability, long load times, and persistent underutilization of GPU resources. ScaleOps positioned the new AI Infra Product as a direct response to these issues. The platform allocates and scales GPU resources in real time and adapts to changes in traffic demand without requiring alterations to existing model deployment pipelines or application code.According to ScaleOps, the system manages production environments for organizations including Wiz, DocuSign, Rubrik, Coupa, Alkami, Vantor, Grubhub, Island, Chewy, and several Fortune 500 companies. The AI Infra Product introduces workload-aware scaling policies that proactively and reactively adjust capacity to maintain performance during demand spikes. The company stated that these policies reduce the cold-start delays associated with loading large AI models, which improves responsiveness when traffic increases.Technical Integration and Platform CompatibilityThe product is designed for compatibility with common enterprise infrastructure patterns. It works across all Kubernetes distributions, major cloud platforms, on-premises data centers, and air-gapped environments. ScaleOps emphasized that deployment does not require code changes, infrastructure rewrites, or modifications to existing manifests. Shafrir said the platform “integrates seamlessly into existing model deployment pipelines without requiring any code or infrastructure changes,” and he added that teams can begin optimizing immediately with their existing GitOps, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment tooling.Shafrir also addressed how the automation interacts with existing systems. He said the platform operates without disrupting workflows or creating conflicts with custom scheduling or scaling logic, explaining that the system “doesn’t change manifests or deployment logic” and instead enhances schedulers, autoscalers, and custom policies by incorporating real-time operational context while respecting existing configuration boundaries.Performance, Visibility, and User ControlThe platform provides full visibility into GPU utilization, model behavior, performance metrics, and scaling decisions at multiple levels, including pods, workloads, nodes, and clusters. While the system applies default workload scaling policies, ScaleOps noted that engineering teams retain the ability to tune these policies as needed.In practice, the company aims to reduce or eliminate the manual tuning that DevOps and AIOps teams typically perform to manage AI workloads. Installation is intended to require minimal effort, described by ScaleOps as a two-minute process using a single helm flag, after which optimization can be enabled through a single action.Cost Savings and Enterprise Case StudiesScaleOps reported that early deployments of the AI Infra Product have achieved GPU cost reductions of 50–70% in customer environments. The company cited two examples:A major creative software company operating thousands of GPUs averaged 20% utilization before adopting ScaleOps. The product increased utilization, consolidated underused capacity, and enabled GPU nodes to scale down. These changes reduced overall GPU spending by more than half. The company also reported a 35% reduction in latency for key workloads.A global gaming company used the platform to optimize a dynamic LLM workload running on hundreds of GPUs.

According to an article published in ASM Case Reports on Thursday, the 57-year-old man went to a hospital in Dublin after his penis became red, swollen, and painful over the course of a week. He also had a fever. Doctors promptly admitted him to the hospital and noted that he had received a kidney transplant 15 years prior. As such, he was on immunosuppressive drugs, which keep his body from rejecting the organ, but could also allow infections to run amok. Initial blood work found hints of an infection, and the doctors initially suspected a bacterial skin infection (cellulitis) had taken hold in his nether region. So, they put him on some standard antibiotics for that. But his penis only got worse, redder, and more swollen. This prompted consultation with infectious disease doctors.Read full article Comments",

But all of these efforts are focused on the proteins and amino acids that build them. But biology doesn’t generate new proteins at that level. Instead, changes have to take place at the nucleic acid level before eventually making their presence felt at the protein level. And the DNA level is fairly removed from proteins, with lots of critical non-coding sequences, redundancy, and a fair degree of flexibility. It’s not necessarily obvious that learning the organization of a genome would help an AI system figure out how to make functional proteins.

Two US citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), all of whom live in the US, were charged in an indictment unsealed on Wednesday in US District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The indictment alleges a scheme to send Nvidia “GPUs to China by falsifying paperwork, creating fake contracts, and misleading US authorities,” John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said in a press release yesterday. The four arrestees are Hon Ning Ho (aka Mathew Ho), a US citizen who was born in Hong Kong and lives in Tampa, Florida; Brian Curtis Raymond, a US citizen who lives in Huntsville, Alabama; Cham Li (aka Tony Li), a PRC national who lives in San Leandro, California; and Jing Chen (aka Harry Chen), a PRC national who lives in Tampa on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa.Read full article Comments",

LAS VEGAS—A Formula 1 car runs on soon-to-be-synthetic gasoline, but an F1 team runs on data. It’s always been an engineering-driven sport, and while you can make decisions based on a hunch, the kinds of people who become good engineers prefer something a little more convincing. And the volumes of data just continue to get bigger and bigger each season. A few years ago, we spoke to Red Bull Racing about how it stayed on top of the task, but a lot has changed in F1 since 2017, as we found out at this year’s Las Vegas Grand Prix. It’s hugely popular now, for one thing, even in the United States: a 200 mph soap opera now with 24 episodes a season. Superficially, the cars look the same—exposed wheels, front and rear wings, the driver in between some side pods. And the hybrid powertrains that make the cars move are still the same format: 1.6 L turbocharged V6 engines that recover energy from the rear wheels under braking as well as the turbine as it gets spun by hot exhaust gases. But the cars are actually fundamentally different, particularly the way they generate their aerodynamic grip mostly via ground effect generated by the specially sculpted underside of their floors rather than the front and rear wings. A bigger change lurks in everyone’s accounts. The days when teams were free to spend as much money as they could find are gone.Read full article Comments",

The semiconductor tariffs are key to Donald Trump’s economic agenda, which is intended to force more manufacturing into the US by making it more expensive to import materials and products. He campaigned on axing the CHIPS Act—which provided subsidies to companies investing in manufacturing chips in the US—complaining that it was a “horrible, horrible thing” to “give hundreds of billions of dollars” away when the US could achieve the same objective by instead taxing companies and “use whatever is left over” of CHIPS funding to “reduce debt.” However, as 2025 winds down, the US president faces pressure on all sides to delay semiconductor tariffs, insiders told Reuters, and it appears that he is considering caving. According to “two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations,” US officials have privately told industry and government stakeholders that semiconductor tariffs will likely be delayed.Read full article Comments",

Northrop’s Pegasus rocket wins a rare contract. A startup named Katalyst Space Technologies won a $30 million contract from NASA in August to build a robotic rescue mission for the agency’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in low-Earth orbit. Swift, in space since 2004, is a unique instrument designed to study gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful explosions in the Universe. The spacecraft lacks a propulsion system and its orbit is subject to atmospheric drag, and NASA says it is “racing against the clock” to boost Swift’s orbit and extend its lifetime before it falls back to Earth. On Wednesday, Katalyst announced it selected Northrop Grumman’s air-launched Pegasus XL rocket to send the rescue craft into orbit next year.Read full article Comments",

Radivojevic and Lawrence stand on the site of Semiyarka. Credit: Peter J. Brown Welcome to the City of Seven Ravines University College of London archaeologist Miljana Radivojevic and her colleagues recently mapped the site with drones and geophysical surveys (like ground-penetrating radar, for example), tracing the layout of a 140-hectare city on the steppe in what’s now Kazakhstan. The Bronze Age city once boasted rows of houses built on earthworks, a large central building, and a neighborhood of workshops where artisans smelted and cast bronze. From its windswept promontory, it held a commanding view of a narrow point in the Irtysh River valley, a strategic location that may have offered the city “control over movement along the river and valley bottom,” according to Radivojevic and her colleagues. That view inspired archaeologists’ name for the city: Semiyarka, or City of Seven Ravines.Read full article Comments",

To his right, at Launch Complex 13 next door, a recently returned Falcon 9 booster stood on a landing pad. SpaceX has landed more than 500 large orbital rockets. And next to SpaceX sprawled the launch site operated by Blue Origin. Its massive New Glenn rocket is also reusable, and founder Jeff Bezos has invested tens of billions of dollars into the venture. Looking to the left, Lapsa saw a graveyard of sorts for commercial startups. Launch Complex 15 was leased to a promising startup, ABL Space, two years ago. After two failed launches, ABL Space pivoted away from commercial launch. Just beyond lies Launch Complex 16, where Relativity Space aims to launch from.

Nobody is immune, as A-list actor Chris Hemsworth discovered when his own father was recently diagnosed. The revelation inspired Hemsworth to embark on a trip down memory lane with his father, which took them to Australia’s Northern Territory. The experience was captured on film for A Road Trip to Remember, a new documentary film from National Geographic. Director Tom Barbor-Might had worked with Hemsworth on the latter’s documentary series Limitless, also for National Geographic. Each episode of Limitless follows Hemsworth on a unique challenge to push himself to the limits, augmented with interviews with scientific experts on such practices as fasting, extreme temperatures, brain-boosting, and regulating one’s stress response. Barbor-Might directed the season 1 finale, “Acceptance,” which was very different in tone, dealing with the inevitability of death and the need to confront one’s own mortality. “It was really interesting to see Chris in that more intimate personal space, and he was great at it,” Barbor-Might told Ars. “He was charming, emotional, and vulnerable, and it was really moving. It felt like there was more work to be done there.” When Craig Hemsworth received his Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore that personal element further.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Astronomical events such as eclipses were central to Maya culture, reflected in the care the Maya took to keep accurate calendars to aid in celestial predictions. Among the few surviving Maya texts is the so-called Dresden Codex, which includes a table of eclipses. Researchers have concluded that this table was repurposed from earlier lunar month tables, rather than being created solely for eclipse prediction, according to a paper published in the journal Science Advances. They also figured out the mechanism by which the Maya ensured that table would be accurate over a very long time period. The Maya used three primary calendars: a count of days, known as the Long Count; a 260-day astrological calendar called the Tzolk’in; and a 365-day year called the Haab’. Previous scholars have speculated on how awe-inspiring solar or lunar eclipses must have seemed to the Maya, but our understanding of their astronomical knowledge is limited. Most Maya books were burned by Spanish conquistadors and Catholic priests. Only four hieroglyphic codices survive: the Dresden Codex, the Madrid Codex, the Paris Codex, and the Grolier Codex. The Dresden Codex dates back to the 11th or 12th century and likely originated near Chichen Itza. It can be folded accordion-style and is 12 feet long in its unfolded state. The text was deciphered in the early 20th century and describes local history as well as astronomical lunar and Venus tables.Read full article Comments",
