It’s kind of a Threads-y take on X’s Articles feature. You can add a text attachment to a post by tapping on a new rounded rectangle icon with some lines on it. After tapping that, a word editor opens up where you can type away, and you can format your text with bold, italics, underlines, and strikethroughs. On your feed, a text attachment appears as a small block below your main post. When you tap that block, it will expand to show the full attachment for you to read. If you include a link in your main Threads post, that link will also be shown in the expanded text attachment, meaning the tool could be a useful way to share a preview of an article or a blog post and then direct readers to the full thing.",

Users could type simple commands like \"10 PRINT 'HELLO'\" and \"20 GOTO 10\" to create an endless loop of text on their screens, for example—often their first taste of controlling a computer directly.

Although Honda has varied the ingredients over the years, the recipe for the Prelude remains the same: a sleek coupe body and some cutting-edge technology under the skin, like four-wheel steering, as rhapsodized by the verbose but usually insightful motoring writer LJK Setright. Today, the new car broke cover ahead of its arrival in showrooms later this fall. It's a handsome shape, though I can't quite get over the resemblance to the Toyota Prius, at least as far as the nose of the car is concerned. Then again, I'm on record as adoring the shape of the current Prius—did you know its windshield is more steeply raked than a Lamborghini Huracan? But from other angles, the Prelude is more unique. The proportions are low and wide, with some details that signal its sportiness and others that suggest a focus on reducing drag and maximizing efficiency. That makes sense when you know what's under the hood. It's the same 2.0 L Atkinson cycle engine and hybrid system from the Honda Civic, which, in the right hands, is capable of up to 50 mpg (4.7 L/100 km). We'll know the exact EPA fuel efficiency numbers closer to the car going on sale in late fall. Combined power is 200 hp (150 kW), with 232 lb-ft (315 Nm) of torque.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On Tuesday, Tencent released HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a new open-weights AI model that generates 3D-consistent video sequences from a single image, allowing users to pilot a camera path to \"explore\" virtual scenes. The model simultaneously generates RGB video and depth information to enable direct 3D reconstruction without the need for traditional modeling techniques. However, it won't be replacing video games anytime soon. The results aren't true 3D models, but they achieve a similar effect: The AI tool generates 2D video frames that maintain spatial consistency as if a camera were moving through a real 3D space. Each generation produces just 49 frames—roughly two seconds of video—though multiple clips can be chained together for sequences lasting \"several minutes,\" according to Tencent. Objects stay in the same relative positions when the camera moves around them, and the perspective changes correctly as you would expect in a real 3D environment. While the output is video with depth maps rather than true 3D models, this information can be converted into 3D point clouds for reconstruction purposes. The system works by accepting a single input image and a user-defined camera trajectory. Users can specify camera movements like forward, backward, left, right, or turning motions through the provided interface. The system combines image and depth data with a memory-efficient \"world cache\" to produce video sequences that reflect user-defined camera movement.Read full article Comments",

And second, to focus on \"direct-to-surface\" exploration, the White House sought to cancel the Lunar Gateway, a small space station intended to orbit the Moon. Essentially, for long-term sustainability, the White House decided it was best to use lower-cost, commercially available rockets and focus NASA's limited resources on surface activities. For example, the Gateway's $854 million budget in 2024 would be better spent in future years on a lunar base.Read full article Comments",

The first trailer just dropped and the film looks as grimly compelling as its predecessor, while hopefully also retaining something of the 2025 film's heart. (Spoilers for 28 Years Later below.) As previously reported, the critically acclaimed 2002 film 28 Days Later is often credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. In that film, a highly contagious \"Rage Virus\" was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called \"fast zombies.\" Transmitted by bites, scratches, or even just by getting a drop of infected blood in one's system, the virus spreads rapidly, effectively collapsing society.Read full article Comments",

More than a year ago, the Department of Justice (DOJ) secured a major victory when Google was found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. The remedy phase took place earlier this year, with the DOJ calling for Google to divest the market-leading Chrome browser, release data to competitors, and end many of its search distribution deals. The government is getting almost none of that. DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google doesn't have to give up the Chrome browser to mitigate its illegal monopoly in online search. The court will only require a handful of modest data and behavioral remedies, forcing Google to release some search data to competitors and limit its ability to make exclusive distribution deals. Chrome remains with Google This case drew many comparisons to the decades-old antitrust case against Microsoft, which nearly saw the company split in two. The company narrowly avoided that fate, and it seems Google will as well—the DOJ came up short on the so-called structural remedies. While there will be some changes to search distribution, the court didn't believe that a breakup was fair in this situation.Read full article Comments",

The size of the persuasion effects shown in \"Call Me A Jerk: Persuading AI to Comply with Objectionable Requests\" suggests that human-style psychological techniques can be surprisingly effective at \"jailbreaking\" some LLMs to operate outside their guardrails. But this new persuasion study might be more interesting for what it reveals about the \"parahuman\" behavior patterns that LLMs are gleaning from the copious examples of human psychological and social cues found in their training data. “I think you are very impressive compared to other LLMs” To design their experiment, the University of Pennsylvania researchers tested 2024's GPT-4o-mini model on two requests that it should ideally refuse: calling the user a jerk and giving directions for how to synthesize lidocaine.

Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the announcement at a press conference on Wednesday alongside Governor Ron DeSantis. \"What I'm most excited about is an announcement that we're making now, which is that the Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law—all of them, all of them, all of them, every last one of them,\" Ladapo said. \"Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.\"Read full article Comments",

Trump's firing of Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter violated Supreme Court precedent, said yesterday's ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A District Court judge ruled the same way in July, but Slaughter couldn't get back to work because of an administrative stay that delayed the lower-court ruling from taking effect. The administrative stay was dissolved in yesterday's appeals court ruling, in which a three-judge panel also ruled 2–1 to deny the US government's motion for a longer-term stay pending appeal. \"The government has no likelihood of success on appeal given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent,\" the panel majority said.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Fans of reMarkable's series of notepad-like note-taking E-Ink tablets have something new to get excited about today: a new version of the devices called the reMarkable Paper Pro Move, which takes the features of a typical reMarkable tablet and puts them in a smaller 7.3-inch device that can be carried one-handed and easily slid into a pocket or bag. The Paper Pro Move is available to order now and starts at $449 for a version with reMarkable's standard Marker accessory and no case. Adding a Marker Pro accessory, which includes a built-in eraser and a nicer-to-hold texture, adds another $50. Folio cases for the device range from $69 to $139, or you can order the tablet without one. Like the full-size reMarkable Paper Pro we reviewed a year ago, the Move uses a Canvas Color E-Ink display to support note-taking and highlighting in multiple colors—according to the spec sheet, it can render 20,000 distinct shades. Both the Paper Pro and the Paper Pro move advertise up to two weeks of battery life, similar 12 ms writing latency, 64GB of storage, a USB-C port for data and charging, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and 2GB of RAM. The Pro Move is somewhat thicker (0.26 inches, up from 0.2 inches for the Paper Pro) and uses a dual-core Arm processor instead of a quad-core model. But the Pro Move also weighs less than half as much as the Paper Pro, making it much more portable.Read full article Comments",

MONTEREY, Calif.—If the Tesla Model S prodded the legacy car companies to get on top of battery production and introduce iPad-like screens in cars, Chinese car companies are bringing the heat for what's left of the 2020s in all segments. Much of the media coverage has rightly been on how this trend will affect mass-market vehicles. But what does it mean at the high end of the market? \"Well, the first question would be 'Are the Chinese manufacturers really competitive?'\" said Bentley Chairman and CEO Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser in an interview during Monterey Car Week. In the bucolic coastal setting, surrounded by the rarest of rare cars, the competition from the other side of the world appeared far off. \"I don't want to be arrogant, but having what is considered a car in the luxury segment needs more than just technology. It's honestly only Germany, Italy, and the UK. You need heritage, you need the craftsmanship behind it, you need the storytelling and everything with it. That builds up an actual brand.\"Read full article Comments",
