          "standfirst": "Winter nights are the perfect time to cuddle up with a favorite show or something new you finally have the time to dig in to. Cyber Monday sales are a great opportunity to try a new streaming service, and you'll find several premium services, like Starz, available for a discount. You can get an annual Starz subscription for a $58 discount for Cyber Monday. That's about $1 a month for an entire year of Outlander, and all you have to be willing to do is pay the entire $12 upfront. If you're not sure about Starz, you can test the waters by paying $3 monthly, down from $11. However, this 73 percent discount is only available for your first three months and then goes back up to full price. Basically, if you're at all interested, it's only an extra $3 for an extra nine months if you pay annually. If Starz isn't for you, check out some of the other great streaming deals available for Cyber Monday. There's discounts like six months of Apple TV for only $36 or $96 off one year of a Disney+ and Hulu bundle. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

          "standfirst": "Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday is one of the best times of the year to buy a new TV. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Cyber Monday TV deals we could find. The discounts still include well-reviewed OLED TVs and budget sets alike from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and Hisense. For those happy with their current TV, there are also several deals on media streamers and streaming services we like. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($890) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($770 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal is within $20 of the all-time low we saw on Black Friday. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Samsung The Frame TV (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $700 at Amazon ($198 off): You shouldn’t buy a Samsung’s Frame TV if you want the best picture quality for your dollar: They lack local dimming and Dolby Vision HDR, and some cheaper alternatives lap them when it comes to brightness and contrast. Instead, you’d buy one if care about your TV’s aesthetic above all else, since they’re designed to look like a framed piece of wall art. This set also has a matte screen finish, so it holds up well against glare and direct reflections. This discount drops the 55-inch version to a new all-time low. Just note that we’re highlighting the 2024 model; this year’s edition is also on sale for $98 more, but its panel still isn’t great the price, so we recommend saving as much cash as possible if you’re dead-set on buying one of these things. Also at Best Buy for $750. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (55-inch) for $1,598 at Amazon ($199 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch model. The 65-inch set is down to its best price as well at $1,997. Also at B&H. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Best Buy. Best Cyber Monday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target. Best Cyber Monday streaming service deals Apple TV 6-month subscription for $36 at Apple ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for $36, which comes out to $6 per month for the discounted period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show or Pluribus for less. The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's holiday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 at Sling ($4 off): Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's 30-plus channels, including ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-tv-deals-include-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-190000974.html?src=rss",

The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's holiday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 at Sling ($4 off): Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's 30-plus channels, including ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-tv-deals-include-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-190000974.html?src=rss",

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console on Cyber Monday, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Cyber Monday sale was announced a few weeks ago, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Cyber Monday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

For Cyber Monday, you can get a four-pack of Apple's AirTags for $63 at both Amazon and Walmart. That's a record low price for one of the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhones, lowering an individual tracker's price in the bundle from $29 down to $16. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

          "standfirst": "Fans of Game of Thrones and HGTV, rejoice. You can get a year of HBO Max for just $36 for Cyber Monday, lowering the normal $132 per year price by $96. The deal covers the ad-support version of the streaming service, but still includes a mix of popular originals (like the upcoming A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms), Warner Bros. films and live sports. You can sign up now via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

          "standfirst": "Apple gear is great, but pricey. So take advantage of Cyber Monday deals to pay less than usual on iPads, AirPods, MacBooks, Apple Watches and more. Some devices are hitting the lowest prices we've seen yet on the latest models. That includes the base-model iPad for $274, the AirPods Pro 3 for $220 and the Apple Watch Series 11 for $339. After reviewing every major device out there, we named an Apple product the winner in our guides to tablets, smartwatches, smartphones and laptops. So not only will you be scoring a nice discount, you'll get a device you'll almost certainly be happy with. Here are the best Apple Cyber Monday deals we could find.Editor's note: December 1 is the last day to get up to $250 in gift cards with your purchase from Apple's website. Other discounts are still available at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo and other third-party retailers, which you'll find linked below. Apple Cyber Monday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Walmart: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $69 earlier in the sale. Also available at Amazon and Target. AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $140 ($39 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. These hit a low of $100 earlier in the sale, but have since gone up to $140. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. AirPods Max for $400 ($149 off) at Amazon: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. This $400 sale price matches the all-time low But appears all but the black color are sold out. You can get the same deal at Walmart in for the headphones in black or starlight. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Cyber Monday deal Apple Cyber Monday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 13-inch, 256GB) for $1,199 ($100 off) at Amazon: To get the most out of the excessive power of the M5 chip, you might want the biggest screen. Once you add in the keyboard and Pencil Pro, you’re looking at one pricey setup (and might be better off with a MacBook?). But if extreme portability and massive power is what you crave, you may as well save $100 with this Cyber Monday discount. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Apple Watches Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm, GPS + cellular) for $700 ($99 off) at Amazon: The newest feature for Apple’s priciest smartwatch is satellite connectivity. The Ultra 3 has a titanium case, a large 49mm screen size and comes standard with cellular and dual GPS connectivity. It also has features for adventuring, like an on-board siren, depth gauge and up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The $99 discount within a dollar of the all-time low. Apple Cyber Monday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,149 ($350 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Accessories Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $63 ($36 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too for $18 instead of $29. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. This deal is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.

          "content": "Apple gear is great, but pricey. So take advantage of Cyber Monday deals to pay less than usual on iPads, AirPods, MacBooks, Apple Watches and more. Some devices are hitting the lowest prices we've seen yet on the latest models. That includes the base-model iPad for $274, the AirPods Pro 3 for $220 and the Apple Watch Series 11 for $339. After reviewing every major device out there, we named an Apple product the winner in our guides to tablets, smartwatches, smartphones and laptops. So not only will you be scoring a nice discount, you'll get a device you'll almost certainly be happy with. Here are the best Apple Cyber Monday deals we could find.Editor's note: December 1 is the last day to get up to $250 in gift cards with your purchase from Apple's website. Other discounts are still available at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo and other third-party retailers, which you'll find linked below. Apple Cyber Monday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Walmart: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $69 earlier in the sale. Also available at Amazon and Target. AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $140 ($39 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. These hit a low of $100 earlier in the sale, but have since gone up to $140. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. AirPods Max for $400 ($149 off) at Amazon: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. This $400 sale price matches the all-time low But appears all but the black color are sold out. You can get the same deal at Walmart in for the headphones in black or starlight. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Cyber Monday deal Apple Cyber Monday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 13-inch, 256GB) for $1,199 ($100 off) at Amazon: To get the most out of the excessive power of the M5 chip, you might want the biggest screen. Once you add in the keyboard and Pencil Pro, you’re looking at one pricey setup (and might be better off with a MacBook?). But if extreme portability and massive power is what you crave, you may as well save $100 with this Cyber Monday discount. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Apple Watches Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm, GPS + cellular) for $700 ($99 off) at Amazon: The newest feature for Apple’s priciest smartwatch is satellite connectivity. The Ultra 3 has a titanium case, a large 49mm screen size and comes standard with cellular and dual GPS connectivity. It also has features for adventuring, like an on-board siren, depth gauge and up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The $99 discount within a dollar of the all-time low. Apple Cyber Monday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,149 ($350 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Accessories Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $63 ($36 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is here for anyone who didn't get a chance to get everything on their list (or were too tired from Thanksgiving to shop). In good news for anyone who loves Anker gear, every deal we found for Black Friday is still going strong. We think Anker makes some of the most reliable charging gear out there, which is why it keeps winning out in our tests and ending up in our guides to MagSafe power banks, wireless charging stations, iPhone accessories and more. So forget all that stuff about early birds, there are plenty of worms for the later birds, too. Here are the best Cyber Monday Anker deals we could find. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker's Laptop Power Bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features is going for nearly $50 of right now. If could recommend one purchase to our readers, this would be it. We think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. It's got a higher capacity and wattage rating and it looks just as sleek. Plus, in my humble opinion, $38 is a way better deal than $99. Anker also makes our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2). Thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity, it's one of the best ways to recharge an iPhone on the go.. I love this shiny little brick. The 3-in-1 portable charger has a built-in cable that's also a strap, plus wall prongs and a handy display. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Cyber Monday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Cyber Monday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Cyber Monday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Cyber Monday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands aside from just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Cyber Monday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Cyber Monday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "Apple's entry-level iPad A16 is the perfect couch computer, and you can get one on sale for $274 for Cyber Monday. The model comes in a variety of colors and is the most affordable option in the company's lineup at its normal $349 price, and even more so now for 21 percent off. The 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $274, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Cyber Monday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

          "standfirst": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. On this list, I've gathered the top subscriptions of all sorts you can enjoy this Cyber Monday, from streaming savings on your favorite shows to VPNs that keep you anonymous online to MasterClass deals that continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Cyber Monday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Cyber Monday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Cyber Monday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library, including Outlander and Spartacus, with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Cyber Monday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (six months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Six months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Cyber Monday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $68.40 (81 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. hide.me VPN (26 months) for $99.95 (61 percent off): hide.me is currently our favorite free VPN, but its paid upgrade is just as competitive. The best thing about this deal is that you're guaranteed to get renewed at the same price and duration, which isn't always certain, even with otherwise reliable VPNs. hide.me gives you servers in 91 locations, all of them rated for up to a gigabyte of traffic per second. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-are-here-big-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-disney-proton-vpn-and-more-174507016.html?src=rss",
          "content": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. On this list, I've gathered the top subscriptions of all sorts you can enjoy this Cyber Monday, from streaming savings on your favorite shows to VPNs that keep you anonymous online to MasterClass deals that continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Cyber Monday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away.

Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite.

We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Cyber Monday sales remain a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Cyber Monday gaming deals we could find below. So far we’re seeing PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards, headsets and other peripherals we like. Cyber Monday game console deals Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off MSRP): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $499 at Amazon: Yes, we know this isn’t an actual deal, but we note it just to say that we aren’t seeing any discounts on Nintendo’s latest hybrid console as of this writing. This SKU with the newest Mario Kart remains the best “value” if you’re looking to grab the device for the holidays, as you’d have to pay an extra $30 if you bought the console and game separately. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 (256GB) for $39 at Amazon ($20 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (and pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. For Cyber Monday, that’s Samsung’s officially licensed card, provided you can live with 256GB of space. This discount marks a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off MSRP): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Cyber Monday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $160 at Amazon ($41 off): This ties the best price to date for Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller, which adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others for $170. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Amazon ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Best Buy and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Final Fantasy XVI for $15 at Amazon ($35 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than most other games in the series. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is the best price to date for the PS5 copy. Also at Walmart, or at Xbox and Steam for $25. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Rangarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton more first-party PS5 games for Black Friday and Cyber Monday beyond that. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Cyber Monday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $185 at Amazon ($75 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card represents an all-time low. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its best-ever price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Cyber Monday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Battlefield 6 for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): This latest entry is generally seen as a return to form for the long-running military FPS series — at least when it comes to its chaotic multiplayer suite. If you’ve been meaning to step outside of the Call of Duty bubble, this is a new all-time low. Split Fiction for $30 at Walmart ($20 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. This is the best price we’ve seen for the PS5 copy. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for $40. Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater for $35 at Amazon ($35 off): Metal Gear Solid 3 is on the shortlist of the PS2’s greatest games. Delta is full-scale remake that preserves the original’s core while drastically overhauling its visuals and modernizing its controls. We saw it fall as low as $30 at Amazon and Walmart last week, but this is still a nice drop. Also available at GameStop, or for $49 at PlayStation and Xbox if you can only get a digital copy. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for $40 at Amazon ($30 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw last week, but it's still a decent drop. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at Xbox ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the Xbox edition. Also at Steam. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox and PS4 versions. Also at Amazon for the latter. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming handheld deals Steam Deck (256GB, LCD) for $319 at Steam ($80 off): It’s nearly four years old, but the entry-level Steam Deck remains a stellar value for playing PC games on the go. It doesn’t sound like a true successor is coming anytime soon, either. This 20 percent discount ties the best price we’ve seen. Just be aware that the Deck can struggle with some newer AAA games, while SteamOS continues to have compatibility issues with games like Apex Legends or Destiny 2 that use kernel-level anti-cheat systems. Unfortunately, the higher-end Steam Deck OLED models aren’t discounted as of this writing. Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $209 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Cyber Monday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $35. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Amazon ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. This is another all-time low. You need to be a Prime member to access this deal at Amazon, but the mini and large versions are available directly from Pulsar for the same price. Cyber Monday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-gaming-deals-for-2025-save-on-ps5-consoles-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-xbox-controllers-tons-of-games-and-more-172904246.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Cyber Monday sales remain a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Cyber Monday gaming deals we could find below. So far we’re seeing PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards, headsets and other peripherals we like. Cyber Monday game console deals Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off MSRP): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $499 at Amazon: Yes, we know this isn’t an actual deal, but we note it just to say that we aren’t seeing any discounts on Nintendo’s latest hybrid console as of this writing. This SKU with the newest Mario Kart remains the best “value” if you’re looking to grab the device for the holidays, as you’d have to pay an extra $30 if you bought the console and game separately. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 (256GB) for $39 at Amazon ($20 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (and pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. For Cyber Monday, that’s Samsung’s officially licensed card, provided you can live with 256GB of space. This discount marks a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off MSRP): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Cyber Monday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $160 at Amazon ($41 off): This ties the best price to date for Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller, which adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others for $170. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Amazon ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Best Buy and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Final Fantasy XVI for $15 at Amazon ($35 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than most other games in the series. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is the best price to date for the PS5 copy. Also at Walmart, or at Xbox and Steam for $25. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Rangarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton more first-party PS5 games for Black Friday and Cyber Monday beyond that. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Cyber Monday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $185 at Amazon ($75 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card represents an all-time low. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its best-ever price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Cyber Monday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Battlefield 6 for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): This latest entry is generally seen as a return to form for the long-running military FPS series — at least when it comes to its chaotic multiplayer suite. If you’ve been meaning to step outside of the Call of Duty bubble, this is a new all-time low. Split Fiction for $30 at Walmart ($20 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. This is the best price we’ve seen for the PS5 copy. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for $40. Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater for $35 at Amazon ($35 off): Metal Gear Solid 3 is on the shortlist of the PS2’s greatest games. Delta is full-scale remake that preserves the original’s core while drastically overhauling its visuals and modernizing its controls. We saw it fall as low as $30 at Amazon and Walmart last week, but this is still a nice drop. Also available at GameStop, or for $49 at PlayStation and Xbox if you can only get a digital copy. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for $40 at Amazon ($30 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw last week, but it's still a decent drop. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at Xbox ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the Xbox edition. Also at Steam. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox and PS4 versions. Also at Amazon for the latter. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming handheld deals Steam Deck (256GB, LCD) for $319 at Steam ($80 off): It’s nearly four years old, but the entry-level Steam Deck remains a stellar value for playing PC games on the go. It doesn’t sound like a true successor is coming anytime soon, either. This 20 percent discount ties the best price we’ve seen. Just be aware that the Deck can struggle with some newer AAA games, while SteamOS continues to have compatibility issues with games like Apex Legends or Destiny 2 that use kernel-level anti-cheat systems. Unfortunately, the higher-end Steam Deck OLED models aren’t discounted as of this writing. Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $209 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Cyber Monday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $35. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Amazon ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. This is another all-time low. You need to be a Prime member to access this deal at Amazon, but the mini and large versions are available directly from Pulsar for the same price. Cyber Monday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-gaming-deals-for-2025-save-on-ps5-consoles-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-xbox-controllers-tons-of-games-and-more-172904246.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Streaming deals come and go throughout the year, but they are most abundant around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s been a testy year for streaming services to say the least, and one big manifestation of that has been continuously rising prices. Disney+ and HBO Max were just a couple of the streaming services that bumped up prices, which means it’s more important than ever to subscribe if and when you can get a discount. Thankfully, a ton of streaming services are on sale for Cyber Monday. These are the best Cyber Monday streaming deals you can get this year; just note, though, that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Also, most of the end at the end of the day on Cyber Monday, so you only have a bit more time to decide if you want to take the plunge. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well. If you're looking for a more affordable plan, the News + Sports tier has a $10 discount for new subscribers. DirecTV — starting at $50/month for one month: All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-cyber-monday-streaming-deals-for-2025-disney-hulu-bundle-is-only-60-for-one-year-plus-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-and-others-172013103.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Just in time for Cyber Monday, Disney is offering the Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle for just $5 a month for one year. That means you can pay $60, less than the price of taking your family to the movies, and get a year's worth of entertainment. The deal is available to both new and returning subscribers, and include access to all of the biggest hits in Disney's catalog, whether its Star Wars or Only Murders in the Building. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period.

But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday 2025 has arrived, and if you haven’t started your holiday shopping yet, now’s the time. Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have been basically in full-swing since early November, and now most of those have become the best Cyber Monday you can get. This is the time of year to look for not just gifts for the holidays, but also for things you need for yourself, be it household essentials, shoes, and yes, new tech.Engadget can help with that last category. We’ve been tracking the best Cyber Monday deals on tech since the start of the month, and we’ve collected the best of the bunch here that are still available for Cyber Monday. As to be expected, most things are down to record-low prices, and you’ll find some of the best discounts on things like headphones, streaming devices, robot vacuums, tech accessories and more. These are the best Cyber Monday deals on tech for 2025. Cyber Monday deals: Engadget's top picks Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $274 (21 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. PlayStation 5 standard edition for $449 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles, particularly the digital edition, go in and out of stock as of late. However, it has come back eventually at retailers like Amazon. If you see the model you want listed as out of stock, it's worth it to check back in an hour or two to see if that's changed. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Cyber Monday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $66 (45 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off): Sonos' most premium soundbar offers crisp, clear sound and an impressive bass boost over the original. It has a sleek design and works with the Sonos Ace headphones as well. There are plenty of other Sonos Cyber Monday deals to consider as well, both on Amazon and direct at Sonos. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Cyber Monday streaming deals and subscription deals Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Cyber Monday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 ($50 off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Cyber Monday deals under $50 LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Cyber Monday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Cyber Monday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Cyber Monday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-on-tech-for-2025-the-best-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-dyson-disney-and-others-are-up-to-50-percent-off-170028712.html?src=rss",

UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Cyber Monday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Cyber Monday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-on-tech-for-2025-the-best-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-dyson-disney-and-others-are-up-to-50-percent-off-170028712.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off all models. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, this is the deal to beat. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles go in and out of stock at this point, but if you check back at your preferred retailer, most of them have come back in stock within a few hours. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Cyber Monday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Cyber Monday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Cyber Monday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179. You'll find a ton of PlayStation Cyber Monday deals across the web right now, and they also include some game sales.

          "standfirst": "If you're focusing on self-improvement heading into the new year, MasterClass is running a limited-time offer for Cyber Monday that halves the price of its annual subscriptions. You get access to hundreds of lessons taught by well-known celebrities and experts in their fields, and all for 50 percent off the normal $120 to $240 you'd pay for a MasterClass premium plan. MasterClass has built a reputation as one of the best streaming platforms for learning new skills and creative hobbies. The service features courses led by industry leaders who share practical insights drawn from their own careers. Whether you want to cook with Gordon Ramsay, explore storytelling with Neil Gaiman or study filmmaking with Martin Scorsese, the range of topics is broad enough to appeal to almost any interest. Classes are organized into short, easy-to-follow video lessons, making it simple to fit learning into a busy schedule. Each one comes with supplemental materials like downloadable workbooks, assignments or behind-the-scenes notes that add extra depth. New classes are added regularly, so subscribers have a steady flow of fresh content throughout the year. Subscriptions are structured around annual plans that unlock the full catalog. You can watch classes on most devices, including smartphones, tablets and smart TVs, and your progress syncs across platforms. Offline viewing is supported too, so you can download lessons to study during travel or commutes. Beyond creative skills, MasterClass has expanded into professional growth and wellness topics, with courses covering leadership, communication and mindfulness. It’s not just about inspiration; the platform’s focus on actionable advice makes it a practical choice for anyone who wants to pick up new skills or refresh existing ones. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. If you’ve been thinking about joining or gifting a membership, this promotion is one of the best times to do it. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

That lowers the streaming subscription down to $6 a month, which is only a $1 away from what Apple TV+ when it originally launched in 2019. The deal is available to new and eligible returning subscribers through December 1, so if you're looking for new shows to watch, now's the time to subscribe. Apple TV+ continues to have one of the strongest and most varied lineups in streaming. Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience. All content is ad-free and available in up to 4K HDR, with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support where available. The app works on nearly every device, from iPhone and iPad to smart TVs, PlayStation, Xbox and Roku. You can also download episodes and movies to watch offline, which is handy for travel or long commutes. If you’re already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the integration is seamless. You can share your subscription with up to five other people through Family Sharing, and playback syncs across devices so you can start a show on your iPhone and finish it on your TV. Apple TV+ is also part of the Apple One bundle if you prefer to manage multiple Apple services under a single plan. This deal is available to new and qualified returning subscribers, meaning those who haven’t had an active subscription in the past 30 days. You’ll need to sign up directly through Apple rather than a third-party service or carrier. Once the three-month period ends, the plan renews at the standard $13 per month, so be sure to cancel before the renewal date if you don’t want to continue. With a growing slate of original series, award-winning films and a slick interface, Apple TV+ has turned into one of the best streaming services for premium content. And with this limited-time deal, you can catch up on its biggest hits without paying full price. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well.

Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads.

          "standfirst": "The previous generation of Sony's wireless headphones, the excellent WH-1000XM5, are available for as low as $248 for Cyber Monday. That's nearly equal to the record low the headphones hit on Prime Day, and $152 off their normal $400 price. Sony's flagship noise-canceling headphones are now the WH-1000XM6, but if you're on a budget, you'll still get a fantastic audio experience from the older model, especially at this heavily discounted price. We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 review, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t entirely baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are. Naturally, the WH-1000XM6 that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they're on sale now for $398 for Cyber Monday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you're willing to spend a bit more. However, we still think the XM5 deal is the best value for most people here.

          "title": "Apple's Cyber Monday sale includes the MacBook Air M4 for $250 off",
          "standfirst": "Apple's MacBook Air M4 has dipped below its $999 starting price before, but the lightweight laptop is on sale for $749, the lowest price this model has been since it launched and one of the all-round best computer deals you'll find during Cyber Monday. The model on sale is available in four different colors and includes 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, more than enough for most people. If you are interested in more storage, though, Apple's 512GB model is also on sale for $949, another record low versus its $1,199 Apple Store price. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

          "title": "Best Black Friday streaming deals for 2025: Disney+ Hulu bundle is only $60 for one year, plus major savings on Apple TV+, HBO Max and others",
          "standfirst": "Streaming deals come and go throughout the year, but they are most abundant around Black Friday. It’s been a testy year for streaming services to say the least, and one big manifestation of that has been continuously rising prices. Disney+ and HBO Max were just a couple of the streaming services that bumped up prices, which means it’s more important than ever to subscribe if and when you can get a discount. These are the best Black Friday streaming deals you can get this year; just note, though, that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well. If you're looking for a more affordable plan, the News + Sports tier has a $10 discount for new subscribers. DirecTV — starting at $50/month for one month: All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-black-friday-streaming-deals-for-2025-disney-hulu-bundle-is-only-60-for-one-year-plus-major-savings-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-and-others-094257749.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is officially on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1, giving new and returning subscribers a full year of both streaming platforms for less than the cost of a few movie tickets. The bundle includes Disney+ and Hulu’s basic plans with ads, so if you’ve been waiting for a sign to catch up on Only Murders in the Building or dive into the Star Wars universe, this is it. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place.

Considering how new the AirPods Pro 3 are, this might be the best deal you'll see on the earbuds for a good while. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort.

          "standfirst": "Holiday shopping can be tough because you may only have so much money to spend on gifts and things for yourself. Sticking to your budget might be more important to you this year than ever, and you’re looking for deals that can help you do that. Engadget can help with that, at least in the electronics department. Yes, there are plenty of great deals on big-ticket items this year like game consoles and robot vacuums, but it would be a mistake to think you can snag an excellent gadget for $100 or less. If that sounds like just what you’re looking for, you’ve come to the right place. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get for $100 or less. If you're interested in even more affordable tech, we've got a whole list of Black Friday deals under $50, too. Best Black Friday deals for $100 or less Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): Getting into the smart home space can seem daunting, but opting for a small but powerful device like the Amazon Smart Plug can make it much easier. It's one of our favorite smart plugs because it's almost entirely plug-and-play. It's super simple to set up and then you can control almost anything you plug into it with Alexa voice commands or mobile app. The only caveat is that it only supports Alexa voice control, making it the best option for those who already use Amazon's voice assistant often. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off): If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Amazon Kindle for $80 ($25 off): Amazon's entry-level Kindle is the best budget e-reader on the market right now, with a compact and durable design, plus a crisp display. If you already have a bunch of ebooks purchased through the Kindle Store, it's one of the best options for you, and Amazon's Whispersync feature lines up where you are in the e-printed version with the narration if you go back and forth between reading and listening to Audible audiobooks. Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $88 (35 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best power banks, this Anker brick is kind of a one-and-done device. It has enough capacity to charge all sorts of devices from smartphones to laptops to handheld gaming consoles, and it has two built-in USB-C cables so you don't even have to remember to bring your own to use it. Also available at Anker.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-for-100-or-less-are-still-on-sale-081912408.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "These days, Black Friday is the longest day of the year. We're only halfway through November, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library, including Outlander and Spartacus, with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (six months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Six months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $68.40 (81 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. hide.me VPN (26 months) for $99.95 (61 percent off): hide.me is currently our favorite free VPN, but its paid upgrade is just as competitive. The best thing about this deal is that you're guaranteed to get renewed at the same price and duration, which isn't always certain, even with otherwise reliable VPNs. hide.me gives you servers in 91 locations, all of them rated for up to a gigabyte of traffic per second. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-you-can-still-get-today-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-disney-proton-vpn-and-more-180000005.html?src=rss",
          "content": "These days, Black Friday is the longest day of the year. We're only halfway through November, but amazing deals are already popping up for some of our favorite subscription services. This is a great time to lock in a long-term deal on a streaming platform, but there's even more to explore beyond that, from a big discount on Quicken (which you can use to chart all the money you're saving) and one of the best offers I've ever seen for DeleteMe (which cleans your personal data off the internet while you kick back with your new Amazon Prime Video subscription). We'll update this list for the rest of the month as new deals go live. Best Black Friday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Black Friday. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Black Friday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have free access to Encanto and Moana 2 for the kids, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ has another of the best Black Friday streaming deals this year, offering a six months of access for only $36, which comes out to only $6 per month. The deal is live now for new and returning subscribers. Through December 1, you've got a great chance to stream shows like Severance, Ted Lasso, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less — just remember the deal only applies if you subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library, including Outlander and Spartacus, with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Fox One (six months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Six months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $68.40 (81 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. hide.me VPN (26 months) for $99.95 (61 percent off): hide.me is currently our favorite free VPN, but its paid upgrade is just as competitive. The best thing about this deal is that you're guaranteed to get renewed at the same price and duration, which isn't always certain, even with otherwise reliable VPNs. hide.me gives you servers in 91 locations, all of them rated for up to a gigabyte of traffic per second. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-you-can-still-get-today-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-disney-proton-vpn-and-more-180000005.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "There’s no denying Apple’s massive reputation in the tech world. And it appears it’s not just hype — our reviews put an Apple product at the top of our buying guides to tablets, smartwatches, smartphones and laptops. But Apple devices aren’t cheap. That’s why it’s a good idea to wait for Apple Black Friday deals. You won’t find pure discounts at Apple’s site, but retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more are happy to discount iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, and AirPods— and we’ve rounded up the best sales right here. Check out the best Black Friday Apple deals you can still get below. Editor's note: Apple's own website does not typically host sales. But now through December 1, you can get up to $250 in gift cards from that site. For pure discounts, however, you'll need to shop Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo or other third-party retailers, which you'll find linked below. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $69 ($61 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $80. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $110 ($69 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. These hit a low of $100 earlier in the sale, but have since gone up to $110. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods Max for $400 ($149 off) at Amazon: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. This $400 sale price matches the all-time low and it's good for most of the colorways, though a few hues are selling out. You can get the same deal at Walmart in for all but the orange model. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Black Friday deal Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Target and Best Buy. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $749 at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 13-inch, 256GB) for $1,199 ($100 off) at Amazon: To get the most out of the excessive power of the M5 chip, you might want the biggest screen. Once you add in the keyboard and Pencil Pro, you’re looking at one pricey setup (and might be better off with a MacBook?). But if extreme portability and massive power is what you crave, you may as well save $100 with this Black Friday discount. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watches Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm, GPS + cellular) for $700 ($99 off) at Amazon: The newest feature for Apple’s priciest smartwatch is satellite connectivity. The Ultra 3 has a titanium case, a large 49mm screen size and comes standard with cellular and dual GPS connectivity. It also has features for adventuring, like an on-board siren, depth gauge and up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The $99 discount within a dollar of the all-time low. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($207 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $63 ($36 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too for $18 instead of $29. Apple Pencil USB-C for $49 ($30 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. This deal is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.

The Ultra 3 has a titanium case, a large 49mm screen size and comes standard with cellular and dual GPS connectivity. It also has features for adventuring, like an on-board siren, depth gauge and up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The $99 discount within a dollar of the all-time low. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($207 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $63 ($36 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too for $18 instead of $29. Apple Pencil USB-C for $49 ($30 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. This deal is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.

          "standfirst": "If you've ever wanted to know what you're missing in your favorite songs and shows, now is the time to upgrade: Black Friday and Cyber Monday have some of the best speakers on the market down to their lowest prices of the year. We've dug up savings on everything from tiny portable speakers like the JBL Go 3 to behemoths like the UE Hyperboom, not to mention soundbars and smart speakers. Everything on the list is an investment you won't regret if you ever listen to anything digital — those who can afford to hire a string quartet for their kitchen can keep scrolling. Best Black Friday speaker deals under $50 Amazon Echo Pop for $22 (45 percent off): If you're excited about the more conversational and capable Alexa+ but have been holding off for budget reasons, breathe a sigh of relief. The latest Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest, cheapest smart speaker that still comes with Alexa+ early access. It may not fill a whole house, but it's great for listening to music or podcasts in a bedroom, office or small kitchen. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This is the absolute cheapest you'll probably see a full-size Bluetooth speaker go for in 2025 — the Soundcore 2, the latest effort by Anker to expand from charging components into portable audio. This model gets you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. Amazon Echo Dot 5th Gen for $32 (36 percent off): The fifth-generation Echo Dot is cheaper than ever, and it was already the best smart speaker under $50. Its genius spherical design lets it pack a lot of audio into a compact space, and it can be controlled with both hands-free Alexa commands and on-device buttons. The latest release comes with early access to the Alexa+ AI upgrade. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $50 (29 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 (38 percent off): The Echo Spot looks like an Echo Dot sawed in half, which is a surprisingly effective design. It's designed to work best as a bedside alarm clock, but you can customize the screen to show things other than time, including a weather forecast, smart home controls or the current song on your playlist. It's Alexa-capable, and like the latest Echo Dot, will let you give Alexa+ AI a try. Best Black Friday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Black Friday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Amazon Fire TV Soundbar for $85 (29 percent off): Amazon's soundbar supports Dolby surround sound, works straightforwardly through a single HDMI cable and can be upgraded with an optional Alexa voice assistant. It works with more than just Amazon products, too, being compatible with all smart TVs. It's even capable of pulling double duty as a bluetooth speaker. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Amazon Echo Dot Max for $90 (10 percent off): The Echo Dot Max just dropped this month, and our reaction was mixed, but there's no denying the leaps forward in this brand-new addition. Not only does it feature better sound than the vanilla Echo Dot, but Alexa+ makes is a much more equal conversation partner. The Echo Dot Max features a similar spherical design to the Dot, but with forward-facing physical buttons on the surface of the sphere. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Black Friday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 for $150 (25 percent off): The UE Megaboom line is venerable at this point, dropping first in 2015, but its fourth iteration still tops our audiophile lists. It puts out 360-degree sound with an emphasis on bass, can work up to 147 feet away from the music source, and literally floats in water (though you probably shouldn't leave it in the pool all night). It can even pair with any other UE speaker through PartyUp — combining it with a couple of Wonderbooms pays off in spades. Sonos Era 100 for $169 (15 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Marshall Acton III for $180 (40 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too). It's less portable at 6.3 pounds, but can hit high volumes with little or no distortion. The upgrade angled Acton III's tweeters outward so the soundscape is wider, making this one speaker very capable of filling a room with sound on its own. Sony ULT Field 5 for $195 (44 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $200 (26 percent off): We gave the Everboom a full review when it first dropped last year, and found it stuck to the general Ultimate Ears plan — nothing earth-shattering in the audio quality, but rugged reliability and fantastic extra features. Everboom users can connect it to the UE Boom app, which lets you control the volume remotely, use the speaker as a megaphone to make announcements, import your playlists and pair Everbooms through the PartyUp chaining feature. Best Black Friday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The SoundLink Max, Bose's biggest speaker that isn't a soundbar, is more affordable for Black Friday than we've seen for a while. Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music. Sonos Era 300 for $378 (21 percent off): The Era 300 is Sonos's big (and largely successful) swing at a truly space-filling smart speaker, combining spatial audio with support for both Alexa and its own assistant. The Trueplay feature detects the environment around the speaker and adjusts its setup to reach every corner. Spatial audio can be hit-or-miss on older tracks, but it's transcendent with modern ones. Sonos Move 2 for $399 (20 percent off): Move is Sonos's high-end portable smart speaker, with more heft, power and features than the smaller Roam line. With the Move 2, Sonos improved the Move's sound quality, boosted its battery life to well over 24 hours, jacked up the volume and redesigned the outer hardware for greater durability. It also works with both Alexa and the Sonos assistant, but it's more portable than the Era 300. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 8 for $798 (20 percent off): In our review of the Bravia 6 this year, we called out its full sound and special talent for enhancing dialogue, but were frustrated that it didn't support AirPlay or Spotify Connect. The Bravia 8 works with both services, making it a clear choice for your next premium soundbar. It's got a tight, low-footprint design that fits any aesthetic, and hits a maximum output power of 495 watts. Sonos Arc Ultra for $879 (20 percent off): The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best premium soundbar, bar none (pun intended). As we cover in our full review, it delivers full-throated bass without needing an extra sub, and has added more mid-range drivers and tweeters to make dialogue pop. Its software features are also solid, with Trueplay sound tuning, Speech Enhancement and a new Night Sound mode to tone down the boom for your roommates' sake. JBL Bar 1300XMK2 for $1,200 (29 percent off): If you're going to drop $1200 on a soundbar, you need to know it's going to deliver — and the 1300XMK2 does. Its key design element is two detachable speakers that recharge when plugged into the main unit, but can spend up to 10 hours unplugged. The audioscape does an excellent job of separating and clarifying details, which really enhances the sense of a theatrical experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-speaker-deals-for-2025-are-still-live-save-up-to-50-percent-on-bluetooth-speakers-smart-speakers-and-soundbars-091904782.html?src=rss",

Sonos Arc Ultra for $879 (20 percent off): The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best premium soundbar, bar none (pun intended). As we cover in our full review, it delivers full-throated bass without needing an extra sub, and has added more mid-range drivers and tweeters to make dialogue pop. Its software features are also solid, with Trueplay sound tuning, Speech Enhancement and a new Night Sound mode to tone down the boom for your roommates' sake. JBL Bar 1300XMK2 for $1,200 (29 percent off): If you're going to drop $1200 on a soundbar, you need to know it's going to deliver — and the 1300XMK2 does. Its key design element is two detachable speakers that recharge when plugged into the main unit, but can spend up to 10 hours unplugged. The audioscape does an excellent job of separating and clarifying details, which really enhances the sense of a theatrical experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-speaker-deals-for-2025-are-still-live-save-up-to-50-percent-on-bluetooth-speakers-smart-speakers-and-soundbars-091904782.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Black Friday sales look like a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Black Friday gaming deals we could find below. So far we’re seeing PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards, headsets and other peripherals we like. Black Friday game console deals Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off MSRP): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $499 at Amazon: Yes, we know this isn’t an actual deal, but we note it just to say that we aren’t seeing any discounts on Nintendo’s latest hybrid console as of this writing. This SKU with the newest Mario Kart remains the best “value” if you’re looking to grab the device for the holidays, as you’d have to pay an extra $30 if you bought the console and game separately. Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for $30 at Target ($30 off): Here’s a new low for this HD update to one of Nintendo’s more underappreciated 2D platformers. Originally released for the Wii back in 2010, DKC Returns is a true challenge that exudes character through its level design and Donkey Kong’s thudding movement. Great music, too. Also at Walmart, or at Best Buy and others for $40 if this offer expires. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $30 at Target ($20 off): Echoes of Wisdom makes a few bold changes to the series’ usual formula, mixing the freeform spirit of Tears of the Kingdom (which isn’t on sale) with the top-down view of earlier 2D Zelda games. This deal is a new low. Also for $40 at Amazon, Best Buy and others. Super Mario Odyssey for $30 at Amazon ($30 off): It’s pushing a decade old, but Odyssey remains a joyous 3D platformer with pitch-perfect controls and a relentless stream of inventive ideas. This deal comes within a dollar of the game’s all-time low. Also at Walmart, Best Buy, Target and others. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $30 at Best Buy ($30 off): Here’s a new low for the Switch remake of this beloved GameCube RPG. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar called it an “absolute treasure” in his review last year. Also at Target. Several other first-party Switch exclusives are down to $30 as well, including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Splatoon 3, Nintendo Switch Sports, Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe and Luigi’s Mansion 3. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): The Switch 2 requires new microSD Express cards to expand its storage, and this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s latest model. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a few weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you need more space for a Switch 2, this is the second-best price for Lexar’s most spacious microSD Express card since July and the cheapest 1TB model we can find right now. Best Black Friday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Black Friday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $160 at Amazon ($41 off): This ties the best price to date for Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller, which adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others for $170. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Amazon ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Best Buy and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Final Fantasy XVI for $15 at Amazon ($35 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than most other games in the series. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is the best price to date for the PS5 copy. Also at Walmart, or at Xbox and Steam for $25. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Rangarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton of other first-party PS5 games for Black Friday beyond this. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Black Friday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s Black Friday selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device’s recent street price. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Black Friday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Battlefield 6 for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): This latest entry is generally seen as a return to form for the long-running military FPS series — at least when it comes to its chaotic multiplayer suite. If you’ve been meaning to step outside of the Call of Duty bubble, this is a new all-time low. Split Fiction for $30 at Walmart ($20 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. This is the best price we’ve seen for the PS5 copy. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for $40. Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): Metal Gear Solid 3 is on the shortlist of the PS2’s greatest games. Delta is full-scale remake that preserves the original’s core while drastically overhauling its visuals and modernizing its controls. We saw it fall as low as $30 at Amazon and Walmart earlier this week, but this is still a nice drop. Also available for $49 at PlayStation and Xbox if you can only get a digital copy. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds + $10 digital credit for $40 at Amazon ($40 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw earlier this week, but it includes a $10 digital Amazon credit when you redeem the code SONIC10 on the product page or at checkout. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at Xbox ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the Xbox edition. Also at Steam. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox version. Also at Amazon. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Black Friday gaming handheld deals Steam Deck (256GB, LCD) for $319 at Steam ($80 off): It’s nearly four years old, but the entry-level Steam Deck remains a stellar value for playing PC games on the go. It doesn’t sound like a true successor is coming anytime soon, either. This 20 percent discount ties the best price we’ve seen. Just be aware that the Deck can struggle with some newer AAA games, while SteamOS continues to have compatibility issues with games like Apex Legends or Destiny 2 that use kernel-level anti-cheat systems. Unfortunately, the higher-end Steam Deck OLED models aren’t discounted as of this writing. Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $209 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Black Friday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. If you have a Costco membership, meanwhile, you can get the device for $200 outright. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Black Friday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Black Friday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $30. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Amazon ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. This is another all-time low. You need to be a Prime member to access this deal at Amazon, but the mini and large versions are available directly from Pulsar for the same price. Black Friday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-gaming-deals-for-2025-still-available-save-on-ps5-consoles-nintendo-switch-games-handhelds-and-more-093044679.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Black Friday sales look like a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Black Friday gaming deals we could find below. So far we’re seeing PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards, headsets and other peripherals we like. Black Friday game console deals Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off MSRP): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $499 at Amazon: Yes, we know this isn’t an actual deal, but we note it just to say that we aren’t seeing any discounts on Nintendo’s latest hybrid console as of this writing. This SKU with the newest Mario Kart remains the best “value” if you’re looking to grab the device for the holidays, as you’d have to pay an extra $30 if you bought the console and game separately. Black Friday Nintendo Switch deals Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for $30 at Target ($30 off): Here’s a new low for this HD update to one of Nintendo’s more underappreciated 2D platformers. Originally released for the Wii back in 2010, DKC Returns is a true challenge that exudes character through its level design and Donkey Kong’s thudding movement. Great music, too. Also at Walmart, or at Best Buy and others for $40 if this offer expires. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $30 at Target ($20 off): Echoes of Wisdom makes a few bold changes to the series’ usual formula, mixing the freeform spirit of Tears of the Kingdom (which isn’t on sale) with the top-down view of earlier 2D Zelda games. This deal is a new low. Also for $40 at Amazon, Best Buy and others. Super Mario Odyssey for $30 at Amazon ($30 off): It’s pushing a decade old, but Odyssey remains a joyous 3D platformer with pitch-perfect controls and a relentless stream of inventive ideas. This deal comes within a dollar of the game’s all-time low. Also at Walmart, Best Buy, Target and others. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $30 at Best Buy ($30 off): Here’s a new low for the Switch remake of this beloved GameCube RPG. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar called it an “absolute treasure” in his review last year. Also at Target. Several other first-party Switch exclusives are down to $30 as well, including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Splatoon 3, Nintendo Switch Sports, Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe and Luigi’s Mansion 3. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): The Switch 2 requires new microSD Express cards to expand its storage, and this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s latest model. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a few weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you need more space for a Switch 2, this is the second-best price for Lexar’s most spacious microSD Express card since July and the cheapest 1TB model we can find right now. Best Black Friday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Black Friday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $160 at Amazon ($41 off): This ties the best price to date for Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller, which adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others for $170. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Amazon ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Best Buy and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Final Fantasy XVI for $15 at Amazon ($35 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than most other games in the series. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. This is the best price to date for the PS5 copy. Also at Walmart, or at Xbox and Steam for $25. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Rangarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton of other first-party PS5 games for Black Friday beyond this. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Black Friday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s Black Friday selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device’s recent street price. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Black Friday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Battlefield 6 for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): This latest entry is generally seen as a return to form for the long-running military FPS series — at least when it comes to its chaotic multiplayer suite. If you’ve been meaning to step outside of the Call of Duty bubble, this is a new all-time low. Split Fiction for $30 at Walmart ($20 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. This is the best price we’ve seen for the PS5 copy. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for $40. Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater for $35 at GameStop ($35 off): Metal Gear Solid 3 is on the shortlist of the PS2’s greatest games. Delta is full-scale remake that preserves the original’s core while drastically overhauling its visuals and modernizing its controls. We saw it fall as low as $30 at Amazon and Walmart earlier this week, but this is still a nice drop. Also available for $49 at PlayStation and Xbox if you can only get a digital copy. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds + $10 digital credit for $40 at Amazon ($40 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw earlier this week, but it includes a $10 digital Amazon credit when you redeem the code SONIC10 on the product page or at checkout. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at Xbox ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the Xbox edition. Also at Steam. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox version. Also at Amazon. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Black Friday gaming handheld deals Steam Deck (256GB, LCD) for $319 at Steam ($80 off): It’s nearly four years old, but the entry-level Steam Deck remains a stellar value for playing PC games on the go. It doesn’t sound like a true successor is coming anytime soon, either. This 20 percent discount ties the best price we’ve seen. Just be aware that the Deck can struggle with some newer AAA games, while SteamOS continues to have compatibility issues with games like Apex Legends or Destiny 2 that use kernel-level anti-cheat systems. Unfortunately, the higher-end Steam Deck OLED models aren’t discounted as of this writing. Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $209 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Black Friday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. If you have a Costco membership, meanwhile, you can get the device for $200 outright. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Black Friday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Black Friday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $30. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Amazon ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. This is another all-time low. You need to be a Prime member to access this deal at Amazon, but the mini and large versions are available directly from Pulsar for the same price. Black Friday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-gaming-deals-for-2025-still-available-save-on-ps5-consoles-nintendo-switch-games-handhelds-and-more-093044679.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Nintendo gear is always sought after during the holiday shopping season, but this year likely more so than others. The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was announced earlier this month, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by even in the best Black Friday gaming deals — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts.

          "title": "Black Friday deals under $50 we're still shopping: Apple AirTags, Legos, Ugreen chargers, Blink cameras and more",
          "standfirst": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Scroll through any retailer’s sale pages and you’ll be overwhelmed with choices — not all of them good. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark.Cables, chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented. All are pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk) so you know these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals under $50. Black Friday deals under $50: Engadget's top picks Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and they work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app. That means, if you too are a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants, you can ask one of them to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 previously. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $15 Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too. Bellemonde Kent Paper Screen Protector for iPad (2-pack) for $14 ($4 off with Prime) at Amazon: We named this paper-esque screen protector one of the best iPad accessories for 2025. I put one on my iPad a couple years ago and have been happy ever since. It creates a satisfying texture for the Apple Pencil and it adds a matte, but perfectly clear, finish to the screen. Just be sure to double check you’re grabbing the right size for your particular iPad model. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Best Black Friday deals under $20 Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $19 is hard to beat. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 ($5 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Best Black Friday streaming deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This Black Friday deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. Best Black Friday deals under $35 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $39 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $43 ($37 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $43 ($13 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Moft Sit-stand Laptop Desk for $48 ($12 off with Prime) at Amazon: It’s a little heavy at two pounds, but it folds down flat and will turn any desk into a standing desk — elevating your laptop to elbow height or thereabouts so you can switch up your working position wherever you are. It’s surprisingly stable and one of our picks for the best MacBook accessories. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: Amazon released a batch of new smart security cameras alongside new Echo devices in September. And here they are already on sale. Ain’t Black Friday grand? We’re in the process of testing this one out for our security cameras guide. But for now just know that these weather-resistant boxes can shoot 2K video, a resolution bump from the 1080p of the previous model. It has color low-light vision, two-way talk and 4x zoom. The prior model is on sale for $28. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range. Black Friday gaming deals under $50 Here's a smattering of the best Black Friday gaming deals under $50. For every available Black Friday gaming deal, check out our full guide. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $30 at Target ($20 off): Echoes of Wisdom makes a few bold changes to the series’ usual formula, mixing the freeform spirit of Tears of the Kingdom (which isn’t on sale) with the top-down view of earlier 2D Zelda games. This deal is a new low. Also for $40 at Amazon, Best Buy and others. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $30 at Best Buy ($30 off): Here’s a new low for the Switch remake of this beloved GameCube RPG. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar called it an “absolute treasure” in his review last year. Also at Target and GameStop. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox version. Also at Amazon. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Razer Basilisk V3 wired mouse for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): We highlight this ergonomic model in our buying guide to gaming mice. It’s wired and relatively heavy and bulky but it’s comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Target for $30.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-under-50-were-still-shopping-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-173833013.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Scroll through any retailer’s sale pages and you’ll be overwhelmed with choices — not all of them good. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark.Cables, chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented. All are pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk) so you know these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals under $50. Black Friday deals under $50: Engadget's top picks Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and they work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app. That means, if you too are a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants, you can ask one of them to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 previously. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Best Black Friday deals under $15 Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $12 ($8 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you have an Alexa speaker and a lamp this plug will make the two best of friends. We found the plug easy to set up and it reliably maintains its connections. Just remember it only works with Alexa (either via a speaker or the app on your phone). Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too. Bellemonde Kent Paper Screen Protector for iPad (2-pack) for $14 ($4 off with Prime) at Amazon: We named this paper-esque screen protector one of the best iPad accessories for 2025. I put one on my iPad a couple years ago and have been happy ever since. It creates a satisfying texture for the Apple Pencil and it adds a matte, but perfectly clear, finish to the screen. Just be sure to double check you’re grabbing the right size for your particular iPad model. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Best Black Friday deals under $20 Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $19 is hard to beat. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $20 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $25 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: The difference between this one and other smart plugs is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 ($5 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Best Black Friday streaming deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This Black Friday deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. Best Black Friday deals under $35 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $39 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $43 ($37 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $43 ($13 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Moft Sit-stand Laptop Desk for $48 ($12 off with Prime) at Amazon: It’s a little heavy at two pounds, but it folds down flat and will turn any desk into a standing desk — elevating your laptop to elbow height or thereabouts so you can switch up your working position wherever you are. It’s surprisingly stable and one of our picks for the best MacBook accessories. Nestout Waterproof Power Bank (15K mAh 32W) for $48 ($19 off) at Amazon: This is our favorite outdoor-ready portable battery from our guide to power banks. If you make sure the caps are on properly, the thing is waterproof (we dropped it in a bucket of water). Plus it can accommodate a slew of accessories like a light and stand. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: Amazon released a batch of new smart security cameras alongside new Echo devices in September. And here they are already on sale. Ain’t Black Friday grand? We’re in the process of testing this one out for our security cameras guide. But for now just know that these weather-resistant boxes can shoot 2K video, a resolution bump from the 1080p of the previous model. It has color low-light vision, two-way talk and 4x zoom. The prior model is on sale for $28. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range. Black Friday gaming deals under $50 Here's a smattering of the best Black Friday gaming deals under $50. For every available Black Friday gaming deal, check out our full guide. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $30 at Target ($20 off): Echoes of Wisdom makes a few bold changes to the series’ usual formula, mixing the freeform spirit of Tears of the Kingdom (which isn’t on sale) with the top-down view of earlier 2D Zelda games. This deal is a new low. Also for $40 at Amazon, Best Buy and others. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $30 at Best Buy ($30 off): Here’s a new low for the Switch remake of this beloved GameCube RPG. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar called it an “absolute treasure” in his review last year. Also at Target and GameStop. Elden Ring for $15 at Walmart ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This is a new low, but as of this writing it only applies to the Xbox version. Also at Amazon. The PS5 copy is down to $20, which is still a decent savings. Razer Basilisk V3 wired mouse for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): We highlight this ergonomic model in our buying guide to gaming mice. It’s wired and relatively heavy and bulky but it’s comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Target for $30.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-deals-under-50-were-still-shopping-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-173833013.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV, and this year is no different. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find. The discounts include well-reviewed OLED TVs and budget sets alike from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and Hisense. For those happy with their current TV, there are also several deals on media streamers and streaming services we like. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (48-inch) for $530 at Best Buy ($770 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal matches the best price we've seen for the 48-inch version. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Samsung The Frame TV (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $798 at Amazon ($100 off): You shouldn’t buy a Samsung’s Frame TV if you want the best picture quality for your dollar: They lack local dimming and Dolby Vision HDR, and some cheaper alternatives lap them when it comes to brightness and contrast. Instead, you’d buy one if care about your TV’s aesthetic above all else, since they’re designed to look like a framed piece of wall art. This set also has a matte screen finish, so it holds up well against glare and direct reflections. This discount brings the 55-inch version within $20 of the best price we’ve tracked. Just note that we’re highlighting the 2024 model; this year’s edition is also on sale for $100 more, but its panel still isn’t great the price, so we recommend saving as much cash as possible if you’re dead-set on buying one of these things. Also at Best Buy and Samsung. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up LG C5 (65-inch) for $1,247 at Amazon ($200 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in a well-lit room. It also has all the essential gaming features, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the 65-inch model; other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch sets can’t get as bright as the larger versions. Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target. Best Black Friday streaming service deals Apple TV 6-month subscription for $36 at Apple ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for $36, which comes out to $6 per month for the discounted period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show or Pluribus for less. The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 at Sling ($4 off): Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's 30-plus channels, including ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-are-still-available-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-181143975.html?src=rss",

Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target. Best Black Friday streaming service deals Apple TV 6-month subscription for $36 at Apple ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for $36, which comes out to $6 per month for the discounted period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show or Pluribus for less. The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 at Sling ($4 off): Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's 30-plus channels, including ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-are-still-available-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-181143975.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is technically over, but long gone are the days in which all of the deals dry up at midnight. Black Friday is very much a multi-day event now, with most of the best deals (as long as they don’t sell out) lasting through Cyber Monday. This year, we’ve found some of the best prices of the year on tech like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, speakers and more.Below, we’ve collected the best Black Friday deals you can still get today. We expect many of these to run through Cyber Monday this year, but we'll keep this post updated as we account for possible sell-outs and any new deals we can find that are worth your money. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $274 (21 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. PlayStation 5 digital edition for $399 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off): Sonos' most premium soundbar offers crisp, clear sound and an impressive bass boost over the original. It has a sleek design and works with the Sonos Ace headphones as well. There are plenty of other Sonos Black Friday deals to consider as well, both on Amazon and direct at Sonos. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $69 (47 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Black Friday deals under $50 LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Black Friday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Black Friday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year.

One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off): Sonos' most premium soundbar offers crisp, clear sound and an impressive bass boost over the original. It has a sleek design and works with the Sonos Ace headphones as well. There are plenty of other Sonos Black Friday deals to consider as well, both on Amazon and direct at Sonos. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Black Friday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Black Friday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $69 (47 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Black Friday deals under $50 LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Black Friday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Black Friday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

          "standfirst": "Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for Black Friday. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in our review, now for less. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

          "title": "Black Friday VPN deals are still live: Get 75 percent off Proton VPN two-year plans, plus deals on NordVPN, ExpressVPN and more",
          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries.

Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 are already shaping up to be one of the most sought-after tech gifts this season, and now you can grab them at a lower price. They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $139 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $69. If you prefer over-ear headphones, select colors of the AirPods Max are down to $400.

Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment.

That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month.

          "title": "Apple Black Friday deals: Pick up the iPad A16 for its lowest price yet",
          "standfirst": "The iPad A16 is now on sale for $274 for Black Friday, giving you a chance to pick up Apple’s newest entry-level tablet at a discount. It’s the most affordable iPad in the current lineup, offering quick performance, strong battery life and all the essentials for everyday use. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $274, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $274, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

          "standfirst": "As streaming platforms continue to raise their prices, Paramount+ is offering a more budget-friendly way to catch up on shows and live sports with a Black Friday streaming deal. Thanks to this new deal, you’ll be able to get two months of access for $3 per month, or a total of only $6. The deal applies to both the Essential and Premium plans, letting new users try out the service without committing to a full subscription. Paramount+ continues to expand its catalog with a mix of current CBS shows, exclusive originals, classic TV and live sports. The service is available in two main tiers: Essential, which includes ads, and Premium, which removes most of them and adds a few key extras like 4K streaming, offline downloads and live CBS access. Both tiers include select Showtime programming, giving subscribers a taste of the premium network’s lineup. The Essential plan provides access to more than 40,000 episodes and movies, along with live coverage of the NFL on CBS and UEFA Champions League matches. It supports up to three simultaneous streams, making it a practical choice for households that share accounts. The Premium plan builds on that by offering ad-free on-demand viewing (with exceptions for live broadcasts), higher-quality playback and the option to watch CBS live in participating regions. Paramount+’s growing library combines new releases with well-known favorites, offering titles from across CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Sports fans get live coverage of key events, while movie watchers can find recent cinema releases from Paramount Pictures joining the lineup throughout the year. The inclusion of Showtime series in both plans adds another layer of variety, with dramas and documentaries available alongside the core Paramount+ content. If you’re keeping an eye on subscription costs, an offer like this is a practical way to test the service without paying full price. It also gives you time to see whether the Essential plan’s ad-supported setup or the Premium tier’s extras are worth the difference. If you’ve been watching your streaming spend as prices go up elsewhere, this deal from Paramount+ offers a well-balanced opportunity to experience both plan levels at a lower cost. Paramount+ is one of the best streaming services thanks to its vast selection of original shows like Star Trek: Discovery, Ink Master and Frasier. If you’re ready to stream big shows and live events without a heavy commitment this Cyber Monday offer is one to keep in mind. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Black Friday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Black Friday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others.

          "standfirst": "HBO Max has rolled out a limited-time, one-year subscription deal, offering a chance to stream HBO originals and Warner Bros. blockbusters at a lower cost. The platform has reduced pricing to $3 per month for one year, bringing the final cost down to $36 for the year. With many streaming services increasing their rates, this Black Friday streaming deal lets you catch up on hit shows and new releases without committing to a full year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost. There are plenty of other Black Friday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1.

The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Black Friday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages.

          "standfirst": "As is the case with most tech products, Black Friday is a decent chance to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts you can still get right now. It's not the most plentiful time for SSD deals more generally these days, but we're still seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards. We'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off MSRP): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. The 1TB version is also worth noting at $186; that's not an all-time low, but it's the best price we can find for a microSD Express card with that much capacity right now. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T705 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $160 at B&H ($39 off): If you need a bit more space from a PCIe 5.0 drive, the Crucial T705 is a slightly older but still highly rated alternative with blazing-fast speeds. This discount comes within $10 of the 2TB version’s all-time low. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $190 at B&H ($130 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. It’s usually retailed for $250 in recent months. Also at Best Buy. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $750 at B&H ($270 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($111 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. While this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-ssd-deals-include-up-to-250-off-recommended-internal-and-portable-ssds-microsd-cards-and-more-175429476.html?src=rss",

If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. It’s usually retailed for $250 in recent months. Also at Best Buy. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $750 at B&H ($270 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($111 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. While this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-ssd-deals-include-up-to-250-off-recommended-internal-and-portable-ssds-microsd-cards-and-more-175429476.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Anthropic says it solved the long-running AI agent problem with a new multi-session Claude SDK",
          "standfirst": "Agent memory remains a problem that enterprises want to fix, as agents forget some instructions or conversations the longer they run. Anthropic believes it has solved this issue for its Claude Agent SDK, developing a two-fold solution that allows an agent to work across different context windows.“The core challenge of long-running agents is that they must work in discrete sessions, and each new session begins with no memory of what came before,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. “Because context windows are limited, and because most complex projects cannot be completed within a single window, agents need a way to bridge the gap between coding sessions.”Anthropic engineers proposed a two-fold approach for its Agent SDK: An initializer agent to set up the environment, and a coding agent to make incremental progress in each session and leave artifacts for the next. The agent memory problemSince agents are built on foundation models, they remain constrained by the limited, although continually growing, context windows. For long-running agents, this could create a larger problem, leading the agent to forget instructions and behave abnormally while performing a task. Enhancing agent memory becomes essential for consistent, business-safe performance. Several methods emerged over the past year, all attempting to bridge the gap between context windows and agent memory. LangChain’s LangMem SDK, Memobase and OpenAI’s Swarm are examples of companies offering memory solutions. Research on agentic memory has also exploded recently, with proposed frameworks like Memp and the Nested Learning Paradigm from Google offering new alternatives to enhance memory. Many of the current memory frameworks are open source and can ideally adapt to different large language models (LLMs) powering agents. Anthropic’s approach improves its Claude Agent SDK. How it worksAnthropic identified that even though the Claude Agent SDK had context management capabilities and “should be possible for an agent to continue to do useful work for an arbitrarily long time,” it was not sufficient. The company said in its blog post that a model like Opus 4.5 running the Claude Agent SDK can “fall short of building a production-quality web app if it’s only given a high-level prompt, such as &#x27;build a clone of claude.ai.&#x27;” The failures manifested in two patterns, Anthropic said. First, the agent tried to do too much, causing the model to run out of context in the middle. The agent then has to guess what happened and cannot pass clear instructions to the next agent. The second failure occurs later on, after some features have already been built. The agent sees progress has been made and just declares the job done. Anthropic researchers broke down the solution: Setting up an initial environment to lay the foundation for features and prompting each agent to make incremental progress towards a goal, while still leaving a clean slate at the end. This is where the two-part solution of Anthropic&#x27;s agent comes in. The initializer agent sets up the environment, logging what agents have done and which files have been added. The coding agent will then ask models to make incremental progress and leave structured updates. “Inspiration for these practices came from knowing what effective software engineers do every day,” Anthropic said. The researchers said they added testing tools to the coding agent, improving its ability to identify and fix bugs that weren’t obvious from the code alone. Future researchAnthropic noted that its approach is “one possible set of solutions in a long-running agent harness.” However, this is just the beginning stage of what could become a wider research area for many in the AI space. The company said its experiments to boost long-term memory for agents haven’t shown whether a single general-purpose coding agent works best across contexts or a multi-agent structure. Its demo also focused on full-stack web app development, so other experiments should focus on generalizing the results across different tasks.“It’s likely that some or all of these lessons can be applied to the types of long-running agentic tasks required in, for example, scientific research or financial modeling,” Anthropic said.",

          "content": "Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’ Jill of the Jungle illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.) Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of Tomb Raider‘s Lara Croft, Horizon Forbidden West‘s Aloy, Life is Strange‘s Max Caulfield, Returnal‘s Selene Vassos, Control‘s Jesse Faden, The Last of Us‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games Mass Effect and Cyberpunk 2077 seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives. As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives. But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible. In two independent trials using infusions of engineered antibodies, some participants remained healthy without taking antiretrovirals, long after the interventions ended. In one of the trials—the FRESH trial, led by virologist Thumbi Ndung’u of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa—four of 20 participants maintained undetectable levels of HIV for a median of 1.5 years without taking antiretrovirals. In the other, the RIO trial set in the United Kingdom and Denmark and led by Sarah Fidler, a clinical doctor and HIV research expert at Imperial College London, six of 34 HIV-positive participants have maintained viral control for at least two years.Read full article Comments",
