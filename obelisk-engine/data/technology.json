          "content": "OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. For software and services that connect to a new ChatGPT SDK, now you can tag in their apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map that the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. Developers can access the SDK for making apps in preview starting today. Later this year, developers will be able to submit apps for review and publication, and OpenAI also plans to offer a directory for users to browse apps, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The company will share guidance about monetization “soon,” Altman says.",

          "standfirst": "October Prime Day is on the horizon, so it’s time to start thinking about what you may want to snag at a discount during the sale tomorrow. If you pay the $139 annual fee for Prime, sale events like these are a great time to stock up on essentials and cross things off your wishlist while you can save some money.Most discounts will be exclusively available to Prime subscribers, but there are always a few that anyone shopping on Amazon can grab. Similarly, there are always early deals in the days and weeks leading up to Prime Day, and this year is no different. Here, we’ve collected the best Prime Day deals you can shop for right now and we’ll keep updating this post as we get close to Prime Day proper. October Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $90 (30 percent off): Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are the best AirPods for folks on a budget. They have an open-ear design that some will prefer over eartips that stick into your ears full, plus they have much improved audio quality and the H2 chip that enables features like Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 (20 percent off): Our top pick for the best laptop for most people, the latest MacBook Air is impressively thin and light without skimping on performance. The M4 chipset is powerful enough to handle everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, plus some gaming and labor-intensive work. It has a comfortable keyboard, luxe-feeling trackpad and an excellent battery life. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off, Prime exclusive): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. October Prime Day deals on tech Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 (24 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 (42 percent off): These ultra-affordable wireless earbuds are 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the previous model, and they have a mobile app in which you can choose from three preset EQ modes to customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours, and they come with three different sizes of eartips so you can get the best fit. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. Anker 622 5K magnetic foldable power bank with stand for $34 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 (50 percent off): Blink makes some of our favorite security cameras, and the Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring. It can be placed outside with the right weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. JBL Go 4 portable speaker for $40 (20 percent off): The Go 4 is a handy little Bluetooth speaker that you can take anywhere you go thanks to its small, IP67-rated design and built-in carrying loop. It'll get seven hours of playtime on a single charge, and you can pair two together for stereo sound. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E. It also has double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 (44 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. Anker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $63 (22 percent off, Prime exclusive): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones. Levoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $70 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off): This entry-level robot vacuum is an upgraded version of one of our favorite budget robot vacuums. iRobot makes robovacs that are easy to use, even for those who have never had a machine like this, and they do a good job of cleaning up all kinds of messes, including pet hair. Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): If you're looking for an autonomous dirt-sucker that can also mop, this is a good option. It has a mopping pad and water reservoir built in, and it supports home mapping as well. Its self-emptying base can hold up to 60 days worth of debris, too. Amazon Kindle Scribe for $300 (25 percent off): The latest Kindle Scribe is one of the best E Ink tablets you can get, particularly if you want a slab that can handle both note-taking and e-reading well. Its edge is providing users full access to the Kindle ebook store and the ability to take notes to accompany reading material. This model has 16GB of storage and includes the Premium Pen. XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-58-percent-off-on-apple-samsung-lego-dyson-shark-and-others-before-the-sale-begins-050801654.html?src=rss",

XReal One Pro AR glasses for $649 (16 percent off): The latest from XReal, these smart glasses can let you use almost any device, including your smartphone, with a large virtual display. Their 1080p Micro-OLED screens are bright and sharp, plus they're pretty comfortable to wear. Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-get-up-to-58-percent-off-on-apple-samsung-lego-dyson-shark-and-others-before-the-sale-begins-050801654.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI launched an agent builder that the company hopes will eliminate fragmented tools and make it easier for enterprises to utilize OpenAI’s system to create agents. AgentKit, announced during OpenAI’s DevDay in San Francisco, enables developers and enterprises to build agents and add chat capabilities in one place, potentially competing with platforms like Zapier. By offering a more streamlined way to create agents, OpenAI advances further into becoming a full-stack application provider.“Until now, building agents meant juggling fragmented tools—complex orchestration with no versioning, custom connectors, manual eval pipelines, prompt tuning, and weeks of frontend work before launch,” the company said in a blog post. AgentKit includes:Agent Builder, which is a visual canvas where devs can see what they’ve created and versioning multi-agent workflowsConnector Registry is a central area for admins to manage connections across OpenAI products. A Global Admin console will be a prerequisite to using this feature.ChatKit enables users to integrate chat-based agents into their user interfaces. Eventually, OpenAI said it will build a standalone Workflows API and add agent deployment tabs to ChatGPT. OpenAI also expanded evaluation for agents, adding capabilities such as datasets with automated graders and annotations, trace grading that runs end-to-end assessments of workflows, automated prompt optimization, and support for third-party agent measurement tools. Developers can access some features of AgentKit, but OpenAI is gradually rolling out additional features, such as Agent Builder. Currently, Agent Builder is available in beta, while ChatKit and new evaluation capabilities are generally available. Connector Registry “is beginning its beta rollout to some API and ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users. OpenAI said pricing for AgentKit tools will be included in the standard API model pricing. Agent BuilderTo clarify, many agents are built using OpenAI’s models; however, enterprises often access GPT-5 through other platforms to create their own agents. However, AgentKit brings enterprises more into its ecosystem, ensuring they don’t need to tap other platforms as often. Demonstrated during DevDay, the company stated that Agent Builder is ideal for rapid iteration. It also provides developers with visibility into how the agents are working. During the demo, an OpenAI developer made an agent that reads the DevDay agenda and suggests panels to watch. It took her just under eight minutes. Other model providers saw the importance of offering developer toolkits to build agents to entice enterprises to use more of their tools. Google came out with its Agent Development Kit in April, expanding multi-agent system building “in under 100 lines of code.” Microsoft, which runs the popular agent framework AutoGen, announced it is bringing agent creation to one place with its new Agent Framework.OpenAI customers, such as the fintech company Ramp, stated in a blog post that its teams were able to build a procurement agent in a few hours instead of months. “Agent Builder transformed what once took months of complex orchestration, custom code, and manual optimizations into just a couple of hours. The visual canvas keeps product, legal, and engineering on the same page, slashing iteration cycles by 70% and getting an agent live in two sprints rather than two quarters,” Ramp said. AgentKit’s Connector Registry would also enable enterprises to manage and maintain data across workspaces, consolidating data sources into a single panel that spans both ChatGPT and the API. It will have pre-built connectors to Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. It also supports third-party MCP servers. Another capability of Agent Builder is Guardrails, an open-source safety layer that protects against the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), jailbreaks, and unintended or malicious behavior.Bringing more chat Since most agentic interactions involve chat, it makes sense to simplify the process for developers to set up chat interfaces and connect them with the agents they’ve just built. “Deploying chat UIs for agents can be surprisingly complex—handling streaming responses, managing threads, showing the model thinking and designing engaging in-chat experiences,” OpenAI said. The company said ChatKit makes it simple to embed chat agents on platforms and embed these into apps or websites. However, some OpenAI competitors have begun thinking beyond the chatbot and want to offer agentic interactions that feel more seamless. Google’s asynchronous coding agent, Jules, has introduced a new feature that enables users to interact with the agent through the command-line interface, eliminating the need to open a chat window. Responses The response to AgentKit has mainly been positive, with some developers noting that while it simplifies agent building, it doesn’t mean that everyone can now build agents. Several developers view Agent Kit not as a Zapier killer, but rather as a tool that complements the pipeline. Zapier debuted a no-code tool for building AI agents and bots, called Zapier Central, in 2024.",

OpenAI announced the integration, which is enabled by the company’s new Apps SDK, during its DevDay presentation. As of today, ChatGPT can connect to a handful of apps, with more to come over time and OpenAI working on submission guidelines that will allow developers to monetize their work. As a ChatGPT user, you can any access available third-party app by referencing it in your conversations with the chatbot. In the case of Spotify, for example, you can write “Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday.” The first time you mention an app in this way, you’ll be prompted to connect your account to ChatGPT. When working with Spotify, ChatGPT can make recommendations based on a mood, theme or a topic. The interface will eventually lead you to Spotify itself, where you can listen to what ChatGPT has created. “It’s early days, so while we might not be able to deliver on every request just yet, we’ll continue to build, refine, and improve the experience over the coming weeks and months,” Spotify says of the integration.OpenAI showed off other apps working inside of ChatGPT. For instance, an employee demoed Canva creating a few posters for a dog-walking business that they had talked to ChatGPT about starting. With today’s announcement, ChatGPT can connect to Canva, Coursera, Figma, Spotify and Zillow. In the coming weeks, DoorDash, OpenTable, Target and Uber will also work with the chatbot. And later this year, OpenAI says it will begin accepting app submissions for review and publication.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI&#x27;s annual conference for third-party developers, DevDay, kicked off with a bang today as co-founder and CEO Sam Altman announced a new \"Apps SDK\" that makes it \"possible to build apps inside of ChatGPT,\" including paid apps, which companies can charge users for using OpenAI&#x27;s recently unveiled Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). In other words, instead of launching apps one-by-one on your phone, computer, or on the web — now you can do all that without ever leaving ChatGPT. This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or ask Coursera about a specific lesson&#x27;s content while dit plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offering their own connections (see below).\"This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with,\" Altman said.While the Apps SDK is available today in preview, OpenAI said it would not begin accepting new apps within ChatGPT or allow them to charge users until \"later this year.\"ChatGPT in-line app access is already rolling out to ChatGPT Free, Plus, Go and Pro users — outside of the European Union only for now — with Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers expected to receive access to the apps later this year.Built atop common MCP standardBuilt on the open source standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by rival Anthropic nearly a year ago, the Apps SDK gives third-party developers working independently or on behalf of enterprises large and small to connect selected data, \"trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI [user interface]\" Altman explained during his introductory keynote speech. The Apps SDK includes a \"talking to apps\" feature that allows ChatGPT and the underlying GPT-5 or other \"o-series\" models piloting it underneath to obtain updated context from the third-party app or service, so the model \"always knows about exactly what you&#x27;re user is interacting with,\" according to another presenter and OpenAI engineer, Alexi Christakis.Developers can build apps that:appear inline in chat as lightweight cards or carouselsexpand to fullscreen for immersive tasks like maps, menus, or slidesuse picture-in-picture for live sessions such as video, games, or quizzesEach mode is designed to preserve ChatGPT’s minimal, conversational flow while adding interactivity and brand presence.Early integrations with Coursera, Canva, Zillow and more...Christakis showed off early integrations of external apps built atop the Apps SDK, including ones from e-learning company Coursera, cloud design software company Canva, and real estate listings and agent connections search engine, Zillow.Altman also announced Apps SDK integrations with additional partners not demoed officially during the keynote including: Booking.com, Expedia, Figma and Spotify and in documentation, said more upcoming partners are on deck: AllTrails, Peloton, OpenTable, Target, theFork, and Uber, representing lifestyle, commerce, and productivity categories.The Coursera demo included an example of how the user onboards to the external app, including a new login screen for the app (Coursera) that appears within the ChatGPT chat interface, activated simply by a text prompt from the user asking: \"Coursera can you teach me something about machine learning\"?Once logged in, the app launched within the chat interface, \"in line\" and can render anything from the web, including interactive elements like video. Christakis explained and showed the Apps SDK also supports \"picture-in-picture\" and \"fullscreen\" views, allowing the user to choose how to interact with it.When playing a Coursera video that appeared, he showed that it automatically pinned the video to the top of the screen so the user could keep watching it even as they continued to have a back-and-forth dialog in text with ChatGPT in the typical input/output prompts and responses below. Users can then ask ChatGPT about content appearing in the video without specifying exactly what was said, as the Agents SDK pipes the information on the backend, server-side, from the connected app to the underlying ChatGPT AI model. So \"can you explain more about what they&#x27;re saying right now\" will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.In another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he&#x27;d had about his siblings&#x27; dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app, Canva, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT&#x27;s recommended business names, \"Walk This Wag,\" along with specific guidance about font choice (\"sans serif\") and overall coloration and style (\"bright and colorful.\")Instead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.After a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user&#x27;s ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.Christakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app, Zillow.He started a new chat session and asked a simple question: \"based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.\"Using ChatGPT&#x27;s optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in \"Zillow\" and \"show me some homes for sale there,\" which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.Clicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with \"most of the Zillow experience,\" entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.The user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as \"how close is it to a dog park?\" — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.It can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.Safety, privacy, and developer standardsOpenAI emphasized that apps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content standards to be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:serve a clear and valuable purposebe predictable and reliable in behaviorbe safe for general audiences, including teens aged 13–17respect user privacy and limit data collection to only what’s necessaryEvery app must also include a clear, published privacy policy, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from verified accounts, provide customer support contacts, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.OpenAI also published developer design guidelines, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain “conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,” according to the documentation.A new conversational app ecosystemBy opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged AI operating system — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.For developers, that means direct access to over 800 million ChatGPT users, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.For users, it means a new generation of apps you can chat with — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped GPT Store, which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back.",

          "title": "Evernote's biggest update since 2020 goes all in on AI",
          "standfirst": "If you're like me, it's probably been a hot minute since you've thought about Evernote. For years, the note-taking app, once a darling of the App Store, faced declining popularity and profitability. The last time it grabbed headlines was in 2022 when it was sold to Milan-based developer Bending Spoons. Approximately nine months later, Bending Spoons laid off nearly all of Evernote's US workforce, and relocated what remained of the company's operations to Europe. Now, Evernote wants to be in the conversation again. Since taking over the app, Bending Spoons has released more than 200 improvements, culminating today with the release of Evernote v11. The company is touting the update, which is the first major release for Evernote since its poorly received v10 release back in 2020. The new version brings a handful of new AI features to Evernote, including one that Bending Spoons collaborated with OpenAI to develop. \"My wish for v11 is that people give it a try and see how fast and reliable it is, how complete it is in what it offers,\" Federico Simionato, Evenote's product lead, said over a video chat. \"I think people have an outdated opinion of Evernote that used to match reality, when Evernote was slow and unreliable.\" The first of the new features Bending Spoons is introducing today is called AI Assistant. Simionato describes it as having ChatGPT inside of Evernote. No surprise since the company collaborated with OpenAI to make it. As you can probably guess, you can use AI Assistant to search through your notes and notebooks, but the tool's utility goes beyond that. It allows you to interact with your documents and ask follow-up questions. AI Assistant can also generate new content, and you can decide how what it creates is integrated within your existing notes and notebooks. In my demo, Simionato used AI Assistant to add a flight ticket number to a note he had dedicated to an upcoming trip to Spain. Over time, Bending Spoons plans to make AI Assistant more powerful, with the company working on making it possible for the chatbot to assign tags to notes and perform bulk actions across multiple documents, among other capabilities. By default, Bending Spoons will enable AI Assistant for all paid users. A set of granular controls will allow people to decide what content AI Assistant can access. The agreement Bending Spoons has with OpenAI means the company can't train its models on data from Evernote users. Additionally, any data sent to the cloud for processing will only be held as long it takes to complete the user's request. Part of the reason Bending Spoons is taking a more forward approach with AI Assistant is due to user feedback. In 2023, the company released a tool called AI Search. Simionato says his team was \"extremely careful\" to add friction to the experience to ensure people felt Evernote was respecting their privacy. To that end, you had to dig into the app's settings to enable AI Search before it would work. According to Simionato, users found that setup was \"too cumbersome,\" and with most people becoming more comfortable with AI tools, the company decided to make AI Assistant visible from the jump. The other new feature Bending Spoons is introducing today is one some Evernote users have been waiting for a decade: Semantic Search. Instead of trying to find a note using an exact word or phrase you used inside of it, Semantic Search allows Evernote to filter through your documents using context. Simionato demonstrates the feature in action by typing \"Barcelona trip\" into the new interface, and Evernote surfaces a note he created about a trip to Girona. If you're not familiar, Girona is a city about 62 miles northeast of Barcelona and part of Catalonia. The document Evernote pulled up had no mention of Barcelona in it, but that didn't prevent the tool from finding it. According to Simionato, this is the most requested feature of longtime Evernote users and one Bending Spoons is happy it can finally deliver on. Lastly, the company has expanded the app's built-in recording and transcription capabilities. Building on AI Transcribe, which Bending Spoons first introduced in 2024, Evernote can now record audio from both in-person and online meetings and automatically transcribe and summarize what's said. This feature should work in every language that Evernote currently supports. As mentioned, Evernote's new AI features are available to all paid users. The features will roll out to desktop and web first starting this month, with mobile to follow. Simionato said Bending Spoons is working on making a trail available to free users sometime in the next few months. For now, the price of Evernote's paid plans isn't going up, but Simionato noted the company plans to adjust pricing in the coming months, mostly to account for the fact there aren't many notable differences between the Personal and Professional tiers.

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums are more than just a gimmick. Sure, we all enjoy anthropomorphizing a Roomba from time to time, but they're not gadgets for the sake of gadgetry — keeping your living space clean is an incredibly rewarding task to automate. The only problem is that robot vacuums, and frankly all decent vacuums, are expensive. Fortunately, the steep discounts offered on Amazon this October Prime Day make the purchase a lot more justifiable, whether you want a robot buddy or a traditional vacuum cleaner. In this article, we're sharing a constantly updated list of Prime Day vacuum deals worth taking advantage of. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $410 (38 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $459 (29 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (55 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (36 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $250 (29 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $55 (21 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You can snap up a lot of useful tech for less than $50 during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale. We’re seeing discounts on streaming devices, mini speakers, earbuds, power banks, wall chargers, and more. But this isn’t just random drek. The deals highlighted here are pulled from our own guides and reviews —these are gadgets and accessories we’ve tried ourselves and currently recommend. If you’re looking for small electronics and accessories (or if you just want to fill your Amazon cart without spending too much) this list of the best Prime Day deals under $50 is a great place to start. Best Prime Day deals under $50 UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $45 ($11 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Amazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. It’s good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Lego Star Wars: The Mandalorian Paz Vizsla and Moff Gideon Battle for $17 (56 percent off): You can have a tiny version of the dramatic season-three battle from The Mandalorian to admire whenever you want. This 289-piece set is rated for kids seven and up, but no one will judge if you keep it for your own shelves. Check out more Lego sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $34 ($14 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $45 ($25 off): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 ($30 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 ($35 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",
          "content": "You can snap up a lot of useful tech for less than $50 during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale. We’re seeing discounts on streaming devices, mini speakers, earbuds, power banks, wall chargers, and more. But this isn’t just random drek. The deals highlighted here are pulled from our own guides and reviews —these are gadgets and accessories we’ve tried ourselves and currently recommend. If you’re looking for small electronics and accessories (or if you just want to fill your Amazon cart without spending too much) this list of the best Prime Day deals under $50 is a great place to start. Best Prime Day deals under $50 UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $45 ($11 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Amazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. It’s good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Lego Star Wars: The Mandalorian Paz Vizsla and Moff Gideon Battle for $17 (56 percent off): You can have a tiny version of the dramatic season-three battle from The Mandalorian to admire whenever you want. This 289-piece set is rated for kids seven and up, but no one will judge if you keep it for your own shelves. Check out more Lego sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $34 ($14 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $45 ($25 off): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 ($30 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 ($35 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, but Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale looks like a decent opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. While the two-day event doesn't officially start until tomorrow, a number of well-regarded TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL and other manufacturers are at or near their best prices to date right now. You can find our full list of the best Prime Day TV deals below, along with a handful of discounts on streaming devices we like. We'll update this roundup as prices change and new offers arise over the course of the event. Best Prime Day TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED TV for $598 ($100 off): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This is only $1 more than the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Other sizes are similarly discounted. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something that’s better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve tracked since July. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,298 ($300 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. (The S90F has a more colorful image, though.) This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 55-inch OLED TV for $1,297 ($503 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This ties the lowest price we’ve found for the 55-inch model; other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,998 ($502 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. Outside of an extremely brief dip in June, this deal matches the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-save-on-sets-from-lg-samsung-tcl-and-others-180051219.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Apple's AirPods 4 drop to $90 for Prime Day",
          "standfirst": "Those on a tight budget and those who prefer open-ear AirPods will want to check out the latest discount on the AirPods 4. Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are down to $90 for October Prime Day, or 30 percent off their normal rate. That's also the lowest we've seen them. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $140 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $140 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

          "standfirst": "October Prime Day is almost here again, and as always, we've put together a list of the best, most-discounted extra storage options for consoles and gaming PCs. Our guide to the top storage deals is split into three categories — tiny microSD cards, portable external SSDs and generally faster (but more labor-intensive) internal SSDs. Whether you're building a gaming rig or just want to stop your PS5 from lagging, there's almost certainly a deal for you on our curated list. Take a look now to see what kind of extra storage might best fit your needs. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD, but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s — all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $64 (33 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $122 (49 percent off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is available at the lowest price we've seen all year. It's a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $170 (19 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $89 (23 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $249 (31 percent off): This SeaGate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-deals-save-on-gear-from-samsung-crucial-seagate-and-others-170039409.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting for a discount before grabbing a new iPad, MacBook or Apple Watch, Amazon’s October Prime Day sale might be worth checking out. Prime Big Deal Days, as it’s officially called, doesn’t technically begin until tomorrow, but we’re keeping an eye out for the best Apple deals that are going on in the lead-up to the event. So far, the selection is pretty strong, with the AirPods 4, iPad Air, MacBook Air and several other devices at or near the lowest prices we've seen. You can find our full roundup below, and we’ll be updating this post over the course of the two-day event as more offers pop up. Best Prime Day Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $90 ($39 off): The entry-level AirPods get you tons of Apple-friendly features — from fast pairing with your iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri — and their lightweight design should fit most ears more comfortably than previous models. They still aren’t the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair, and they don't support wireless charging, Find My tracking or built-in volume controls. They won’t block much outside noise either. But if you’re an iPhone owner who truly hates the feeling of earphones that jut into your ear canal, they’re a worthy value with this discount, which comes within a dollar of the lowest price we’ve seen. Engadget’s Billy Steele gave the AirPods 4 a review score of 88 last year. Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $430 ($119 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weird, flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, they offer most of the conveniences of the in-ear AirPods, while their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s all-time low, but it’s the best price we’ve seen since July. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): We call the Air the best Apple tablet for most people in our guide to the best iPads. While it’s a good bit more expensive than the base model, it has a handful of subtle improvements that add up in day-to-day use. Its speakers are better. Its display is more color-rich, more glare-resistant and laminated, which means there’s no “gap” between the display and the actual glass. There’s a faster chip and more RAM for gaming or more involved tasks. It also works with the Apple Pencil Pro and comfier Magic Keyboard. This $150 discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Other sizes and storage configurations are also similarly discounted. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as the 11-inch model, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. It should be nice if you’re willing to trade a little portability for more space for working or taking in movies. We gave this model a score of 89 in our review back in March. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you want a display you can more easily hold with one hand. This is another deal we've seen several times, but it's only $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): With its enormous finding network and ultra-wideband tech for accurately locating nearby items, Apple’s AirTag is the top pick for iPhone users in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers. This deal comes within a dollar of the best price we've seen for a four-pack. If you’re not in desperate need for these, though, note that we may see an updated model later this year. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This deal is slightly higher than the laptop’s all-time low, and it’s another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s a decent drop from Apple’s usual list price. Again, other versions with more memory and storage are also on sale. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) for $390 ($9 off): The Series 11 is the top overall pick in our guide to the best smartwatches. It’s not as compelling as the SE 3 from a value perspective, but it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, slightly longer battery life and support for more advanced health features like hypertension alerts and an ECG app. We gave it a score of 90 in our review. Just note that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you’re happy with your current Apple Watch. This is a slight $9 discount, but we note it since the Series 11 has been on sale for less than a month, so any bit of savings are welcome. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile discount for a version of last year’s model with cellular support. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches a couple weeks ago, but Amazon is selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since this is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-deals-on-apple-devices-save-on-airpods-ipads-airtags-and-more-125644485.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, rice cookers, Breville appliances, Vitamix hand blenders and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $180 ($50 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Note the price was $20 lower for Prime members back in July. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-get-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-and-more-193009513.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, rice cookers, Breville appliances, Vitamix hand blenders and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model.

          "standfirst": "You may not be looking to spend big on tech this October Prime Day, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it.For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "So you need a new laptop — now’s the time of year to look out for one on sale. October Prime Day, as has been in years past, offers a ton of laptop deals to consider. All kinds of devices are on sale this year for Big Deal Days, from refreshed MacBooks to high-end gaming machines to already affordable notebooks. But sussing out a good deal from a just-ok deal (or even worse, a bad deal all together), can be a challenge. Laptop prices for machines from Lenovo, Dell, Acer and others on Amazon are all over the place even when it’s not Prime Day depending on the configuration of the notebook, the seller and a bunch of other factors.This is where Engadget can help. We’ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. As always, if you’re super particular about the display panel you want in your next laptop, or you know you want to get as much RAM as possible, we recommend going straight to manufacturers to customize your next PC. But if you’re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 (17 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $649 (28 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i7) for $800 (27 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver. Lenovo Ideapad 3 Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $230 (77 percent off) HP HD Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Pentium N200) for $287 (18 percent off) Acer Chromebook Plus (14-inch, Intel Core i3) for $360 (10 percent off) This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-amazon-prime-day-laptop-deals-discounts-on-machines-from-apple-lenovo-dell-hp-and-more-130507738.html?src=rss",

The Battery Doorbell Plus offers a 150-by-150-degree \"head to toe\" field of vision and 1536p high-resolution video. This makes it a lot easier to see boxes dropped off at your front door since it doesn't cut off the bottom of the image like a lot of video doorbells. This model features motion detection, privacy zones, color night vision and Live View with two-way talk, among other features. Installation is a breeze since you don't have to hardwire it to your existing doorbell wiring. Most users report that the battery lasts between several weeks and several months depending on how users set up the video doorbell, with power-heavy features like motion detection consuming more battery life. With most video doorbells today, you need a subscription to get the most out of them, and Ring is no exception. Features like package alerts require a Ring Home plan, with tiers ranging from Basic for $5 per month to Premium for $20 per month. You'll also need a plan to store your video event history. Ring was acquired by Amazon in 2018, and now offers a full suite of home security products including outdoor cameras, home alarm systems and more.

          "standfirst": "Amazon may have announced new Echo Show devices recently, but it didn't touch the humble Echo Spot. The smart alarm clock remains the smallest Echo device with a display, but it's one that's really best just for showing the time, weather and other quick bits of information. You can grab one now for only $45 thanks to Prime Day deals; that's 44 percent off its usual price. The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was introduced in July 2024, and this matches its record-low price. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display. What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too. Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the Echo Show 5. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best. Amazon’s Prime Day sale returns on October 7, so you can expect a range of deals on its various Echo devices.

Right now, the Logitech MX Master 4 is available at Best Buy for $90, down from $120. The 25 percent markdown is the first deal we've seen on the device. The MX Master 4 comes three years after its predecessor (and our pick for best wireless mouse of 2025), the MX Master 3S. We tested the latest iteration for a few weeks and it still has all the comfort of the 3S, despite being slightly heftier. Plus, it has a lightly textured plastic on top, rather than the rubber on the 3S. The main difference between the two is the MX Master 4's haptic feedback. It's built into the thumb rest panel and you can change the intensity or turn it off through Logitech’s Options+ software. You'll feel it at times such as when pairing the mouse, the battery is low or you've perfectly lined up a graphic in Photoshop. However, on that note, right now haptics only work with apps like Photoshop, Lightroom and Zoom, with Adobe Premiere Pro coming soon. If you plan to use Photoshop, Lightroom and the like, then buying the mouse from Best Buy is a good choice.

          "standfirst": "October Prime Day is right around the corner, but you can grab some good deals today. Blink security cameras are almost always on sale during Amazon's shopping events, and this time is no different. One of the best deals at the moment is on a duo of Blink Mini 2 cameras, which you can get for only $35. That's half off and a record-low price, not to mention less than what you'd typically pay for one full price. It's also Engadget's pick for the best budget security camera. This budget-friend, wired camera is well-suited for nighttime video: It has a built-in LED spotlight, color night vision and a low-light sensor. Day or night, it records in sharp 1080p resolution. It also has a wider field of view than its predecessor. The Blink Mini 2 is primarily designed for indoor use. But you can use it outdoors, too. You'll just need to fork over $10 for a weather-resistant adapter. Wherever you use the camera, it works with Alexa and supports two-way audio. (\"Hello, doggy, I'll be home soon.\") It also supports person detection. (That's a neat feature that differentiates between people and other types of movement.) However, the feature requires a Blink Subscription Plan. They start at $3 per month or $30 per year for one device. The camera is available in black or white. Both colors are available for the $35 Prime Day deal, but they can't be mixed unless you buy each separately. It's worth noting that this deal is open to anyone — no Prime subscription necessary. Amazon recently announced an upgraded version of this camera that supports 2K video, but it won't be available until later in October. You can also save on a bunch of other Blink (and Ring) security gear for Prime Day. The Blink Outdoor 4 cameras are some of our favorites, and most configurations are on sale for Prime Day, including bundles like this three-camera system that's 61 percent off.

          "standfirst": "The story of the Rabbit R1 is a cautionary tale. The AI gadget stole CES 2024, thanks in large part to its cutesy design and Rabbit's promise that it could do nearly everything a smartphone could without being a distraction. At least that was the pitch. When it finally arrived a few months later, with buggy software and a laundry list of features that simply didn't work, the backlash was swift. Engadget's Devindra Hardawar called the R1 \"a $199 AI toy that fails at almost everything.\" In a video with nearly 9 million views, YouTuber Marques Brownlee said the R1 was barely reviewable. That same backlash extended to Humane, Rabbit's one-time rival, which this past February effectively went out of business after selling its intellectual property to HP for $116 million and discontinuing support for the much-maligned AI Pin. Nearly two years later, Rabbit is still here, having recently released its most significant software update yet with RabbitOS 2. \"We want to take this opportunity to ask people for a second chance,\" Jesse Lyu, the CEO of Rabbit.Having used the R1 in its original state, RabbitOS 2 is a significant improvement. At launch, the touchscreen didn't work like it does on a smartphone. This made doing something simple like accessing the settings menu an absolute chore. With OS 2, Rabbit has redesigned the device's interface around colorful cards, making it much easier to see what it can actually do. The display now finally functions like a regular touchscreen, allowing you to navigate the interface with taps and swipes, instead of a complicated series of presses involving the side button. Other quality of life tweaks also make the device feel more useful. For example, the R1 can now transcribe voice memos without an internet connection. Then there's the update's marquee feature: Creations. Creations are an evolution of Teach mode, a tool Rabbit introduced toward the end of last year. They allow you to vibe code your own apps to use with the R1. The process of making Creations feels a lot less clunky than it did with Teach mode. To start, you describe the app you want R1 to create, then your device will ask a series of clarifying questions to get a better idea of what you want. Intern, the AI agent that handles coding the apps, has a comprehensive knowledge of R1's hardware, so there's no need to get bogged down in technical details. With Lyu's help, I made a tuning app for my guitar. The entire process took about five minutes, and the result, I'll admit, felt novel in a way I hadn't experienced in a while. The tuner not only worked, but I was able to tell the coding agent exactly how I wanted it to look and function, with the AI offering helpful suggestions to guide the process. Did I want the app to use a needle interface? Yes, I said. What color should the interface be? The R1's signature orange, I told it. Granted, there are countless tuning apps out there, but it felt cool that I had some hand in deciding how this one should look and work. I also appreciate some of the Creations others have made. There's one that offers an interactive map of Hollow Knight: Silksong's Pharloom that has been my companion through the latter parts of the game. As far as Lyu is concerned, Creations are the killer feature the R1 has been missing since launch, offering something no smartphone on the market can quite yet match. He's particularly excited about the system Rabbit has devised for distributing them. There's no traditional app store like you might find on an Android or iOS device; instead, users can share their apps through Rabbithole (Rabbit's online R1 hub) or using a QR code. Still, Lyu admits there are things Rabbit needs to figure out before it can convince people to throw out their phones. \"The biggest barrier [to R1 adoption] is no one wants to carry around two devices. We know that, and there are a lot of things on the phone, whether you're using an iPhone or Android, that users don't trust an AI to handle,\" he said. Here, Lyu is primarily thinking of banking apps. Banking regulation being what it is, there's probably no future where you'll be able to vibe code an app to access your Chase account, but Lyu is hopeful consumer demand will eventually lead to financial institutions embracing Rabbit and the R1. Either way, he's adamant that Creations are the way forward for the company. \"This is still the right thing for us to do,\" he tells me. \"If you look at how you built your tuner app versus how somebody would build and sell their tuner app on the App Store, that's a completely different generational experience. You did zero coding. You just talk to your R1 and distribute.\" I wonder if that's enough. The ability to create your own apps will be compelling to some people, but I imagine most just want software that works without the hassle of making it themselves. Besides, there's more to software development than just putting an app out into the world. Arguably the more difficult (and important) part of the job is maintaining an app, ensuring it works for you and other people. AI systems are getting better at coding every day, but they still make mistakes, and having some coding knowledge makes it a lot easier to fix those errors. Some smartphone experiences will also be harder to replicate than others. One Creation allows you to stream music to the R1 from YouTube Music, but the software is so basic compared to the official app on Android and iOS. Rabbit has shared documentation on GitHub to help program Creations that can access other third-party services, but I wonder how quickly people will lose interest in vibe coding all but the most basic apps. And for all its faults, the app store model offers a way for developers to earn a living off their work. People can upload their Creations to Rabbit's website, but the only party making money on the concept is Rabbit — at the moment there's no infrastructure in place to charge money for Creations, assuming anyone would want to. Creations also consume Intern tasks, and those aren't exactly cheap. You can buy three for $30 or pay $70 per month for a monthly allowance of 30. Of course, the question most people have is the same one that has dogged Rabbit and the R1 from the start: \"Why can't this just be an app?\" Lyu contends Creations are one part of the answer. \"I don't think we're going to see an iPhone-like moment this year or next year. Starting in 2027, that's when the generational shift will happen. In that sense, we're not in a rush to do something major.\" When I asked why 2027, Rabbit declined to share more, but something Lyu said about the prospect of competing against OpenAI gave me a hint of the company's plans. If you need a refresher, OpenAI announced in May it was buying former Apple design chief Jony Ive's hardware startup for $6.5 billion, with the ambition of releasing its own AI device. \"From what I know about Jony and OpenAI, I don't think they're going to be interested in a second gadget like R1,\" Lyu said (he knows Sam Altman personally, having gone through Y-Combination when Altman was president of the startup accelerator from 2014 to 2019). \"I think they're going to focus on a phone-like factor. That's a much bigger audience. But by 2027, everyone is going to be making phones.\" When I later asked if a phone was in Rabbit's future, a company spokesperson declined to elaborate on Lyu's comments. \"We’ve been working on many different prototypes and form factors, but don’t have any specific details to share.\" For now, the company appears to be squarely focused on improving its software. \"The focus this year is on rebirth,\" Lyu told me. \"And to keep pioneering things no else is doing in the industry.\" The challenge for Rabbit will not only be staying ahead of OpenAI, but all the existing phone manufacturers adding AI features to their devices. Just earlier this week, Nothing, a smaller player in the space, announced Essential Apps, a tool people can use to vibe code apps for the company's phones. If Nothing is successful, how long will it be before Samsung and Google do the same?This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-plots-its-redemption-arc-120000271.html?src=rss",

But by 2027, everyone is going to be making phones.\" When I later asked if a phone was in Rabbit's future, a company spokesperson declined to elaborate on Lyu's comments. \"We’ve been working on many different prototypes and form factors, but don’t have any specific details to share.\" For now, the company appears to be squarely focused on improving its software. \"The focus this year is on rebirth,\" Lyu told me. \"And to keep pioneering things no else is doing in the industry.\" The challenge for Rabbit will not only be staying ahead of OpenAI, but all the existing phone manufacturers adding AI features to their devices. Just earlier this week, Nothing, a smaller player in the space, announced Essential Apps, a tool people can use to vibe code apps for the company's phones. If Nothing is successful, how long will it be before Samsung and Google do the same?This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-plots-its-redemption-arc-120000271.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A good webcam makes a big difference whether you’re jumping on work calls, streaming gameplay or catching up with friends across the country. Built-in laptop cameras often fall short, so investing in one of the best webcams gives you sharper video, better colors and features like background control or low-light correction.The market is full of options at different prices, which makes picking the right one tricky. Some focus on 4K resolution while others prioritize smooth frame rates or strong microphones. This guide rounds up the best webcams you can buy right now so you can find one that matches your setup and needs. Table of contents Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam How we test webcams Other webcams we tested Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam Resolution and field of view While some newer computers have 1080p webcams, most built-in cameras have a resolution of 720p, so you’ll want to look for an external webcam that has a higher resolution. FHD webcams will give you better video quality; ideally, you’re looking for something that can handle 1080p at 60fps or 30fps. If you’re considering a cheap 720p webcam, make sure to get one that supports at least 30fps (most will) or, even better, 60fps. However, if your primary concern is better picture quality during video calls, 1080p is the way to go. Some webcams can shoot in 4K, but that’s overkill for most people. Not to mention most video conferencing services like Zoom, Google Meet and Skype don’t even support 4K video. When it comes to streaming, Twitch maxes out at 1080p video, but YouTube added 4K live streaming back in 2016. Ultimately, with 4K webcam shots having such limited use, most people can get by with a solid 1080p camera. Field of view (FOV) controls how much can fit in the frame when you’re recording. Most webcams I tested had a default field of view of around 78 degrees, which captured me and enough of my background to prove that I really need to organize my home office. On cheaper webcams you’ll usually see narrower fields of view (around 60 degrees), and those aren’t necessarily bad. They won’t show as much of your background, but that also means you won’t be able to squeeze as many friends or family members into frame when you’re having Zoom birthday parties. On the flip side, more expensive webcams may let you adjust the field of view to be even wider than average, and some even offer features like digital zoom. Autofocus and other “auto” features Webcams with autofocus will keep the image quality sharp without much work on your part. You should be able to move around, step back and forth, and remain in focus the whole time. Some standalone webcam models let you manually adjust focus, too, if you have specific needs. Devices with fixed focus are less convenient, but they tend to be more affordable. In the same vein is auto framing, a feature that some high-end webcams now offer. Similarly to Apple’s Center Stage feature, the camera automatically adjusts to keep you in the center of the frame even as you move around. This used to be a feature only available on the most premium webcams, but now you can find it on sub-$200 devices. You’ll also see other “auto” features listed in webcam specs, most notably auto light correction. This will adjust the camera’s settings to make up for a dimly lit room. If you don’t have bright lights, or often take calls in places where you can’t control the lighting, this feature will be valuable. Alternatively, you might consider using your mirrorless camera as a high-quality webcam solution, taking all of the benefits and features with you (albeit in a cumbersome package). Microphones Most webcams have built-in microphones that, depending on your setup, might end up being closer to you than your computer’s own mics. Check to see if the model you’re considering has mono or stereo mics, as the latter is better. Some even use noise-reduction technology to keep your voice loud and clear. While audiophiles and streamers will want to invest in a standalone microphone, most others can get by using a webcam’s built-in mic. Design There aren’t a ton of fascinating breakthroughs when it comes to external webcam design. Most are round or rectangular devices that clip onto a monitor or your laptop screen. Some have the ability to swivel or screw onto a tripod stand and others can simply sit on your desk beside your computer. But unless you really like having people stare up your nose, the latter isn’t ideal. We recommend clipping your webcam to your monitor and ensuring that it’s at or slightly above eye level. A few webcams go above and beyond by adding hardware extras like built-in lights and lens covers, too. The former can help you stand out in a dark room, while the latter makes it so hackers can’t view you through your webcam without your knowledge. Price Most external webcams that are just good enough to be a step up from your computer’s built-in camera cost between $60 and $150. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use. Spending $150 or more means you might get advanced features that tend to be present in a pro webcam like 4K resolution, vertical and horizontal recording options, stereo mics, customizable video settings and more. But unless you’re spending hours on video calls each day or streaming multiple times each week, you can settle on a budget webcam and safely skip most of those high-end options. How we test webcams We primarily test webcams by putting them through as much real-world use as possible. We examine their design, how flexible they are and how easy they are to reposition, and make note of how heavy they are and if that affects their ability to stay put while sitting on top of a screen. We use each webcam for at least a week straight as our primary camera for all video chats, and we make sure to use the device in different lighting environments to test low-light performance. We also use any built-in microphones as our primary audio inputs on video calls as well. Finally, although most of these webcams are plug-and-play, we test out any proprietary software that’s intended to work with each webcam, tweaking things like field of view, video resolution and effects, and using any special features like Show Mode on Logitech webcams. Others webcams we tested Logitech C920s Pro HD Our previous top pick, the Logitech C920s Pro HD webcam remains a solid option for those with less than $100 to spend and really only need a basic 1080p camera to upgrade their setup, or something affordable to make them look better on those inevitable Zoom calls. It has a 78-degree field of view, decent microphones and handy privacy shutter built in. The Brio 500 took the top spot away from this model thanks to its advanced light correction, auto-framing and Show Mode. Webcam FAQs Should I get a 4K or 1080p webcam? It depends on how you plan to use it. A 1080p webcam is more than enough for most video calls, online classes and casual streaming. The picture looks clear, loads quickly and works well even on slower internet connections. A 4K webcam makes sense if you want sharper detail, especially for content creation, professional streaming or recordings you plan to upload. The extra resolution also helps if you crop or zoom in during a call without losing much quality. Keep in mind that 4K requires more bandwidth and not every platform supports it, so think about whether your setup and audience will benefit before spending more.

          "standfirst": "When I write about the cognitive migration now underway, brought about by the rapid advance of gen AI, I do so from the perspective of someone who has spent four decades in the technology industry. My own journey runs from coding business applications in Fortran and COBOL to systems analysis and design, IT project management, enterprise systems consulting, computing hardware sales and technology industry communications. All of it has been centered in the U.S., although I have collaborated with colleagues and clients across Europe and Asia.My writing carries an American, tech-industry vantage point, although I make attempts to see a broader perspective. Perhaps that is fitting, since much of the frontier development of AI remains clustered in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and a handful of other Western hubs. But how does this migration look beyond America’s borders? For millions in the Global South, cognitive migration is less about the loss of white-collar prestige and more about the chance to leapfrog into new opportunities.This divide is visible in the data. The 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer found that fewer than one in three Americans feel comfortable with businesses using AI, while in India, Indonesia and Nigeria nearly two-thirds express comfort. In the West, AI may be perceived to threaten job loss and displacement, and this view may be warranted. A study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that 60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to the impact of AI due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. The Wall Street Journal quoted Ford CEO Jim Farley: “AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind.”In the Global South, however, AI is often perceived as an opportunity to improve education, strengthen healthcare, modernize agriculture and drive development. One analysis argues that for the Global South, “AI holds tangible promise for nations historically excluded from the benefits of previous industrial revolutions.” Perhaps this explains the findings reported by Academia.edu that Global North newspapers publish more negative AI headlines, while Global South outlets emphasize opportunity. Yet the story is not so simple. Even where the potential for advancement is emphasized, there is often also worry about loss of work, ethics, algorithmic bias, access and technical capacity. As with earlier waves of globalization, gains and risks will be distributed unevenly.AI as opportunityThere is a strong positive narrative around AI in the Global South, with many hopeful stories and promising results. In Nigeria, a World Bank-funded after-school tutoring program that used AI to tailor lessons to individual students produced striking results with nearly two years of learning gains in just six weeks. For communities with few qualified teachers, such gains are not incremental improvements. They can transform futures. Healthcare applications provide comparable stories. In India, Boston Consulting Group reports that AI diagnostic tools are being deployed in rural clinics with few doctors, offering screenings for conditions such as breast cancer or tuberculosis that might otherwise go undetected. These tools extend the reach of limited health resources and help detect conditions before it is too late.The use of AI in agriculture also shows promise. In Kenya, the PlantVillage Nuru app developed with Penn State University uses AI to detect crop diseases through farmers’ smartphones, equipping them to spot and treat threats to their harvests early. For households that depend on subsistence farming, such tools can mean the difference between security and scarcity.Yet many of these breakthroughs rely on Northern institutions, creating benefits but also exposing a fragile dependency. When outside funding or partnerships end, local efforts can stall. In this sense, leapfrogging risks being built on borrowed foundations.Taken together, these examples illustrate why many in the Global South see AI as a chance to transform trajectories rather than repeat old patterns. Yet optimism tells only part of the story. Alongside these gains are deep structural challenges that complicate the journey, reminding us that this migration, like all others, carries benefits that include hidden costs.Barriers to progressResearch also shows that AI adoption across the Global South is hindered by persistent gaps in infrastructure, data, skills and governance. Availability of reliable electricity and broadband remains uneven, local datasets are often scarce or biased and many countries face shortages of trained professionals to develop and oversee AI systems. Without strong regulatory frameworks, societies are also more exposed to privacy risks, exploitative labor practices and algorithmic bias. These realities mean that while AI holds promise as a development pathway, it can also deepen inequality if its benefits concentrate in urban centers and among elites, while leaving rural communities behind.So why do surveys of trust show higher comfort with AI in the Global South than in the West? One explanation lies in expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, AI is often perceived as a threat to stable jobs and established professions. In Nigeria, India or Indonesia, by contrast, it is more likely to be framed as a tool for closing persistent gaps. Media narratives often reinforce the divergence in expectations. In the West, headlines emphasize automation anxiety, while in the Global South, AI is more often described as a development pathway. Add to this the fact that many people in the Global South report higher levels of trust in institutions overall, and the disparity begins to make sense. The same technology intersects with different baselines, diverse needs, distinct cultures and different stories, which shape whether AI is welcomed with suspicion or with hope. Yet beyond these perceptual differences lie material realities that complicate the optimistic narrative, particularly in how global AI development distributes both its benefits and its burdens.Hidden costsEvery migration carries costs alongside gains, and the story of AI in the Global South is no different. While the overall AI narrative in the Global South leans positive, many celebrated breakthroughs depend on large workforces doing essential yet hidden tasks. Data annotation and content review are indispensable to the global AI economy, but the work is repetitive, emotionally taxing and poorly paid relative to the value it creates.Other sectors face pressure from a different direction. In India and the Philippines, business process outsourcing and call centers employ millions of workers who support global clients. These roles depend on language, routine cognitive tasks and customer service, the very areas where AI chatbots and automated platforms are advancing fastest.The shift is not immediate, but workers in these industries are already questioning whether the migration now underway will carry them forward or leave them behind. Is cognitive migration a single global phenomenon, or are we witnessing multiple migrations that only appear connected?Many routes, shared destinationIs this the same cognitive migration unfolding everywhere, or are there separate journeys? On the surface, the story looks divided. In the U.S. and Europe, professionals worry about displacement from stable careers and a risk to their lifestyles. In India, Nigeria and Indonesia, AI is often presented as a chance to accelerate development and fill long-standing gaps. These appear to be distinct migrations.Yet, the reality is more entangled. The story of AI in the Global South is not simply one of catching up, just as the story in the West is not simply one of decline. Migration is never only progress or only loss. It is both, with something gained and something given up. For teachers in Nigeria, the gain may be students advancing at unprecedented speed. For call center workers in India, the loss may be jobs once thought secure. For farmers in Kenya, the gain may be healthier crops and steadier harvests. For professionals in Europe or the United States, the loss may be careers reshaped or diminished by automation.This variability in experience is not because AI technology is somehow different in one area or another, but because the lived experiences are diverse. The same systems can seem empowering in one place and threatening in another. An uneven passageWhat lies ahead is still uncertain. But if migration teaches anything, it is that adaptation requires not only resilience but imagination. The task is not to deny what is lost or to celebrate only what is gained, but to recognize both and design wisely for what comes next.This migration is not unfolding along a single path. It is fractured and revealing. The starting points differ, the routes are uneven, and the burdens are not equally shared. In the Global South, AI is often seen as a lever for progress, not a threat to status. But beneath the promise lie the same risks we face everywhere, including extraction without investment, automation without inclusion, innovation without safeguards and deployment without trust. These are not side effects. They are signals. If we ignore them, the cognitive future will be one more story written by the few for the few. As Indonesian policy advisor Tuhu Nugraha has argued in Modern Diplomacy: “As concerns rise globally about AI’s unchecked development potentially destabilizing economies or social cohesion, models from the Global South that emphasize inclusion, trust and reflection can help mitigate those risks before they explode into global backlash.” His warning reinforces the point that inclusion and trust must be part of the design of AI advancement and not assumed.If we pay attention, the Global South may offer not just caution but clarity. The choice is not only whether to design wisely, but whose experience we treat as essential when we do. Because in the end, cognitive migration is not regional. It is a worldwide passage, and how we navigate it together will shape not just the future of AI, but the future of being human.Gary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman.",

The task is not to deny what is lost or to celebrate only what is gained, but to recognize both and design wisely for what comes next.This migration is not unfolding along a single path. It is fractured and revealing. The starting points differ, the routes are uneven, and the burdens are not equally shared. In the Global South, AI is often seen as a lever for progress, not a threat to status. But beneath the promise lie the same risks we face everywhere, including extraction without investment, automation without inclusion, innovation without safeguards and deployment without trust. These are not side effects. They are signals. If we ignore them, the cognitive future will be one more story written by the few for the few. As Indonesian policy advisor Tuhu Nugraha has argued in Modern Diplomacy: “As concerns rise globally about AI’s unchecked development potentially destabilizing economies or social cohesion, models from the Global South that emphasize inclusion, trust and reflection can help mitigate those risks before they explode into global backlash.” His warning reinforces the point that inclusion and trust must be part of the design of AI advancement and not assumed.If we pay attention, the Global South may offer not just caution but clarity. The choice is not only whether to design wisely, but whose experience we treat as essential when we do. Because in the end, cognitive migration is not regional. It is a worldwide passage, and how we navigate it together will shape not just the future of AI, but the future of being human.Gary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman.",

          "standfirst": "Vlogging used to be a niche camera category, but it’s now at least equal to (if not dominating) the photo scene. All the major camera companies now have multiple creator models with new ones arriving nearly every month, including Nikon’s awesome new ZR hybrid creator camera built in collaboration with cinema company RED.Other recent creator models include Sony's powerful full-frame ZV-E1, the Insta360 X5 and Fujifilm’s X-M5. Some cameras in this guide, like the new Panasonic S1 II and Panasonic’s GH7, are hybrid mirrorless cameras with vlogging powers as part of a greater toolkit.All have certain things in common, however, like flip-around screens, eye-detect autofocus and some kind of stabilization. Prices, features and quality can vary widely, though. To that end, we’ve updated our guide with all the latest vlogging cameras designed for novice to professional creators with a wide range of budgets. Engadget has tested all of these to give you the best possible recommendations. Table of contents Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Upcoming cameras What to look for in a vlogging camera Best vlogging cameras for 2025 Best action and portable cameras If you’re just starting out in vlogging or need a small, rugged camera, an action cam might be your best bet. In general, they’re easy to use as you don’t have to worry about things like exposure or focus. Recent models also offer good electronic stabilization and sharp, colorful video at up to 4K and 60 fps. The downsides are a lack of control, image quality that’s not on par with larger cameras and no zooming or option to change lenses. Best compact vlogging cameras Compact cameras are a step up from smartphones or action cameras, with larger sensors and much better image quality. At the same time, they’re not quite as versatile as mirrorless or DSLR cameras (and not necessarily cheaper) and they lack advanced options like 10-bit video. For folks who want the best possible quality without needing to think too much about their camera, however, they’re the best option. Best mirrorless vlogging cameras This is the class that has changed the most over the past couple of years, particularly in the more affordable price categories. Interchangeable lens cameras give you the most options for vlogging, offering larger sensors than compact cameras with better low-light sensitivity and shallower depth of field to isolate you or your subject. They also offer better control of your image with manual controls, log recording, 10-bit video and more. The drawbacks are extra weight compared to action or compact cameras, extra complexity and higher prices. Upcoming cameras Nikon ZR Nikon’s ZR has just arrived and I haven’t been able to test the final version yet, but it’s loaded with potential. Developed in collaboration with the cinema company RED that it acquired last year, it offers 6K RAW video at up to 60 fps using RED’s new R3D NE format along with its Log3G10 color science. It has in-body stabilization with up to 7.5 stops of shake reduction, hybrid phase-detect autofocus and a huge 4-inch display with a superb 3,070 dot resolution and 1,000 nits of brightness. That’s all squeezed into a compact 540 gram (1.2 pound) body. Best of all, it costs just $2,200, making it not only more capable but much cheaper than many comparable cinema cameras. What to look for in a vlogging camera Vlogging cameras are perfect if you often work alone and either use a tripod, gimbal, vehicle mount or just your hands to hold a camera. It has to be good not just for filming yourself, but other “B-roll” footage that helps tell your story. The number one requirement is a flip-around screen so you can see yourself while filming. Those can rotate up, down or to the side, but flipping out to the side is preferable so a tripod or microphone won’t block it. Continuous autofocus (AF) for video with face and eye detection is also a must. It becomes your camera “assistant,” keeping things in focus while you concentrate on your content. Most cameras can do that nowadays, but some still do it better than others. If you move around or walk a lot, you should look for a camera with in-body stabilization. Electronic stabilization is another option as long as you’re aware of the limitations. If budget permits, it’s good to have a camera with a fast sensor that limits rolling shutter, which can create a distracting jello “wobble” with quick camera movements. Steve Dent/Engadget 4K recording is another key feature. All cameras nowadays can shoot 4K up to at least 24 fps, but if possible, it’s better to have 4K at 60 or even 120 fps. If you shoot sports or other things involving fast movement, look for a model with at least 1080p at 120 fps for slow-motion recording. Video quality and color accuracy are other important considerations, especially for skin tones. Good light sensitivity helps for shooting concerts or filming at night, and a log profile helps improve dynamic range in very bright or dark shooting conditions. If you want the best possible image quality and can afford it, get a camera that can record 4K with 10-bits (billions) of colors and log capture to boost dynamic range. That will give you more options when you go to edit. Don’t neglect audio either — it’s just as important as video. Look for a camera with a microphone port so you can plug in a shotgun or lapel mic for interviews, or at least one with a good-quality built-in microphone. It’s also nice to have a headphone port to monitor sound to confirm that levels are good and there’s no clipping or other issues. You’ll also want good battery life and, if possible, dual memory card slots for a backup. Finally, don’t forget about your camera’s size and weight. If you’re constantly carrying one while shooting, especially at the end of a gimbal or gorillapod, it might actually be the most important factor. That’s why tiny GoPro cameras are so popular for sports, despite offering lower image quality and fewer pro features.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-vlogging-camera-151603452.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Presented by DXC TechnologyThe sheer volume and sophistication of incoming threats today has dwarfed attacks from just six months ago, let alone two years ago, because adversaries have leveled up with AI. Naturally, security operations and analysts are under pressure, facing mounting alert volumes and false positives, while organizations scramble to support them amidst a widening talent gap and an old model that doesn&#x27;t stand up, says Chris Drumgoole, president, global infrastructure services at DXC Technology.\"The traditional, linear SOC [Security Operations Center] method was built very much like the rest of information technology service management — ticket, investigate threat — but the math just doesn’t add up given the volume,\" Drumgoole says. \"You would need a SOC bigger than your customer call center just to deal with all the incoming tickets. And that pure volume question is coupled with the increasing sophistication of tools and attacks. When you put those things in a blender, you end up with an old model that doesn’t work anymore.\"To combat alert fatigue and slow investigation cycles, organizations are fighting fire with fire: agentic security, or intelligent AI agents, that are capable of independently triaging, investigating, and responding to incidents at scale. DXC has partnered with 7AI to launch DXC Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC) integrating fully autonomous AI agents into its end-to-end managed security operations. But before rolling this out globally to customers, DXC put the technology to the test, Drumgoole adds, using 7AI&#x27;s agentic platform to optimize its own internal SOC capabilities. They immediately saw an 80% reduction in tier-1 SOC analyst time and a 95% reduction in the number of tickets that humans must analyze, which means a 67% reduction in mean time to respond in the tier-1 and tier-2 SOC. A category shift, not an incremental update This isn&#x27;t just upgraded automation, but a major shift in threat response, analogous to the earlier shift from static defense to dynamic response. Agentic security isn&#x27;t rule-based — it&#x27;s adaptive, contextual, and end-to-end. And though humans will stay in the loop over the long term, agentic AI has the potential to move from reactive triage to proactive, self-directed defense.\"The real difference is that the AI model gives every alert the side eye, so to speak,\" Drumgoole says. \"While automation responds to the same alert the same way every time, the AI agent approaches each situation uniquely, recognizes the nuances and can learn from what it saw the last time and the time before. What we expect from our new Agentic SOC is going to be evolutionarily different just in terms of the amount they handle and how fast they handle it going forward.\"DXC Agentic SOC eliminates the traditional bottlenecks of manual alert processing, expecting to save customers 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per investigation by reducing false positive rates that can consume analyst resources. Average response time has gone from about 74 minutes to 24 minutes, a 70% improvement over the average human capability. \"The data speaks for itself. The math is the math,\" Drumgoole says. \"In the first 40 days of running our own Agentic SOC, we saved 165 human days of analyst work time. It’s only going up from there.An evolve-or-die momentEven though the math speaks for itself in terms of accuracy, many organizations are still nervous about AI in general, and in particular, relying on it to transform their processes. Most workflows are built around humans, and bringing AI into the mix means disrupting that workflow, which adds time and material costs, and even takes an emotional toll. \"That’s a big adjustment for people,\" Drumgoole says. \"It’s really not a technical barrier, but an emotional, operational, and process barrier, underlined by &#x27;this is the way we’ve always done it&#x27; thinking.\"But according to Drumgoole, it’s an evolve-or-die moment, and organizations need to push through the uncertainty. The mandate has to come from the top level, with executive-level sponsorship and clear mission. The beauty of the solution is that it&#x27;s straightforward to implement and easy to scale, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be considered a technology transformation, necessarily. Instead, it should be treated as equivalent to adding a stable of tier-1 security analysts. It doesn&#x27;t require data storage or access to personal information, just needs to have the same security and access controls that an analyst would.\"Those who embrace it will grow their business,\" he explains. \"The more you can invest in training your agents, in building and deploying them, the better they’re going to get.

The best deals include the laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W), which is 20 percent off and down to $184 when you clip the on-page coupon on its Amazon page. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs — the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger — which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously — also gets a 20 percent discount to $184 when you use a clippable coupon. While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is 20 percent off too, at $120 with a clippable coupon. Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.

The E Ink tablet with 16GB of storage is $100 off, down from $400 to $300, which is a record-low price. If you want more storage, the 32GB and 64GB versions are also 25 and 24 percent off, respectively. The Kindle Scribe is our pick for best e-reader E Ink tablet. It scored an 86 in our review, thanks to the smooth reading and writing experience it provides. We were also fans of its sleek and slender design.

It's worth noting that Amazon announced a few new Kindle Scribe models recently, but none of them are available just yet. The Kindle Scribe 3 has a thinner and lighter design, plus faster page-turning and writing experiences. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon's first full-color E Ink tablet.

The E Ink tablet with 16GB of storage is $100 off, down from $400 to $300, which is a record-low price. If you want more storage, the 32GB and 64GB versions are also 25 and 24 percent off, respectively. The Kindle Scribe is our pick for best e-reader E Ink tablet. It scored an 86 in our review, thanks to the smooth reading and writing experience it provides. We were also fans of its sleek and slender design.

You'll need to be a Prime member to take advantage of the offer on the Shark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum, but if you are, you can get the device for over half off. The discount drops the price from $550 to $230. That means you can snap up the robot vacuum for $320 below list price. The discount marks a record low for this model. Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums. There are small variations between them, and a different model is our pick for the best robot vacuum for most people. In general, you can expect solid cleaning performance from these devices, along with accurate home mapping and an easy-to-use app. The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration. If you'd rather plump for a model that's able to mop your floors too, you're in luck: a Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 vacuum is on sale as well. At $300 for Prime members, this vacuum is available for $400 (or 57 percent) off the list price. Its mopping function can scrub hard floors 100 times per minute. You can also trigger the Matrix Mop function in the app for a deeper clean. This delivers 50 percent better stain cleaning in targeted zones, according to Shark.

Strangely enough, there are some solid deals on several Apple Watch models right now ahead of Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event. The second-gen Apple Watch SE with LTE connectivity has dropped to $189, which is a discount of $110 or 37 percent. That's a new record low price for this 40mm variant with a small/medium band. The discount applies to versions with an ink sport loop and denim sport band. It's worth bearing in mind that this deal is for the previous-gen model, which Apple released in 2022. The company started shipping the latest Apple Watch SE in September. That starts at $240 for a GPS and Wi-Fi model without LTE connectivity. The third-gen SE 3 is now our pick for the best budget Apple Watch. However, if you're looking for a cheaper option for fitness tracking, at-a-glance notifications and, perhaps, quick access to a calendar, the second-gen SE is worth considering. Several variants of the Apple Watch Series 10 are on sale on Amazon as well. This is last year's version of the smartwatch, but it's still plenty capable and it supports some of the same new features as the Series 11, such as sleep apnea detection and sleep scoring. You can pick one up for as little as $329.

Thanks to Prime Day deals that you can already get now, you can get one of our favorite Roku streaming devices for less than $30. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is on sale for just $24 right now, which is 40 percent off and the lowest price we've seen. We picked the Streaming Stick Plus as the best streaming device for free and live content, thanks in large part to The Roku Channel app that accompanies it. The Roku Channel features over 500 free TV channels with live news, sports coverage and a rotating lineup of TV shows and movies. In our hands-on review of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, we thought it was perfect for travel thanks to its small size and the fact that it can be powered by your TV's USB port, nixing the need for a wall adapter. Menu navigation and opening or closing apps won't happen at quite the same speeds as more expensive streamers, but it's quick enough for what is ultimately a pretty low-cost option. The Wi-Fi range on this one is also weaker than Roku's pricier devices, but unless you are placing it exceedingly far from your router, it shouldn't be an issue. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus supports both HD and 4K TVs, as well as HDR10+ content. It doesn't support Dolby Vision, however; for that you'll need to upgrade to Roku's Streaming Stick 4K or Roku Ultra. It comes with Roku's rechargeable voice remote with push-to-talk voice controls. Roku's remote can also turn on your TV and adjust the volume while you're watching. If you've been thinking about getting a Roku device, or you already love the platform and want a compact and convenient way to take it with you when you travel, then this sale provides a great opportunity. If you'd prefer a more powerful and slightly more stationary device, the Roku Ultra is on sale for $69 right now, too.

          "standfirst": "In the race to automate everything – from customer service to code – AI is being heralded as a silver bullet. The narrative is seductive: AI tools that can write entire applications, streamline engineering teams and reduce the need for expensive human developers, along with hundreds of other jobs. But from my point of view as a technologist who spends every day inside real companies’ data and workflows, the hype doesn’t match up with the reality. I’ve worked with industry leaders like General Electric, The Walt Disney Company and Harvard Medical School to optimize their data and AI infrastructure, and here’s what I’ve learned: Replacing humans with AI in most jobs is still just an idea on the horizon. I worry that we&#x27;re thinking too far ahead. In the past two years, more than a quarter of programming jobs have vanished. Mark Zuckerberg announced he is planning to replace many of Meta’s coders with AI. But, intriguingly, both Bill Gates and Sam Altman have publicly warned against replacing coders. Right now, we shouldn’t count on AI tools to successfully replace jobs in tech or business. That’s because what AI knows is inherently limited by what it has seen – and most of what it has seen in the tech world is boilerplate.Generative AI models are trained on large datasets, which typically fall into two main categories: publicly available data (from the open internet), or proprietary or licensed data (created in-house by the organization, or purchased from third parties). Simple tasks, like building a basic website or configuring a template app, are easy wins for generative models. But when it comes to writing the sophisticated, proprietary infrastructure code that powers companies like Google or Stripe, there’s a problem: That code doesn’t exist in public repositories. It’s locked away inside the walls of corporations, inaccessible to training data and often written by engineers with decades of experience.Right now, AI can’t reason on its own yet. And it doesn’t have instincts. It’s just mimicking patterns. A friend of mine in the tech world once described large language models (LLMs) as a \"really good guesser.\" Think of AI today as a junior team member — helpful for a first draft or simple projects. But like any junior, it requires oversight. In programming, for example, while I’ve found a 5X improvement for simple coding, I’ve found that reviewing and correcting more complicated AI-produced code often takes more time and energy than writing the code myself. You still need senior professionals with deep experience to find the flaws, and to understand the nuances of how those flaws might pose a risk six months from now. That’s not to say AI shouldn’t have a place in the workplace. But the dream of replacing entire teams of programmers or accountants or marketers with one human and a host of AI tools is far premature. We still need senior-level people in these jobs, and we need to train people in junior-level jobs to be technically capable enough to assume the more complex roles one day. The goal of AI in tech and business shouldn’t be about removing humans from the loop. I’m not saying this because I’m scared AI will take my job. I’m saying it because I’ve seen how dangerous trusting AI too much at this stage can be. Business leaders, no matter what industry they’re in, should be aware: While AI promises cost savings and smaller teams, these efficiency gains could backfire. You might trust AI to perform more junior levels of work, but not to complete more sophisticated projects. AI is fast. Humans are smart. There’s a big difference.

          "content": "Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their collective work in the discovery of specialized immune cells that roam the body and keep potentially harmful immune responses in check—preventing them from attacking the body directly (autoimmune responses) or causing harm with overzealous responses to invaders. Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok. Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.Read full article Comments",

The SDK is built on the open source Model Context Protocol (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added. The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.Read full article Comments",

Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University. What the brain “knows” Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the Kanizsa triangle: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.

At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1. Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K. As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that electromagnetic interference from an underground train line caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams remained worried about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. For the record, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "In 1915, intrepid British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew were stranded for months in the Antarctic after their ship, Endurance, was trapped by pack ice, eventually sinking into the freezing depths of the Weddell Sea. Miraculously, the entire crew survived. The prevailing popular narrative surrounding the famous voyage features two key assumptions: that Endurance was the strongest polar ship of its time, and that the ship ultimately sank after ice tore away the rudder. However, a fresh analysis reveals that Endurance would have sunk even with an intact rudder; it was crushed by the cumulative compressive forces of the Antarctic ice with no single cause for the sinking. Furthermore, the ship wasn't designed to withstand those forces, and Shackleton was likely well aware of that fact, according to a new paper published in the journal Polar Record. Yet he chose to embark on the risky voyage anyway. Author Jukka Tuhkuri of Aalto University is a polar explorer and one of the leading researchers on ice worldwide. He was among the scientists on the Endurance22 mission that discovered the Endurance shipwreck in 2022, documented in a 2024 National Geographic documentary. The ship was in pristine condition partly because of the lack of wood-eating microbes in those waters. In fact, the Endurance22 expedition's exploration director, Mensun Bound, told The New York Times at the time that the shipwreck was the finest example he's ever seen; Endurance was \"in a brilliant state of preservation.\"Read full article Comments",
