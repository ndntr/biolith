          "standfirst": "If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show, The Voice, and Sunday Night Football. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's NBA coverage on NBC, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch the NBA without Fubo This week's nationally televised NBA on NBC matchup between the Knicks vs. Celtics is on Tuesday, Dec. 2. As an alternative, you can tune in on platforms like Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Additionally, there are several games that are available on NBC in local markets that are available on platforms like DirecTV and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's NBA games, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like the Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, Stumble, and Happy's Place. On Bravo, there are new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Southern Charm, and the season premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, on Dec. 5, too. Which channels are no longer available on Fubo? The following is a list of channels owned or operated by NBC that are not currently available on Fubo: Local Channels: NBC Local Affiliates Telemundo Local/National Regional Sports Channels: NBC Sports 4K NBC Sports Bay Area NBC Sports Bay Area Plus NBC Sports Boston NBC Sports California NBC Sports California Plus NBC Sports California Plus 3 NBC Sports Philadelphia NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus National Channels: American Crimes Bravo Bravo Vault Caso Cerrado CNBC CNBC World Cozi Dateline 24/7 E!

Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. When will the missing channels return? There is no information available as to when NBC's lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing. Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, \"If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account.\" At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle. What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime? Looking to switch from Fubo? You've got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices: Watch NBC on Peacock Get a deal on Peacock with Walmart+ Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month Try Hulu + Live TV for free Other services to watch NBC If I switch to a different service, can I cancel or pause Fubo in the meantime? Fubo does not allow customers to pause their subscriptions, so if you're looking to make a change, you can cancel your plan outright.

          "standfirst": "Android 16 first came out in June but, in a change from its usual yearly update schedule, a second iteration is now on the way. Android has announced new features ranging from AI-powered notification summaries to built-in parental controls. As usual, the update will roll out to eligible Pixel devices first. Anyone who has used Apple Intelligence, will find some of these Android 16 features familiar. Such is the case for new notification tools, like AI-powered message summaries and a notification organizer. Other updates also align with existing Apple tools like built-in parental controls, for things like screen time and app usage. Android 16's second release has additional new features, including custom icon shapes, themed icons and an expanded dark theme. The company claims the latter should improve battery life. Outside of Android 16's second go around, the company is also rolling out a series of general updates. There's Circle To Search, which uses an AI Overview to find out if a message is likely to be spam — and gives advice on next steps. Similarly, Google Messages will now send an alert any time an unknown number sends a group invite. It will offer a one-tap option to leave, block and report. In what could be helpful or get annoying really fast, Android is beta testing something titled Call Reason. It allows Android users to mark their call as \"urgent\" when calling a saved contact. It will not only show as urgent on the call screen, but keeps the note if they miss the call. Pinned Tabs are also now available on Chrome for Android, staying saved and upfront, just like in Chrome on desktop. Plus, a feature called Expressive Captions is coming that should shine a light on a person's emotion in a video, despite the sound being turned off. These Expressive Captions are also coming to YouTube as part of Android's new accessibility updates. Additional features include Fast Pair for hearing aids and Guided Frame with Gemini, which gives a description of what's in view on the Pixel camera app. Learn more about all of Android's accessibility updates here.

          "standfirst": "Google has announced a slew of new accessibility features coming to Android ahead of International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday. Advanced voice dictation, expanded support for an external mouse and improved expressive captions are just some of the features aiming to make Android a more accessible mobile experience. A more advanced dark theme is now available for devices running Android 16 that will automatically darken most apps even when those apps lack their own native dark modes. Exclusive to Android 16, users can now select between \"Standard\" and \"Expanded\" when setting up Dark theme. For those using a connected mouse with an Android device but who might find the action of clicking difficult, AutoClick now has an improved dwell cursor experience. This feature means the cursor will automatically click after it has paused over something for a certain amount of time, as set by the user. The type of click itself can also be customized, with a user's choice of left-click, right-click, double-click, long press, scroll or drag. Hands-free use is a cornerstone of accessibility for mobile devices, and now Gemini-powered voice dictation within TalkBack will enable typing and text editing using natural commands. Users can start dictating in Gboard with a two-finger double-tap, after which Smart Dictation with Gemini empowers users to say things like \"replace Monday with Tuesday\" to fix a mistake or even ask Gemini to make their message shorter. Google says TalkBack is \"launching soon.\" Google has also added new functionality to Guided Frame, which helps blind or low-vision users take photos in the Pixel camera app. The tool can now describe the scene to the user as well as let them know when there's a face in frame. Voice Access has also been made easier to use in a totally hands-free way. Instead of having to physically tap the phone's screen to start using the feature, users can now say \"Hey Google, start Voice Access\" to gain hands-free control. The feature does need to be enabled first for this to work. Android devices can now pair to Bluetooth LE Audio-enabled hearing aids with a single tap. This expanded use of Fast Pair is compatible with Demant hearing aids and support for Starkey products is coming in early 2026. Finally, Google is also building on expressive captions, the AI powered tool released last year that tries to imbue more feeling into captions. On Android, expressive captions can now \"detect and display the emotional tone of speech\" from the audio playing on your device. Captions will be tagged with emotions like joy or sadness. The feature is also coming to YouTube where captions will now convey the intensity of speech by using all caps, and writing out sounds like sighs and gasps. This will be live for all videos in English uploaded after October. With the exception of TalkBack, which is launching soon, these new accessibility features are live now. As with most Google updates, it may take some time for the updates to hit every device.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/android-is-getting-a-slew-of-new-accessibility-features-190016358.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Cyber Monday speaker deals for 2025 are still available: Save up to 50 percent on Bluetooth speakers, smart speakers and soundbars",
          "standfirst": "If you've ever wanted to hear the drummer coughing on your favorite songs or the actors chewing in your favorite shows, Cyber Monday is the time to upgrade your audio. Some of the best speakers our audiophiles have ever tested are down to as low as we've seen them all year, or ever, in the case of some older models. The deals on this list range across brands, with offerings from Ultimate Ears, Bose, Beats and more, plus Sonos and Amazon Echo smart speakers and soundbars from Sony and JBL. We've been curating it all month and this is the final result — and your last chance to get ahold of most of the best deals. Some of them may last through the week, but we can't always predict which ones, so don't sleep if there's a speaker you're eyeing. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 for $29 (35 percent off): It's incredibly rare to see a full-size Bluetooth speaker selling this cheaply in 2025, especially one we'd actually recommend using. The Soundcore 2 is Anker's latest audio effort, getting you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. In short, no matter how long the adventure or where it's going, the Go 3 can probably get there with you. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Ultimate Ears Wonderbook 4 for $60 (40 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 is the little barrel that could, an adorable 1.2-pound portable bluetooth speaker that stays charged for 14 hours and keeps on playing after a five-foot drop. Outdoor Mode is a standout feature, amplifying the higher frequencies so you can hear from farther away. There's even a USB charger so your other devices can take advantage of that long battery life. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $53 (24 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Cyber Monday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. (Take note that only some colors are discounted.) Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Sony ULT Field 5 for $198 (43 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Sonos Era 100 for $200 (9 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Samsung HW-B650/ZA 3.1 Channel Soundbar for $200 (50 percent off): Samsung's mid-range soundbar is pretty simple, but it does what it needs to do: pump out Dolby 3.1 with enough volume and range to make you forget you aren't in a movie theater. It's versatile, improving both music and dialogue, and keeps everything balanced. The only real drawback is that it lacks wireless connection options other than bluetooth. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect. Bose SoundLink Max for $279 (30 percent off): The SoundLink Max, Bose's biggest speaker that isn't a soundbar, is more affordable for Cyber Monday than we've seen for a while. Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music. Marshall Acton III for $285 (5 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too). It's less portable at 6.3 pounds, but can hit high volumes with little or no distortion. The upgrade angled Acton III's tweeters outward so the soundscape is wider, making this one speaker very capable of filling a room with sound on its own. Marshall Stanmore III for $299 (21 percent off): The Stanmore III is the top-tier Marshall discount of the year, giving you the best of Marshall's 2022 redesign. It's got the same widened soundscape as the Acton III, with an additional 5Hz on the low end and an RCA input alongside its 3.5mm aux input. This retro-designed speaker also features bluetooth, pair play and a construction with 70 percent recycled plastic. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 8 for $798 (20 percent off): In our review of the Bravia 6 this year, we called out its full sound and special talent for enhancing dialogue, but were frustrated that it didn't support AirPlay or Spotify Connect. The Bravia 8 works with both services, making it a clear choice for your next premium soundbar. It's got a tight, low-footprint design that fits any aesthetic, and hits a maximum output power of 495 watts. JBL Bar 1300XMK2 for $1,200 (29 percent off): If you're going to drop $1200 on a soundbar, you need to know it's going to deliver — and the 1300XMK2 does. Its key design element is two detachable speakers that recharge when plugged into the main unit, but can spend up to 10 hours unplugged. The audioscape does an excellent job of separating and clarifying details, which really enhances the sense of a theatrical experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-speaker-deals-for-2025-are-still-available-save-up-to-50-percent-on-bluetooth-speakers-smart-speakers-and-soundbars-213017218.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you've ever wanted to hear the drummer coughing on your favorite songs or the actors chewing in your favorite shows, Cyber Monday is the time to upgrade your audio. Some of the best speakers our audiophiles have ever tested are down to as low as we've seen them all year, or ever, in the case of some older models. The deals on this list range across brands, with offerings from Ultimate Ears, Bose, Beats and more, plus Sonos and Amazon Echo smart speakers and soundbars from Sony and JBL. We've been curating it all month and this is the final result — and your last chance to get ahold of most of the best deals. Some of them may last through the week, but we can't always predict which ones, so don't sleep if there's a speaker you're eyeing. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 for $29 (35 percent off): It's incredibly rare to see a full-size Bluetooth speaker selling this cheaply in 2025, especially one we'd actually recommend using. The Soundcore 2 is Anker's latest audio effort, getting you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. In short, no matter how long the adventure or where it's going, the Go 3 can probably get there with you. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Ultimate Ears Wonderbook 4 for $60 (40 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 is the little barrel that could, an adorable 1.2-pound portable bluetooth speaker that stays charged for 14 hours and keeps on playing after a five-foot drop. Outdoor Mode is a standout feature, amplifying the higher frequencies so you can hear from farther away. There's even a USB charger so your other devices can take advantage of that long battery life. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $53 (24 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Cyber Monday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. (Take note that only some colors are discounted.) Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Sony ULT Field 5 for $198 (43 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Sonos Era 100 for $200 (9 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Samsung HW-B650/ZA 3.1 Channel Soundbar for $200 (50 percent off): Samsung's mid-range soundbar is pretty simple, but it does what it needs to do: pump out Dolby 3.1 with enough volume and range to make you forget you aren't in a movie theater. It's versatile, improving both music and dialogue, and keeps everything balanced. The only real drawback is that it lacks wireless connection options other than bluetooth. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect. Bose SoundLink Max for $279 (30 percent off): The SoundLink Max, Bose's biggest speaker that isn't a soundbar, is more affordable for Cyber Monday than we've seen for a while. Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music. Marshall Acton III for $285 (5 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too).

          "title": "Amazon's new AI can code for days without human help. What does that mean for software engineers?",
          "standfirst": "Amazon Web Services on Tuesday announced a new class of artificial intelligence systems called \"frontier agents\" that can work autonomously for hours or even days without human intervention, representing one of the most ambitious attempts yet to automate the full software development lifecycle.The announcement, made during AWS CEO Matt Garman&#x27;s keynote address at the company&#x27;s annual re:Invent conference, introduces three specialized AI agents designed to act as virtual team members: Kiro autonomous agent for software development, AWS Security Agent for application security, and AWS DevOps Agent for IT operations.The move signals Amazon&#x27;s intent to leap ahead in the intensifying competition to build AI systems capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks that currently require teams of skilled engineers.\"We see frontier agents as a completely new class of agents,\" said Deepak Singh, vice president of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, in an interview ahead of the announcement. \"They&#x27;re fundamentally designed to work for hours and days. You&#x27;re not giving them a problem that you want finished in the next five minutes. You&#x27;re giving them complex challenges that they may have to think about, try different solutions, and get to the right conclusion — and they should do that without intervention.\"Why Amazon believes its new agents leave existing AI coding tools behindThe frontier agents differ from existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Amazon&#x27;s own CodeWhisperer in several fundamental ways.Current AI coding tools, while powerful, require engineers to drive every interaction. Developers must write prompts, provide context, and manually coordinate work across different code repositories. When switching between tasks, the AI loses context and must start fresh.The new frontier agents, by contrast, maintain persistent memory across sessions and continuously learn from an organization&#x27;s codebase, documentation, and team communications. They can independently determine which code repositories require changes, work on multiple files simultaneously, and coordinate complex transformations spanning dozens of microservices.\"With a current agent, you would go microservice by microservice, making changes one at a time, and each change would be a different session with no shared context,\" Singh explained. \"With a frontier agent, you say, &#x27;I need to solve this broad problem.&#x27; You point it to the right application, and it decides which repos need changes.\"The agents exhibit three defining characteristics that AWS believes set them apart: autonomy in decision-making, the ability to scale by spawning multiple agents to work on different aspects of a problem simultaneously, and the capacity to operate independently for extended periods.\"A frontier agent can decide to spin up 10 versions of itself, all working on different parts of the problem at once,\" Singh said.How each of the three frontier agents tackles a different phase of developmentKiro autonomous agent serves as a virtual developer that maintains context across coding sessions and learns from an organization&#x27;s pull requests, code reviews, and technical discussions. Teams can connect it to GitHub, Jira, Slack, and internal documentation systems. The agent then acts like a teammate, accepting task assignments and working independently until it either completes the work or requires human guidance.AWS Security Agent embeds security expertise throughout the development process, automatically reviewing design documents and scanning pull requests against organizational security requirements. Perhaps most significantly, it transforms penetration testing from a weeks-long manual process into an on-demand capability that completes in hours.SmugMug, a photo hosting platform, has already deployed the security agent. \"AWS Security Agent helped catch a business logic bug that no existing tools would have caught, exposing information improperly,\" said Andres Ruiz, staff software engineer at the company. \"To any other tool, this would have been invisible. But the ability for Security Agent to contextualize the information, parse the API response, and find the unexpected information there represents a leap forward in automated security testing.\"AWS DevOps Agent functions as an always-on operations team member, responding instantly to incidents and using its accumulated knowledge to identify root causes. It connects to observability tools including Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic, and Splunk, along with runbooks and deployment pipelines.Commonwealth Bank of Australia tested the DevOps agent by replicating a complex network and identity management issue that typically requires hours for experienced engineers to diagnose. The agent identified the root cause in under 15 minutes.\"AWS DevOps Agent thinks and acts like a seasoned DevOps engineer, helping our engineers build a banking infrastructure that&#x27;s faster, more resilient, and designed to deliver better experiences for our customers,\" said Jason Sandry, head of cloud services at Commonwealth Bank.Amazon makes its case against Google and Microsoft in the AI coding warsThe announcement arrives amid a fierce battle among technology giants to dominate the emerging market for AI-powered development tools. Google has made significant noise in recent weeks with its own AI coding capabilities, while Microsoft continues to advance GitHub Copilot and its broader AI development toolkit.Singh argued that AWS holds distinct advantages rooted in the company&#x27;s 20-year history operating cloud infrastructure and Amazon&#x27;s own massive software engineering organization.\"AWS has been the cloud of choice for 20 years, so we have two decades of knowledge building and running it, and working with customers who&#x27;ve been building and running applications on it,\" Singh said. \"The learnings from operating AWS, the knowledge our customers have, the experience we&#x27;ve built using these tools ourselves every day to build real-world applications—all of that is embodied in these frontier agents.\"He drew a distinction between tools suitable for prototypes versus production systems. \"There&#x27;s a lot of things out there that you can use to build your prototype or your toy application. But if you want to build production applications, there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that apply here.\"The safeguards Amazon built to keep autonomous agents from going rogueThe prospect of AI systems operating autonomously for days raises immediate questions about what happens when they go off track. Singh described multiple safeguards built into the system.All learnings accumulated by the agents are logged and visible, allowing engineers to understand what knowledge influences the agent&#x27;s decisions. Teams can even remove specific learnings if they discover the agent has absorbed incorrect information from team communications.\"You can go in and even redact that from its knowledge like, &#x27;No, we don&#x27;t want you to ever use this knowledge,&#x27;\" Singh said. \"You can look at the knowledge like it&#x27;s almost—it&#x27;s like looking at your neurons inside your brain. You can disconnect some.\"Engineers can also monitor agent activity in real-time and intervene when necessary, either redirecting the agent or taking over entirely. Most critically, the agents never commit code directly to production systems. That responsibility remains with human engineers.\"These agents are never going to check the code into production. That is still the human&#x27;s responsibility,\" Singh emphasized. \"You are still, as an engineer, responsible for the code you&#x27;re checking in, whether it&#x27;s generated by you or by an agent working autonomously.\"What frontier agents mean for the future of software engineering jobsThe announcement inevitably raises concerns about the impact on software engineering jobs. Singh pushed back against the notion that frontier agents will replace developers, framing them instead as tools that amplify human capabilities.\"Software engineering is craft. What&#x27;s changing is not, &#x27;Hey, agents are doing all the work.&#x27; The craft of software engineering is changing—how you use agents, how do you set up your code base, how do you set up your prompts, how do you set up your rules, how do you set up your knowledge bases so that agents can be effective,\" he said.Singh noted that senior engineers who had drifted away from hands-on coding are now writing more code than ever. \"It&#x27;s actually easier for them to become software engineers,\" he said.He pointed to an internal example where a team completed a project in 78 days that would have taken 18 months using traditional practices. \"Because they were able to use AI. And the thing that made it work was not just the fact that they were using AI, but how they organized and set up their practices of how they built that software were maximized around that.\"How Amazon plans to make AI-generated code more trustworthy over timeSingh outlined several areas where frontier agents will evolve over the coming years. Multi-agent architectures, where systems of specialized agents coordinate to solve complex problems, represent a major frontier. So does the integration of formal verification techniques to increase confidence in AI-generated code.AWS recently introduced property-based testing in Kiro, which uses automated reasoning to extract testable properties from specifications and generate thousands of test scenarios automatically.\"If you have a shopping cart application, every way an order can be canceled, and how it might be canceled, and the way refunds are handled in Germany versus the US—if you&#x27;re writing a unit test, maybe two, Germany and US, but now, because you have this property-based testing approach, your agent can create a scenario for every country you operate in and test all of them automatically for you,\" Singh explained.Building trust in autonomous systems remains the central challenge. \"Right now you still require tons of human guardrails at every step to make sure that the right thing happens. And as we get better at these techniques, you will use less and less, and you&#x27;ll be able to trust the agents a lot more,\" he said.Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI stretches far beyond writing codeThe frontier agents announcement arrived alongside a cascade of other news at re:Invent 2025. AWS kicked off the conference with major announcements on agentic AI capabilities, customer service innovations, and multicloud networking.Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio with four new models delivering industry-leading price-performance across reasoning, multimodal processing, conversational AI, code generation, and agentic tasks. Nova Forge pioneers \"open training,\" giving organizations access to pre-trained model checkpoints and the ability to blend proprietary data with Amazon Nova-curated datasets.AWS also added 18 new open weight models to Amazon Bedrock, reinforcing its commitment to offering a broad selection of fully managed models from leading AI providers. The launch includes new models from Mistral AI, Google&#x27;s Gemma 3, MiniMax&#x27;s M2, NVIDIA&#x27;s Nemotron, and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT OSS Safeguard.On the infrastructure side, Amazon EC2 Trn3 UltraServers, powered by AWS&#x27;s first 3nm AI chip, pack up to 144 Trainium3 chips into a single integrated system, delivering up to 4.4x more compute performance and 4x greater energy efficiency than the previous generation. AWS AI Factories provides enterprises and government organizations with dedicated AWS AI infrastructure deployed in their own data centers, combining NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium chips, AWS networking, and AI services like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker AI.All three frontier agents launched in preview on Tuesday. Pricing will be announced when the services reach general availability.Singh made clear the company sees applications far beyond coding. \"These are the first frontier agents we are releasing, and they&#x27;re in the software development lifecycle,\" he said. \"The problems and use cases for frontier agents—these agents that are long running, capable of autonomy, thinking, always learning and improving—can be applied to many, many domains.\"Amazon, after all, operates satellite networks, runs robotics warehouses, and manages one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce platforms. If autonomous agents can learn to write code on their own, the company is betting they can eventually learn to do just about anything else.",

So does the integration of formal verification techniques to increase confidence in AI-generated code.AWS recently introduced property-based testing in Kiro, which uses automated reasoning to extract testable properties from specifications and generate thousands of test scenarios automatically.\"If you have a shopping cart application, every way an order can be canceled, and how it might be canceled, and the way refunds are handled in Germany versus the US—if you&#x27;re writing a unit test, maybe two, Germany and US, but now, because you have this property-based testing approach, your agent can create a scenario for every country you operate in and test all of them automatically for you,\" Singh explained.Building trust in autonomous systems remains the central challenge. \"Right now you still require tons of human guardrails at every step to make sure that the right thing happens. And as we get better at these techniques, you will use less and less, and you&#x27;ll be able to trust the agents a lot more,\" he said.Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI stretches far beyond writing codeThe frontier agents announcement arrived alongside a cascade of other news at re:Invent 2025. AWS kicked off the conference with major announcements on agentic AI capabilities, customer service innovations, and multicloud networking.Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio with four new models delivering industry-leading price-performance across reasoning, multimodal processing, conversational AI, code generation, and agentic tasks. Nova Forge pioneers \"open training,\" giving organizations access to pre-trained model checkpoints and the ability to blend proprietary data with Amazon Nova-curated datasets.AWS also added 18 new open weight models to Amazon Bedrock, reinforcing its commitment to offering a broad selection of fully managed models from leading AI providers. The launch includes new models from Mistral AI, Google&#x27;s Gemma 3, MiniMax&#x27;s M2, NVIDIA&#x27;s Nemotron, and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT OSS Safeguard.On the infrastructure side, Amazon EC2 Trn3 UltraServers, powered by AWS&#x27;s first 3nm AI chip, pack up to 144 Trainium3 chips into a single integrated system, delivering up to 4.4x more compute performance and 4x greater energy efficiency than the previous generation. AWS AI Factories provides enterprises and government organizations with dedicated AWS AI infrastructure deployed in their own data centers, combining NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium chips, AWS networking, and AI services like Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker AI.All three frontier agents launched in preview on Tuesday. Pricing will be announced when the services reach general availability.Singh made clear the company sees applications far beyond coding. \"These are the first frontier agents we are releasing, and they&#x27;re in the software development lifecycle,\" he said. \"The problems and use cases for frontier agents—these agents that are long running, capable of autonomy, thinking, always learning and improving—can be applied to many, many domains.\"Amazon, after all, operates satellite networks, runs robotics warehouses, and manages one of the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce platforms. If autonomous agents can learn to write code on their own, the company is betting they can eventually learn to do just about anything else.",

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday has ended; The deals party is over. But like any party, there are still a few stragglers not ready to go home just yet. This list once housed over 75 stellar Black Friday deals under $50 each. Today, we've found around 30 or so that are still within a couple bucks of their sales event low. You can get wall chargers, Roku streaming sticks, stocking-stuffer Lego sets, Bluetooth trackers and a couple of small speakers at a discount. This is still stuff Engadget has tested and recommend in our guides — yes, these are late-stage deals but the devices are still solid. Here are the best extended Cyber Monday deals you can still get for under $50. Under $50 Cyber Monday deals that you can still get Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Audible (3 months) for $3 ($42 off): As it does every sales event, Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. With the plan, you get one audiobook of your choice each month, which includes new and bestseller titles. You can also listen to an unlimited number of titles from a narrower library. A membership also grants access to a daily discounted title and other member-only discounts. With this deal, the plan will auto-renew at a dollar per month for three months, then default to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. The offer ends December 16. Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. It went as low as $33 during the sale. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Amazon: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Amazon: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Cyber Monday. This cute-as-a-button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 ($4 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. This is a dollar more than it sold for during the sale. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. This is two dollars more than it sold for during the sale. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $33 ($17 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). It was $3 cheaper during the sale. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. This is $2 more than it sold for during Black Friday. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $35 ($12 off) at Samsung: We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal is a few dollars more than during Cyber Monday. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off with Prime) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday has come and gone, but if you’re still hoping to make a living room upgrade for the holidays, a handful of the better TV deals from the past week are still available. We’ve scoured the web and picked out the best of what's left below. The offers include a few well-reviewed OLED TVs from Samsung, Sony and LG. as well as a couple noteworthy budget models from Hisense. If you're happy with your current TV, some discounts on streaming gear are still live too. Best Cyber Monday TV deals still available Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is an entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the competing TCL QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so that model should be a better buy when the two are the same price. This set also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can reach a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($890) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a mid-tier mini-LED TV and a fairly sizable step up over the U65QG. Its main advantage over rivals like the TCL QM7K is that it can get seriously bright, which helps HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, so it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. You may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion, etc. — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. (The C5 isn't discounted right now.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal has been live for a few weeks but still matches the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds of dollars less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals still available Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of Roku's higher-end Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Walmart. Roku Ultra for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the company's streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Walmart. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. Paramount says this offer will end today.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-tv-deals-that-are-still-available-include-sets-from-samsung-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-190000746.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A lot of people think Cyber Monday subscriptions are just about streaming, but that's not true. Although there are some incredible discounts to be had on the likes of Stars (Outlander and Spartacus) and Paramount+ (Yellowjackets and Star Trek), there's more to the story. We've also found great deals on exciting learning platforms like MasterClass and Rosetta Stone, cord-cutting services like DirecTV and Fubo and useful privacy services like Proton VPN and ExpressVPN. Read on to see which deals are still active. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Lower Decks, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. DirectTV (first month) for $50 (44 percent off): If you're a cord-cutter with a more general taste in TV, DirectTV is the perfect way for you to keep enjoying live channels without cable. This deal only applies for your first month, but it's great for seeing if DirectTV will work for you long-term. Better yet, any DirectTV subscription also comes with free access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Unlimited. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobook lover can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year because (true to its name) it's the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Cyber Monday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. The Wall Street Journal (one year) for $12 (90 percent off): Let's get really old-school for a moment. If you want to add some classic journalism to your diet (and you're OK with ignoring a right-leaning opinion page), one of America's \"papers of record\" is cutting annual subscription costs by 90 percent. That's enough to get you financial, US and world news all the way to the next Cyber Monday, when they'll probably do this again. Infinite money glitch! Best VPN deals for Cyber Monday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $97.72 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-you-can-still-get-big-discounts-on-starz-masterclass-headspace-and-more-174507557.html?src=rss",

Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-you-can-still-get-big-discounts-on-starz-masterclass-headspace-and-more-174507557.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "When it comes to holiday video game gifts, Nintendo gear is often at the top of the list for kids and adults like. This year likely more so than ever thanks to the launch of the Switch 2 back in the spring. But if you were hoping to save money on the console with Cyber Monday gaming deals still live, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Cyber Monday sale was announced a few weeks ago, and unsurprisingly, there are a scant few real \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo, though — actual Nintendo Cyber Monday deals are few and far between. However, there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before this year is over. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Walmart currently have the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that on Walmart, you'll have to be signed into a Walmart account, which is free to make, and add the item to your cart to see the discounted price. There's no telling how long this deal will last. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, as well as other classics like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

          "standfirst": "The sales have officially ended. Cyber Monday and Black Friday are behind us and most deals have slipped back in to their deal caves to hibernate until the next sale event. But! There are still a few deals that haven't packed it in yet. And there are still a few discounts left on Apple gear. The standout is the new Apple Watch Series 11 that's still down to the all-time low it hit during the sales. That's $70 off and the best price on the wearable so far. The AirPods 4 without ANC are $80, which is more than the all-time low, but still nearly a $50 discount. If you still have a few Apple devices on your wish list, here are the Apple deals from Cyber Monday that still remain. Cyber Monday Apple deals still available AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $99 ($80 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,779 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Best Buy. It went as low as $1,699 during the sale. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Apple AirTag (single) for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: Still the most popular finding fob for iPhone users, the AirTag is known for its uncanny ability to find lost things by anonymously pinging nearby iPhones. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. The deal has been vacillating between $49 and $69 over the shopping holiday. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. The $95 price is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apple-cyber-monday-deals-you-can-still-get-include-discounts-on-apple-watches-and-airpods-4-182846356.html?src=rss",

Thankfully, there are lots of Cyber Monday streaming deals still available. If you're not sure about Starz, you can test the waters by paying $1 monthly, down from $11. That comes out to just $12 for the whole year when you pay upfront for the whole term. There's also a month-to-month option that brings the price down to $3 monthly, but only for your first three months. If Starz isn't for you, check out some of the other great streaming deals still available post-Cyber Monday. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. This deal ends December 2. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is officially done, but many of its best gaming deals are still available. If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, we've rounded up the best of what's left below. The highlights include a $50 drop for the Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for various Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on mice, keyboards and headsets we like. Cyber Monday game console deals still available Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $449 at Walmart ($50 off): This is the first widely available discount we’ve seen for Nintendo’s latest hybrid console. If our experience is any indication, you’ll need to be signed into a Walmart account to see the discount, but it should still be available when you add the device to your cart. For reference, Nintendo normally sells the console alone for $449 and this bundle with the kart racer Mario Kart World for $499, so you're essentially getting the game at no extra cost. Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Target ($101 off): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at PlayStation, Amazon, Best Buy and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals still available Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you need more storage for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Cyber Monday PS5 deals still available Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $169 at Amazon ($31 off): Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. We saw it fall to $160 earlier this week, but this is still a noteworthy discount. Also at Best Buy, Target, PlayStation and others. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there aren't any deals for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Target and Amazon. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Best Buy ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Target and PlayStation. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Ragnarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton more first-party PS5 games for Black Friday and Cyber Monday beyond that. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, Returnal, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Cyber Monday Xbox deals still available Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Target, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device's usual street price as of late. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its best-ever price. Also at Best Buy. Cyber Monday video game deals still available Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at PlayStation ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the PlayStation and Xbox editions. Also at Xbox and Humble. Split Fiction for $40 at Walmart ($10 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. We saw it fall as low as $30 last week, but this is a useful $10 discount for the Switch 2, Xbox and PC versions all the same. Also at Nintendo, Steam and Xbox. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at Xbox ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for Xbox version. Also at Humble, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Xbox ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at Steam ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Nintendo. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at PlayStation. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming handheld deals still available Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $194 at Retroid ($15 off): A recommendation from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Cyber Monday VR headset deals still available PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday gaming keyboard deals still available Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals still available Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Walmart. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Corsair ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. Also at Corsair. Cyber Monday gaming headset deals still available Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-gaming-deals-that-are-still-available-save-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-consoles-xbox-controllers-tons-of-games-and-more-172904125.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cyber Monday is officially done, but many of its best gaming deals are still available. If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, we've rounded up the best of what's left below. The highlights include a $50 drop for the Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for various Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on mice, keyboards and headsets we like. Cyber Monday game console deals still available Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $449 at Walmart ($50 off): This is the first widely available discount we’ve seen for Nintendo’s latest hybrid console. If our experience is any indication, you’ll need to be signed into a Walmart account to see the discount, but it should still be available when you add the device to your cart. For reference, Nintendo normally sells the console alone for $449 and this bundle with the kart racer Mario Kart World for $499, so you're essentially getting the game at no extra cost. Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Target ($101 off): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at PlayStation, Amazon, Best Buy and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals still available Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you need more storage for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Cyber Monday PS5 deals still available Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $169 at Amazon ($31 off): Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities.

We saw it fall to $160 earlier this week, but this is still a noteworthy discount. Also at Best Buy, Target, PlayStation and others. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default.

Cyber Monday Xbox deals still available Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Target, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device's usual street price as of late.

This year in particular has been bleak, with Disney+ and HBO Max being just a couple of the services that have increased prices as of late.If you’re like any of us at Engadget, you probably subscribe to more than a few of these services, and costs quickly add up even without the period price increases. While you can find the occasional streaming deal throughout the year, Cyber Monday is the time when they are most abundant. Although Cyber Monday is over, some of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals are still available today. These are the best you can still get this year; just note that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. This deal ends December 2. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well. If you're looking for a more affordable plan, the News + Sports tier has a $10 discount for new subscribers. DirecTV — starting at $50/month for one month: All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-streaming-deals-for-2025-paramount-starz-masterclass-and-others-to-shop-while-theyre-still-available-172013703.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Mistral launches Mistral 3, a family of open models designed to run on laptops, drones, and edge devices",
          "standfirst": "Mistral AI, Europe&#x27;s most prominent artificial intelligence startup, is releasing its most ambitious product suite to date: a family of 10 open-source models designed to run everywhere from smartphones and autonomous drones to enterprise cloud systems, marking a major escalation in the company&#x27;s challenge to both U.S. tech giants and surging Chinese competitors.The Mistral 3 family, launching today, includes a new flagship model called Mistral Large 3 and a suite of smaller \"Ministral 3\" models optimized for edge computing applications. All models will be released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial use — a sharp contrast to the closed systems offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.The release is a pointed bet by Mistral that the future of artificial intelligence lies not in building ever-larger proprietary systems, but in offering businesses maximum flexibility to customize and deploy AI tailored to their specific needs, often using smaller models that can run without cloud connectivity.\"The gap between closed and open source is getting smaller, because more and more people are contributing to open source, which is great,\" Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s chief scientist and co-founder, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We are catching up fast.\"Why Mistral is choosing flexibility over frontier performance in the AI raceThe strategic calculus behind Mistral 3 diverges sharply from recent model releases by industry leaders. While OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have focused recent launches on increasingly capable \"agentic\" systems — AI that can autonomously execute complex multi-step tasks — Mistral is prioritizing breadth, efficiency, and what Lample calls \"distributed intelligence.\"Mistral Large 3, the flagship model, employs a Mixture of Experts architecture with 41 billion active parameters drawn from a total pool of 675 billion parameters. The model can process both text and images, handles context windows up to 256,000 tokens, and was trained with particular emphasis on non-English languages — a rarity among frontier AI systems.\"Most AI labs focus on their native language, but Mistral Large 3 was trained on a wide variety of languages, making advanced AI useful for billions who speak different native languages,\" the company said in a statement reviewed ahead of the announcement.But the more significant departure lies in the Ministral 3 lineup: nine compact models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants tailored for different use cases. Each variant serves a distinct purpose: base models for extensive customization, instruction-tuned models for general chat and task completion, and reasoning-optimized models for complex logic requiring step-by-step deliberation.The smallest Ministral 3 models can run on devices with as little as 4 gigabytes of video memory using 4-bit quantization — making frontier AI capabilities accessible on standard laptops, smartphones, and embedded systems without requiring expensive cloud infrastructure or even internet connectivity. This approach reflects Mistral&#x27;s belief that AI&#x27;s next evolution will be defined not by sheer scale, but by ubiquity: models small enough to run on drones, in vehicles, in robots, and on consumer devices.How fine-tuned small models beat expensive large models for enterprise customersLample&#x27;s comments reveal a business model fundamentally different from that of closed-source competitors. Rather than competing primarily on benchmark performance, Mistral is targeting enterprise customers frustrated by the cost and inflexibility of proprietary systems.\"Sometimes customers say, &#x27;Is there a use case where the best closed-source model isn&#x27;t working?&#x27; If that&#x27;s the case, then they&#x27;re essentially stuck,\" Lample explained. \"There&#x27;s nothing they can do. It&#x27;s the best model available, and it&#x27;s not working out of the box.\"This is where Mistral&#x27;s approach diverges. When a generic model fails, the company deploys engineering teams to work directly with customers, analyzing specific problems, creating synthetic training data, and fine-tuning smaller models to outperform larger general-purpose systems on narrow tasks.\"In more than 90% of cases, a small model can do the job, especially if it&#x27;s fine-tuned. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a model with hundreds of billions of parameters, just a 14-billion or 24-billion parameter model,\" Lample said. \"So it&#x27;s not only much cheaper, but also faster, plus you have all the benefits: you don&#x27;t need to worry about privacy, latency, reliability, and so on.\"The economic argument is compelling. Multiple enterprise customers have approached Mistral after building prototypes with expensive closed-source models, only to find deployment costs prohibitive at scale, according to Lample.\"They come back to us a couple of months later because they realize, &#x27;We built this prototype, but it&#x27;s way too slow and way too expensive,&#x27;\" he said.Where Mistral 3 fits in the increasingly crowded open-source AI marketMistral&#x27;s release comes amid fierce competition on multiple fronts. OpenAI recently released GPT-5.1 with enhanced agentic capabilities. Google launched Gemini 3 with improved multimodal understanding. Anthropic released Opus 4.5 on the same day as this interview, with similar agent-focused features.But Lample argues those comparisons miss the point. \"It&#x27;s a little bit behind. But I think what matters is that we are catching up fast,\" he acknowledged regarding performance against closed models. \"I think we are maybe playing a strategic long game.\"That long game involves a different competitive set: primarily open-source models from Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen series, which have made remarkable strides in recent months.Mistral differentiates itself through multilingual capabilities that extend far beyond English or Chinese, multimodal integration handling both text and images in a unified model, and what the company characterizes as superior customization through easier fine-tuning.\"One key difference with the models themselves is that we focused much more on multilinguality,\" Lample said. \"If you look at all the top models from [Chinese competitors], they&#x27;re all text-only. They have visual models as well, but as separate systems. We wanted to integrate everything into a single model.\"The multilingual emphasis aligns with Mistral&#x27;s broader positioning as a European AI champion focused on digital sovereignty — the principle that organizations and nations should maintain control over their AI infrastructure and data.Building beyond models: Mistral&#x27;s full-stack enterprise AI platform strategyMistral 3&#x27;s release builds on an increasingly comprehensive enterprise AI platform that extends well beyond model development. The company has assembled a full-stack offering that differentiates it from pure model providers.Recent product launches include Mistral Agents API, which combines language models with built-in connectors for code execution, web search, image generation, and persistent memory across conversations; Magistral, the company&#x27;s reasoning model designed for domain-specific, transparent, and multilingual reasoning; and Mistral Code, an AI-powered coding assistant bundling models, an in-IDE assistant, and local deployment options with enterprise tooling.The consumer-facing Le Chat assistant has been enhanced with Deep Research mode for structured research reports, voice capabilities, and Projects for organizing conversations into context-rich folders. More recently, Le Chat gained a connector directory with 20+ enterprise integrations powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), spanning tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Atlassian, Asana, and Stripe.In October, Mistral unveiled AI Studio, a production AI platform providing observability, agent runtime, and AI registry capabilities to help enterprises track output changes, monitor usage, run evaluations, and fine-tune models using proprietary data.Mistral now positions itself as a full-stack, global enterprise AI company, offering not just models but an application-building layer through AI Studio, compute infrastructure, and forward-deployed engineers to help businesses realize return on investment.Why open source AI matters for customization, transparency and sovereigntyMistral&#x27;s commitment to open-source development under permissive licenses is both an ideological stance and a competitive strategy in an AI landscape increasingly dominated by closed systems.Lample elaborated on the practical benefits: \"I think something that people don&#x27;t realize — but our customers know this very well — is how much better any model can actually improve if you fine tune it on the task of interest. There&#x27;s a huge gap between a base model and one that&#x27;s fine-tuned for a specific task, and in many cases, it outperforms the closed-source model.\"The approach enables capabilities impossible with closed systems: organizations can fine-tune models on proprietary data that never leaves their infrastructure, customize architectures for specific workflows, and maintain complete transparency into how AI systems make decisions — critical for regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and defense.This positioning has attracted government and public sector partnerships. The company launched \"AI for Citizens\" in July 2025, an initiative to \"help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services\" and has secured strategic partnerships with France&#x27;s army and job agency, Luxembourg&#x27;s government, and various European public sector organizations.Mistral&#x27;s transatlantic AI collaboration goes beyond European bordersWhile Mistral is frequently characterized as Europe&#x27;s answer to OpenAI, the company views itself as a transatlantic collaboration rather than a purely European venture. The company has teams across both continents, with co-founders spending significant time with customers and partners in the United States, and these models are being trained in partnerships with U.S.-based teams and infrastructure providers.This transatlantic positioning may prove strategically important as geopolitical tensions around AI development intensify. The recent ASML investment, a €1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) funding round led by the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, signals deepening collaboration across the Western semiconductor and AI value chain at a moment when both Europe and the United States are seeking to reduce dependence on Chinese technology.Mistral&#x27;s investor base reflects this dynamic: the Series C round included participation from U.S. firms Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Lightspeed, and Index Ventures alongside European investors like France&#x27;s state-backed Bpifrance and global players like DST Global and Nvidia.Founded in May 2023 by former Google DeepMind and Meta researchers, Mistral has raised roughly $1.05 billion (€1 billion) in funding. The company was valued at $6 billion in a June 2024 Series B, then more than doubled its valuation in a September Series C.Can customization and efficiency beat raw performance in enterprise AI?The Mistral 3 release crystallizes a fundamental question facing the AI industry: Will enterprises ultimately prioritize the absolute cutting-edge capabilities of proprietary systems, or will they choose open, customizable alternatives that offer greater control, lower costs, and independence from big tech platforms?Mistral&#x27;s answer is unambiguous. The company is betting that as AI moves from prototype to production, the factors that matter most shift dramatically. Raw benchmark scores matter less than total cost of ownership. Slight performance edges matter less than the ability to fine-tune for specific workflows. Cloud-based convenience matters less than data sovereignty and edge deployment.It&#x27;s a wager with significant risks. Despite Lample&#x27;s optimism about closing the performance gap, Mistral&#x27;s models still trail the absolute frontier. The company&#x27;s revenue, while growing, reportedly remains modest relative to its nearly $14 billion valuation. And competition intensifies from both well-funded Chinese rivals making remarkable open-source progress and U.S. tech giants increasingly offering their own smaller, more efficient models.But if Mistral is right — if the future of AI looks less like a handful of cloud-based oracles and more like millions of specialized systems running everywhere from factory floors to smartphones — then the company has positioned itself at the center of that transformation.The release of Mistral 3 is the most comprehensive expression yet of that vision: 10 models, spanning every size category, optimized for every deployment scenario, available to anyone who wants to build with them.Whether \"distributed intelligence\" becomes the industry&#x27;s dominant paradigm or remains a compelling alternative serving a narrower market will determine not just Mistral&#x27;s fate, but the broader question of who controls the AI future — and whether that future will be open.For now, the race is on. And Mistral is betting it can win not by building the biggest model, but by building everywhere else.",

All models will be released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial use — a sharp contrast to the closed systems offered by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.The release is a pointed bet by Mistral that the future of artificial intelligence lies not in building ever-larger proprietary systems, but in offering businesses maximum flexibility to customize and deploy AI tailored to their specific needs, often using smaller models that can run without cloud connectivity.\"The gap between closed and open source is getting smaller, because more and more people are contributing to open source, which is great,\" Guillaume Lample, Mistral&#x27;s chief scientist and co-founder, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We are catching up fast.\"Why Mistral is choosing flexibility over frontier performance in the AI raceThe strategic calculus behind Mistral 3 diverges sharply from recent model releases by industry leaders. While OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have focused recent launches on increasingly capable \"agentic\" systems — AI that can autonomously execute complex multi-step tasks — Mistral is prioritizing breadth, efficiency, and what Lample calls \"distributed intelligence.\"Mistral Large 3, the flagship model, employs a Mixture of Experts architecture with 41 billion active parameters drawn from a total pool of 675 billion parameters. The model can process both text and images, handles context windows up to 256,000 tokens, and was trained with particular emphasis on non-English languages — a rarity among frontier AI systems.\"Most AI labs focus on their native language, but Mistral Large 3 was trained on a wide variety of languages, making advanced AI useful for billions who speak different native languages,\" the company said in a statement reviewed ahead of the announcement.But the more significant departure lies in the Ministral 3 lineup: nine compact models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants tailored for different use cases. Each variant serves a distinct purpose: base models for extensive customization, instruction-tuned models for general chat and task completion, and reasoning-optimized models for complex logic requiring step-by-step deliberation.The smallest Ministral 3 models can run on devices with as little as 4 gigabytes of video memory using 4-bit quantization — making frontier AI capabilities accessible on standard laptops, smartphones, and embedded systems without requiring expensive cloud infrastructure or even internet connectivity. This approach reflects Mistral&#x27;s belief that AI&#x27;s next evolution will be defined not by sheer scale, but by ubiquity: models small enough to run on drones, in vehicles, in robots, and on consumer devices.How fine-tuned small models beat expensive large models for enterprise customersLample&#x27;s comments reveal a business model fundamentally different from that of closed-source competitors. Rather than competing primarily on benchmark performance, Mistral is targeting enterprise customers frustrated by the cost and inflexibility of proprietary systems.\"Sometimes customers say, &#x27;Is there a use case where the best closed-source model isn&#x27;t working?&#x27; If that&#x27;s the case, then they&#x27;re essentially stuck,\" Lample explained. \"There&#x27;s nothing they can do. It&#x27;s the best model available, and it&#x27;s not working out of the box.\"This is where Mistral&#x27;s approach diverges. When a generic model fails, the company deploys engineering teams to work directly with customers, analyzing specific problems, creating synthetic training data, and fine-tuning smaller models to outperform larger general-purpose systems on narrow tasks.\"In more than 90% of cases, a small model can do the job, especially if it&#x27;s fine-tuned. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a model with hundreds of billions of parameters, just a 14-billion or 24-billion parameter model,\" Lample said. \"So it&#x27;s not only much cheaper, but also faster, plus you have all the benefits: you don&#x27;t need to worry about privacy, latency, reliability, and so on.\"The economic argument is compelling. Multiple enterprise customers have approached Mistral after building prototypes with expensive closed-source models, only to find deployment costs prohibitive at scale, according to Lample.\"They come back to us a couple of months later because they realize, &#x27;We built this prototype, but it&#x27;s way too slow and way too expensive,&#x27;\" he said.Where Mistral 3 fits in the increasingly crowded open-source AI marketMistral&#x27;s release comes amid fierce competition on multiple fronts. OpenAI recently released GPT-5.1 with enhanced agentic capabilities. Google launched Gemini 3 with improved multimodal understanding. Anthropic released Opus 4.5 on the same day as this interview, with similar agent-focused features.But Lample argues those comparisons miss the point. \"It&#x27;s a little bit behind. But I think what matters is that we are catching up fast,\" he acknowledged regarding performance against closed models. \"I think we are maybe playing a strategic long game.\"That long game involves a different competitive set: primarily open-source models from Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen series, which have made remarkable strides in recent months.Mistral differentiates itself through multilingual capabilities that extend far beyond English or Chinese, multimodal integration handling both text and images in a unified model, and what the company characterizes as superior customization through easier fine-tuning.\"One key difference with the models themselves is that we focused much more on multilinguality,\" Lample said. \"If you look at all the top models from [Chinese competitors], they&#x27;re all text-only. They have visual models as well, but as separate systems. We wanted to integrate everything into a single model.\"The multilingual emphasis aligns with Mistral&#x27;s broader positioning as a European AI champion focused on digital sovereignty — the principle that organizations and nations should maintain control over their AI infrastructure and data.Building beyond models: Mistral&#x27;s full-stack enterprise AI platform strategyMistral 3&#x27;s release builds on an increasingly comprehensive enterprise AI platform that extends well beyond model development. The company has assembled a full-stack offering that differentiates it from pure model providers.Recent product launches include Mistral Agents API, which combines language models with built-in connectors for code execution, web search, image generation, and persistent memory across conversations; Magistral, the company&#x27;s reasoning model designed for domain-specific, transparent, and multilingual reasoning; and Mistral Code, an AI-powered coding assistant bundling models, an in-IDE assistant, and local deployment options with enterprise tooling.The consumer-facing Le Chat assistant has been enhanced with Deep Research mode for structured research reports, voice capabilities, and Projects for organizing conversations into context-rich folders. More recently, Le Chat gained a connector directory with 20+ enterprise integrations powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), spanning tools like Databricks, Snowflake, GitHub, Atlassian, Asana, and Stripe.In October, Mistral unveiled AI Studio, a production AI platform providing observability, agent runtime, and AI registry capabilities to help enterprises track output changes, monitor usage, run evaluations, and fine-tune models using proprietary data.Mistral now positions itself as a full-stack, global enterprise AI company, offering not just models but an application-building layer through AI Studio, compute infrastructure, and forward-deployed engineers to help businesses realize return on investment.Why open source AI matters for customization, transparency and sovereigntyMistral&#x27;s commitment to open-source development under permissive licenses is both an ideological stance and a competitive strategy in an AI landscape increasingly dominated by closed systems.Lample elaborated on the practical benefits: \"I think something that people don&#x27;t realize — but our customers know this very well — is how much better any model can actually improve if you fine tune it on the task of interest. There&#x27;s a huge gap between a base model and one that&#x27;s fine-tuned for a specific task, and in many cases, it outperforms the closed-source model.\"The approach enables capabilities impossible with closed systems: organizations can fine-tune models on proprietary data that never leaves their infrastructure, customize architectures for specific workflows, and maintain complete transparency into how AI systems make decisions — critical for regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and defense.This positioning has attracted government and public sector partnerships. The company launched \"AI for Citizens\" in July 2025, an initiative to \"help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services\" and has secured strategic partnerships with France&#x27;s army and job agency, Luxembourg&#x27;s government, and various European public sector organizations.Mistral&#x27;s transatlantic AI collaboration goes beyond European bordersWhile Mistral is frequently characterized as Europe&#x27;s answer to OpenAI, the company views itself as a transatlantic collaboration rather than a purely European venture. The company has teams across both continents, with co-founders spending significant time with customers and partners in the United States, and these models are being trained in partnerships with U.S.-based teams and infrastructure providers.This transatlantic positioning may prove strategically important as geopolitical tensions around AI development intensify. The recent ASML investment, a €1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) funding round led by the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, signals deepening collaboration across the Western semiconductor and AI value chain at a moment when both Europe and the United States are seeking to reduce dependence on Chinese technology.Mistral&#x27;s investor base reflects this dynamic: the Series C round included participation from U.S. firms Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, Lightspeed, and Index Ventures alongside European investors like France&#x27;s state-backed Bpifrance and global players like DST Global and Nvidia.Founded in May 2023 by former Google DeepMind and Meta researchers, Mistral has raised roughly $1.05 billion (€1 billion) in funding. The company was valued at $6 billion in a June 2024 Series B, then more than doubled its valuation in a September Series C.Can customization and efficiency beat raw performance in enterprise AI?The Mistral 3 release crystallizes a fundamental question facing the AI industry: Will enterprises ultimately prioritize the absolute cutting-edge capabilities of proprietary systems, or will they choose open, customizable alternatives that offer greater control, lower costs, and independence from big tech platforms?Mistral&#x27;s answer is unambiguous. The company is betting that as AI moves from prototype to production, the factors that matter most shift dramatically. Raw benchmark scores matter less than total cost of ownership. Slight performance edges matter less than the ability to fine-tune for specific workflows. Cloud-based convenience matters less than data sovereignty and edge deployment.It&#x27;s a wager with significant risks. Despite Lample&#x27;s optimism about closing the performance gap, Mistral&#x27;s models still trail the absolute frontier. The company&#x27;s revenue, while growing, reportedly remains modest relative to its nearly $14 billion valuation. And competition intensifies from both well-funded Chinese rivals making remarkable open-source progress and U.S. tech giants increasingly offering their own smaller, more efficient models.But if Mistral is right — if the future of AI looks less like a handful of cloud-based oracles and more like millions of specialized systems running everywhere from factory floors to smartphones — then the company has positioned itself at the center of that transformation.The release of Mistral 3 is the most comprehensive expression yet of that vision: 10 models, spanning every size category, optimized for every deployment scenario, available to anyone who wants to build with them.Whether \"distributed intelligence\" becomes the industry&#x27;s dominant paradigm or remains a compelling alternative serving a narrower market will determine not just Mistral&#x27;s fate, but the broader question of who controls the AI future — and whether that future will be open.For now, the race is on. And Mistral is betting it can win not by building the biggest model, but by building everywhere else.",

          "standfirst": "It’s been 18 years since the last Metroid Prime game, but I felt right at home in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Almost too at home. Whether fighting my way through a volcano, exploring a research base in a frozen tundra or getting lost in a vast desert, I couldn’t shake the feeling I’d done this before. As the fourth game in a series, that’s not a huge surprise, but it was my main disappointment in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Think about the leap Nintendo took going from 2011’s The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and 2017’s Breath of the Wild. They were both recognizably Zelda games, but Nintendo redefined what that means between those two games. No such reinvention has happened with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a great time — it executes the template for a Metroid Prime game extremely well. It’s thrilling to see the series finally make the jump to HD, iconic bounty hunter Samus Aran has some intriguing new powers, there’s a badass motorcycle to shuttle her around the game’s open world hub and the game’s design and art direction show Nintendo at its best. It's everything you’d expect from a Metroid Prime game — no more, no less. Whether that’s a good thing is up to you to decide.If you haven’t played the previous Metroid Prime games before, fear not. There isn’t anything story-wise that you need to know before you jump into this adventure. As with all Metroid games, you take control of acclaimed bounty hunter Samus Aran, an ultra-powerful warrior with a mechanized suit full of fun tricks. The vast majority of the game takes place in first-person view where you can lock on to the many creatures trying to kill you and blast away with an ever-expanding arsenal. The other main interface is your scan visor, where you can learn about your surroundings and enemies to find weaknesses and figure out what you need to do to advance.Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoBeyond throws you right into a firefight that serves as a solid tutorial for the game's varied control schemes. A Galactic Federation outpost is under attack, and Samus flies in to help defend the troops and keep a secret artifact safe. This somewhat bombastic intro is a great way to show off the Switch 2's power. Sure, we're not talking about a PS5 Pro here, but this is perhaps the most visually-advanced game Nintendo has released. With a Switch 2 docked to a TV, you can play it at either 4K / 60fps or 1080p / 120fps (in handheld mode, that drops to 1080p or 720p with the same frame rates). I don’t have a huge TV, so I mostly went with “performance mode,” but in either case the game felt extremely fluid with no frame rate drops and looked outstanding. The game starts as Samus Aran flies in to help the Galactic Federation fight off an invasion, and that opening cut scene shows off with some HDR-enhanced explosions and a detailed environment of a space base in chaos. There are little fires and explosions everywhere; it's visually busy but in a good way that serves the setting, and it all looks vibrant and life-like. As with basically all Nintendo games, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn't aiming for realism, but it's closer to a game like Horizon Forbidden West or Cyberpunk 2077 than any other Nintendo titles I can think of. Things like the textures of metal installations, the leaves on alien trees or Samus' gloves all have a level of textural detail you don't usually see in Nintendo's games. Often, that's due to a conscious art direction choice to go in a more cartoonish direction, but the Switch 2's hardware is helping make the game as lifelike as possible.Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendo(Note that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is also available on the original Switch. I didn’t play it there so I can’t comment on how things like frame rates and textures hold up on that much older console. If you’re thinking about trying this game on the first Switch, it’s probably a good idea to see how other reviewers find that experience before shelling out $60.)The aforementioned intro sets up the big conflict in Beyond. As Samus comes in to try and help the troops defend a mysterious artifact, the game’s big bad Sylux shows up and everything hits the fan. Samus and some other Galactic Federation forces are mysteriously transported to the planet Viewros, where Samus comes into contact with a near-excinct society called the Lamorn. A Lamorn elder telepathically pleads with Samus to try and save the society from being totally forgotten — indeed, she may be able to bring them back from the brink of extinction if all goes well. They’ve been waiting for a “chosen one,” you see, and Samus is naturally it.As part of this intro, Samus gains her signature new physic powers in Beyond. These allow her to interact with otherwise-hidden parts of the environment to solve puzzles. The most significant is the Control Beam. When you charge your arm cannon while in the psychic scan visor mode (a slight tweak on the environmental scanning feature that has been a major part of all Metroid Prime games), you can fire a beam that slows time down and can be controlled with the right joystick. That means you can pass the Control Beam through multiple targets, something you’ll need to do periodically to weaken enemies or unlock the way forward. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoFor the most part, though, the psychic powers besides the beam are just repackaging of already-familiar tools. Metroid veterans will be familiar with the Spider Ball, an upgrade to the Morph Ball that lets Samus magnetically attach to tracks that help her get to out-of-reach areas. In Beyond, you instead get the “Psychic” Spider Ball — that does essentially the same thing. Occasionally, you’ll find Psychic Ball Tracks that you have to scan to reveal; they’ll then blast Samus into a secret area that usually has a weapon upgrade or energy tank. Even Samus’ main weapon gets a fancy “Psychic Beam” name — but the description of it in the inventory admits that it’s the same weapon. “The Psychic Beam’s strength and performance are equal to the standard Power Beam.” While the Control Beam adds a fun wrinkle to the gameplay, the psychic abilities don’t otherwise change the Metroid Prime formula in any significant way.The main task Samus faces is collecting five Teleporter Keys that can get her off the planet. Those keys are hidden in various environments around Viewros that are all connected by Sol Valley, a large desert that holds lots of upgrades and side quests that you’ll need to clear to advance in the game. The desert is more of a hub than an open world — there are small areas to explore dotted around it, but the main action happens in places like Ice Belt, Volt Forge, Flare Pool and several others you’ll find your way to as you collect those teleporter keys. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoAs those names suggest, Ice Belt is a frozen area where you explore an abandoned research facility, while Flare Pool is inside of a volcano. And, as you might expect, you’ll need certain weapons to advance in those areas. In addition to her standard beam and missile weapons, Samus collects the obligatory freeze ray and fire blaster sort of weapons. This is where the game really started to remind me of the original Metroid Prime — the three elemental weapons she collects are essentially the same as those in the first game, and environments like a frozen wasteland or a fiery volcano are nearly identical to ones you’ll find in that game. The Lamorn, meanwhile, reminded me a lot of the departed Chozo tribe you’ll find on Tallon IV in the first Metroid Prime. Of course, that game came out all the way back in 2002, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will likely be the first game of the series many play. A little recycling of classic elements is forgivable. That said, I was a bit disappointed that the game has a tightly-scripted flow. After the intro and the first mission on Viewros, you hit the desert with multiple locations where Teleporter Keys are believed to be hidden. But you can’t tackle them in any order you choose. This is a Metroid game, after all, and that means exploring to find powers that let you explore a new area that was previously closed off. Part of me was hoping for the freedom of a game like Breath of the Wild where you could tackle areas in any order you choose. But after playing through nearly the entire game, I appreciate the excellent execution of the familiar formula. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoAnother thing that’ll be familiar to those who’ve played the older Metroid Prime games is the control scheme. For the most part, you can pick up the controller and get right to it, as the main control layout employs a two-joystick first-person view that should be pretty easy to get the hang of. But there are definitely times where I found myself wishing for more precision. You can lock onto enemies and targets with the ZL button and start blasting away with your chosen weapon, but many of the boss battles require you to lock on to a large creature and then use the right stick to adjust your aim to hit very specific targets. This took some getting used to, because I was used to the lock-on target vulnerable areas. Doing it with a Switch Pro Controller made things much easier, but using the standard Joy-Cons could get frustrating in a hurry. If I was playing in handheld mode, I would often pause before a big battle and wait until I could hook up to my TV and use a proper controller. I’d recommend you do the same — it’ll make for a much more enjoyable experience.Beyond also offers the option of using one Joy-Con in “mouse” mode for aiming while using the other for moving around. For me, this isn’t a viable option. I tried it a few times and immediately felt completely disoriented and far worse at aiming than I was with the right stick. I can appreciate the idea behind offering mouse-like controls for a first-person FPS game, but it just did not feel well executed. That said, this might be on me. I haven’t played a game with a keyboard and mouse in years; nearly all of my gaming is on a twin-stick controller, so I’m just more comfortable with that setup. I’m thinking about starting from the beginning and seeing how I adapt to mouse mode and will update this review if my opinion changes.There are a few things that Beyond does that are completely new to the series. The most obvious one is Vi-O-La, the wild robotic motorcycle that Samus rides. You’ll unlock that early in the game, and its primary utility is to get around Sol Valley. For anyone worried that the game is overly focused on an element that admittedly feels a bit anachronistic to the usual Metroid vibe, fear not. You’ll use it a bunch, but it’s more about fast transportation and exploration than something that has detailed mechanics you need to master. There are a few segments where it’s a major part of the mission, but for the most part it’s just another tool in your arsenal rather than something that steals the focus of the game. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoThe same can be said for the motley crew of adventures you assemble. One of the loudest bits of feedback that came out of the preview Nintendo offered the press a few weeks ago was “what’s the deal with Myles MacKenzie?” You see, in the first hours of the game you come across MacKenzie, a bumbling engineer type who you rescue in the jungles of Viewros shortly after landing on the planet. You then have to escort him around a bit, during which he makes some pretty bad and occasionally obnoxious jokes. This led many who played the preview to worry about MacKenzie shattering the quiet and lonely solitude the Metroid series is known for.Don’t worry — Samus is on her own for the vast majority of the game. You’ll encounter a few more stranded Galactic Federation soldiers throughout the game, but they usually only stick around for short segments before returning to the home base you establish with Myles. And as for Myles himself, he’ll help upgrade your weapons and is available on the radio to give you hints on where you need to go, something that I honestly didn’t mind. I’d rather have hints at hand than spend all my time wandering lost throughout the vast world of Beyond. But I can also see that the hint system is occasionally too aggressive in dropping details on where to go next.As a seasoned player, Beyond mostly felt challenging but fair. Games in the Metroid Prime series are notorious for moments of serious difficulty, but this one feels a little more forgiving. When battling bosses, there were plenty of ammo and energy drops that helped me even the score. I usually died a handful of times while figuring out my strategy or getting a feel for their attacks, but it wasn’t overly frustrating or tedious. That said, there were two bosses near the end (including the final boss) where the difficult curve spiked in a way that felt completely unreasonable. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoThere were also a few times when I felt wildly lost, with no useful information about my next step to be found anywhere on the map. Myles told me to find a member of the crew “out in the desert.” And while Sol Valley isn’t the same open-world scale of some bigger games, it’s still a pretty big space to explore without any other indication of where to go. I wasted far too much time riding my motorcycle across dunes aimlessly figuring out where to go. It wouldn’t be a Metroid game if you didn’t get hopelessly stuck at some point, though.For the most part, I enjoyed the addition of some people helping Samus along her way. It helps flesh out the world of the game in small ways, giving some perspectives on everything going on from people who aren’t ultra-powerful, silent bounty hunters. It did make Samus’ never-ending silence feel a bit awkward, but it also fits with her otherworldly, not-quite-human presence. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoIn some ways, it’s easy to sum up Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s the Metroid Prime experience, modernized. The graphics are better, the world is bigger, experiences like Vi-O-La and Samus’ psychic abilities offer a greater variety of gameplay experiences. But it’s also very much a Metroid Prime game at its core, with the familiar but effective mix of biomes to exploration, giant enemies to dispatch and weapon upgrades to find. And, of course, there were moments of immense frustration when things just got too difficult, another hallmark of the series. Seriously, the final battle is wildly frustrating. Maybe I just need to get good, but it felt so far out of sync with the entire rest of the game that it almost ruined the fun that came before.That intense moment of frustration aside, anyone who played earlier games in the series will find a lot to love here. But, they also might be disappointed that Nintendo didn’t push the series further. However, there are also a lot of people who’ve never played a Metroid Prime game in the last two decades or so — those people will find that the formula Nintendo engineered in the 2000s still holds up here. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is far more unique than your average first-person shooter, it was worth the long wait, and it’s a must-play for anyone who is up for the challenge.

Even Samus’ main weapon gets a fancy “Psychic Beam” name — but the description of it in the inventory admits that it’s the same weapon. “The Psychic Beam’s strength and performance are equal to the standard Power Beam.” While the Control Beam adds a fun wrinkle to the gameplay, the psychic abilities don’t otherwise change the Metroid Prime formula in any significant way.The main task Samus faces is collecting five Teleporter Keys that can get her off the planet. Those keys are hidden in various environments around Viewros that are all connected by Sol Valley, a large desert that holds lots of upgrades and side quests that you’ll need to clear to advance in the game. The desert is more of a hub than an open world — there are small areas to explore dotted around it, but the main action happens in places like Ice Belt, Volt Forge, Flare Pool and several others you’ll find your way to as you collect those teleporter keys. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoAs those names suggest, Ice Belt is a frozen area where you explore an abandoned research facility, while Flare Pool is inside of a volcano. And, as you might expect, you’ll need certain weapons to advance in those areas. In addition to her standard beam and missile weapons, Samus collects the obligatory freeze ray and fire blaster sort of weapons. This is where the game really started to remind me of the original Metroid Prime — the three elemental weapons she collects are essentially the same as those in the first game, and environments like a frozen wasteland or a fiery volcano are nearly identical to ones you’ll find in that game. The Lamorn, meanwhile, reminded me a lot of the departed Chozo tribe you’ll find on Tallon IV in the first Metroid Prime. Of course, that game came out all the way back in 2002, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will likely be the first game of the series many play. A little recycling of classic elements is forgivable. That said, I was a bit disappointed that the game has a tightly-scripted flow. After the intro and the first mission on Viewros, you hit the desert with multiple locations where Teleporter Keys are believed to be hidden. But you can’t tackle them in any order you choose. This is a Metroid game, after all, and that means exploring to find powers that let you explore a new area that was previously closed off. Part of me was hoping for the freedom of a game like Breath of the Wild where you could tackle areas in any order you choose. But after playing through nearly the entire game, I appreciate the excellent execution of the familiar formula. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoAnother thing that’ll be familiar to those who’ve played the older Metroid Prime games is the control scheme. For the most part, you can pick up the controller and get right to it, as the main control layout employs a two-joystick first-person view that should be pretty easy to get the hang of. But there are definitely times where I found myself wishing for more precision. You can lock onto enemies and targets with the ZL button and start blasting away with your chosen weapon, but many of the boss battles require you to lock on to a large creature and then use the right stick to adjust your aim to hit very specific targets. This took some getting used to, because I was used to the lock-on target vulnerable areas. Doing it with a Switch Pro Controller made things much easier, but using the standard Joy-Cons could get frustrating in a hurry. If I was playing in handheld mode, I would often pause before a big battle and wait until I could hook up to my TV and use a proper controller. I’d recommend you do the same — it’ll make for a much more enjoyable experience.Beyond also offers the option of using one Joy-Con in “mouse” mode for aiming while using the other for moving around. For me, this isn’t a viable option. I tried it a few times and immediately felt completely disoriented and far worse at aiming than I was with the right stick. I can appreciate the idea behind offering mouse-like controls for a first-person FPS game, but it just did not feel well executed. That said, this might be on me. I haven’t played a game with a keyboard and mouse in years; nearly all of my gaming is on a twin-stick controller, so I’m just more comfortable with that setup. I’m thinking about starting from the beginning and seeing how I adapt to mouse mode and will update this review if my opinion changes.There are a few things that Beyond does that are completely new to the series. The most obvious one is Vi-O-La, the wild robotic motorcycle that Samus rides. You’ll unlock that early in the game, and its primary utility is to get around Sol Valley. For anyone worried that the game is overly focused on an element that admittedly feels a bit anachronistic to the usual Metroid vibe, fear not. You’ll use it a bunch, but it’s more about fast transportation and exploration than something that has detailed mechanics you need to master. There are a few segments where it’s a major part of the mission, but for the most part it’s just another tool in your arsenal rather than something that steals the focus of the game. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoThe same can be said for the motley crew of adventures you assemble. One of the loudest bits of feedback that came out of the preview Nintendo offered the press a few weeks ago was “what’s the deal with Myles MacKenzie?” You see, in the first hours of the game you come across MacKenzie, a bumbling engineer type who you rescue in the jungles of Viewros shortly after landing on the planet. You then have to escort him around a bit, during which he makes some pretty bad and occasionally obnoxious jokes. This led many who played the preview to worry about MacKenzie shattering the quiet and lonely solitude the Metroid series is known for.Don’t worry — Samus is on her own for the vast majority of the game. You’ll encounter a few more stranded Galactic Federation soldiers throughout the game, but they usually only stick around for short segments before returning to the home base you establish with Myles. And as for Myles himself, he’ll help upgrade your weapons and is available on the radio to give you hints on where you need to go, something that I honestly didn’t mind. I’d rather have hints at hand than spend all my time wandering lost throughout the vast world of Beyond. But I can also see that the hint system is occasionally too aggressive in dropping details on where to go next.As a seasoned player, Beyond mostly felt challenging but fair. Games in the Metroid Prime series are notorious for moments of serious difficulty, but this one feels a little more forgiving. When battling bosses, there were plenty of ammo and energy drops that helped me even the score. I usually died a handful of times while figuring out my strategy or getting a feel for their attacks, but it wasn’t overly frustrating or tedious. That said, there were two bosses near the end (including the final boss) where the difficult curve spiked in a way that felt completely unreasonable. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoThere were also a few times when I felt wildly lost, with no useful information about my next step to be found anywhere on the map. Myles told me to find a member of the crew “out in the desert.” And while Sol Valley isn’t the same open-world scale of some bigger games, it’s still a pretty big space to explore without any other indication of where to go. I wasted far too much time riding my motorcycle across dunes aimlessly figuring out where to go. It wouldn’t be a Metroid game if you didn’t get hopelessly stuck at some point, though.For the most part, I enjoyed the addition of some people helping Samus along her way. It helps flesh out the world of the game in small ways, giving some perspectives on everything going on from people who aren’t ultra-powerful, silent bounty hunters. It did make Samus’ never-ending silence feel a bit awkward, but it also fits with her otherworldly, not-quite-human presence. Metroid Prime 4: BeyondNintendoIn some ways, it’s easy to sum up Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. It’s the Metroid Prime experience, modernized. The graphics are better, the world is bigger, experiences like Vi-O-La and Samus’ psychic abilities offer a greater variety of gameplay experiences. But it’s also very much a Metroid Prime game at its core, with the familiar but effective mix of biomes to exploration, giant enemies to dispatch and weapon upgrades to find. And, of course, there were moments of immense frustration when things just got too difficult, another hallmark of the series. Seriously, the final battle is wildly frustrating. Maybe I just need to get good, but it felt so far out of sync with the entire rest of the game that it almost ruined the fun that came before.That intense moment of frustration aside, anyone who played earlier games in the series will find a lot to love here. But, they also might be disappointed that Nintendo didn’t push the series further. However, there are also a lot of people who’ve never played a Metroid Prime game in the last two decades or so — those people will find that the formula Nintendo engineered in the 2000s still holds up here. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is far more unique than your average first-person shooter, it was worth the long wait, and it’s a must-play for anyone who is up for the challenge.

          "title": "Sony's much-anticipated A7 V is here with a faster 33MP sensor and 4K 120p video",
          "standfirst": "Sony has launched its mid-range flagship mirrorless camera, the A7 V, with a strong emphasis on speed but a bit less on video than some may have hoped. The new model sports a 33MP partially stacked full-frame Exmor RS sensor and an all-new Bionz XR2 processor with built-in AI, powering what the company calls its fastest, most accurate subject-detect autofocus ever. At the same time, it can shoot 14-bit photos at up to 30 fps with 16 stops of dynamic range, the highest ever on a Sony (or nearly any other) camera. On the video side, the A7 V now supports 4K 10-bit S-Log3 video at 60 fps using the full sensor width with supersampling from 7K. Note that to get full-width video in 4K 60 fps mode, you must turn on a feature called Angle of View Priority that turns off in-camera noise reduction but doesn't affect quality, according to Sony. 4K at 120 fps is also possible with an APS-C crop. The graphite heatsink disperses heat well, so you can record 90 minutes continuously at 4K 60 fps. However, the A7 V doesn't offer any resolutions beyond that, unlike its primary rivals in this price range: the Canon R6 III (7K 60 fps), Nikon Z6 III (6K at 60 fps) and Panasonic S1 II (6K at 60 fps). Also surprisingly, there's no internal or external RAW capture, unlike all three rival cameras, with recording limited to Sony's XAVC (H.265 and H.264) formats. Sony Sony told Engadget that rather than RAW or 7K, it preferred to focus on features that it believes creators really want, namely sharp, high-quality 4K 60 fps that won't fill up your hard drive (along with fast and precise autofocus, of course). It also prioritized speed with the partially stacked shutter in order to reduce rolling shutter for full-frame video. The company has a point that while RAW video provides extra quality, a single minute can take up gigabytes of space and requires a powerful PC for processing. That said, I'd personally like to have a 6K or 7K capture option in case I need to reframe a shot or output high-resolution vertical video. However, the A7 V can kind of do that itself with its Auto Framing mode that keeps a human in the scene and crops in on them automatically, like robotic cameraperson. With all the extra speed, the A7 V can shoot 30 fps blackout-free RAW bursts with accurate AF and auto exposure in electronic shutter mode (with 14-bit RAW quality rather than 12-bit as before), or 10 fps with the mechanical shutter. There's no fully uncompressed RAW option, but it does support lossless compressed RAW and a new lightweight RAW format. It also supports extended RAW processing on PC with high-resolution output, along with 12 creative look presets with custom parameters. With the new sensor and image processor, Sony is promising precise AF down to EV-4.0 in low light conditions, with 759 phase-detection points that cover about 94 percent of the image area. It also supports pre-capture and speed boost so you won't miss important moments in wildlife or sports photography. In terms of AI recognition, it now supports Human, Animal, Bird, Insect, Car/Train and Airplane detection, along with Auto Recognition of the target. Sony The A7 V's five-axis in-body stabilization delivers up to 7.5 stops of shake reduction, compared to 8.5 for Canon and Panasonic's latest models. It offers both Active and Dynamic Active modes depending on how energetically you're handling the camera, with the latter introducing some cropping. The 2.1-million-dot rear display flips out for vloggers as before, but also tilts up and down for easier hip-level photography. The OLED electronic viewfinder has the same 3.69-million dot resolution as the A7 IV. Battery life via Sony's NP-FZ100 battery stretches out to 750 shots (CIPA), the best of any camera in this category. Rather than the dual-dual card slot configuration of the A1 II, the A7 V offers a hybrid CFexpress Type A (that only Sony uses) and SD UHS II slot, along with single SD UHS II slot. Other features include 3.5mm mic and headphone ports, a full-sized HDMI port, Wi-Fi 6 and two USB-C ports. With the extra speed, high resolution compared to rivals and gain in picture quality, Sony's A7 V should appeal to hybrid shooters who focus on photography and so some video. It's now on pre-order starting at $2,899 ($3,099 with a kit lens) or $3,699/$3,899 CAD. It's due to start shipping on December 18, 2025, but only in limited numbers to start with.

          "title": "Ascentra Labs raises $2 million to help consultants use AI instead of all-night Excel marathons",
          "standfirst": "While artificial intelligence has stormed into law firms and accounting practices with billion-dollar startups like Harvey leading the charge, the global consulting industry—a $250 billion behemoth—has remained stubbornly analog. A London-based startup founded by former McKinsey consultants is betting $2 million that it can crack open this resistant market, one Excel spreadsheet at a time.Ascentra Labs announced Tuesday that it has closed a $2 million seed round led by NAP, a Berlin-based venture capital firm formerly known as Cavalry Ventures. The funding comes with participation from notable founder-angels including Alan Chang, chief executive of Fuse and former chief revenue officer at Revolut, and Fredrik Hjelm, chief executive of European e-scooter company Voi.The investment is modest by the standards of enterprise AI — a sector that has seen funding rounds routinely reach into the hundreds of millions. But Ascentra&#x27;s founders argue that their focused approach to a narrow but painful problem could give them an edge in a market where broad AI solutions have repeatedly failed to gain traction.Consultants spend countless hours on Excel survey analysis that even top firms haven&#x27;t automatedParitosh Devbhandari, Ascentra&#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, spent years at McKinsey & Company, including a stint at QuantumBlack, the firm&#x27;s AI and advanced analytics division. He knows intimately the late nights consultants spend wrestling with survey data—the kind of quantitative research that forms the backbone of private equity due diligence.\"Before starting the company, I was working at McKinsey, specifically on the private equity team,\" Devbhandari explained in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. The work, he said, involves analyzing encoded survey responses from customers, suppliers, and market participants during potential acquisitions.\"Consultants typically spend a lot of time doing this in Excel,\" he said. \"One of the things that surprised me, having worked at a couple of different places, is that the workflow — even at the best firms — really isn&#x27;t that different from some of the boutiques. I always expected there would be some smarter way of doing things, and often there just isn&#x27;t.\"That gap between expectation and reality became the foundation for Ascentra. The company&#x27;s platform ingests raw survey data files and outputs formatted Excel workbooks complete with traceable formulas — the kind of deliverable a junior associate would spend hours constructing manually.AI has transformed legal work but consulting presents unique technical challenges that have blocked adoptionThe disparity between AI adoption in law versus consulting raises an obvious question: if the consulting market is so large and the workflows so manual, why hasn&#x27;t venture capital flooded the space the way it has legal tech?Devbhandari offered a frank assessment. \"It&#x27;s not like people haven&#x27;t tried,\" he said. \"The top of the funnel in our space is crowded. When we speak to our consulting clients, the partners say they get another pitch deck in their LinkedIn inbox or email every week—sometimes several. There are plenty of people trying.\"The barriers, he argued, are structural. Professional services firms move slowly on technology adoption, demanding extensive security credentials and customer references before granting even a pilot opportunity. \"I think that&#x27;s where 90% of startups in professional services, writ large, fall down,\" he said.But consulting presents unique technical challenges beyond the sales cycle. Unlike legal work, which largely involves text documents that modern large language models handle well, consulting spans multiple data modalities — PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents — with information that can be tabular, graphical, or textual.\"You can have multiple formats of Excel in itself,\" Devbhandari noted. \"And that&#x27;s a big contrast to the legal space, where you could have a multi-purpose AI agent, or collection of agents, which can actually do a lot of the tasks that lawyers do day to day. Consulting is the opposite of that.\"Ascentra&#x27;s private equity focus reflects a calculated bet on repeatable workflowsAscentra&#x27;s strategy hinges on extreme specificity. Rather than attempting to automate the full spectrum of consulting work, the company focuses exclusively on survey analysis within private equity due diligence — a niche within a niche.The logic is both technical and commercial. Private equity work tends to be more standardized than other consulting engagements, with similar analyses recurring across deals. That repeatability makes automation feasible. It also positions Ascentra against a less formidable competitive set: even the largest consulting firms, Devbhandari claimed, lack dedicated internal tools for this particular workflow.\"Survey analysis automation is so specific that even the biggest and best firms haven&#x27;t developed anything in-house for it,\" he said.The company claims that three of the world&#x27;s top five consulting firms now use its platform, with early adopters reporting time savings of 60 to 80 percent on active due diligence projects. But there&#x27;s a notable caveat: Ascentra cannot publicly name any of these clients.\"It&#x27;s a very private industry, so at the moment, we can&#x27;t announce any clients publicly,\" Devbhandari acknowledged. \"What I can say is that we&#x27;re working with three of the top five consulting firms. We&#x27;ve passed pilots at multiple organizations and have submitted business cases for enterprise rollouts.\"Eliminating AI hallucinations becomes critical when billion-dollar deals hang in the balanceFor an AI company selling into quantitative workflows, accuracy is existential. Consultants delivering analysis to private equity clients face enormous pressure to be precise—a single error in a financial model can undermine credibility and, potentially, billion-dollar investment decisions.Devbhandari described this as Ascentra&#x27;s central design challenge. \"Consultants require a very, very high degree of fidelity when they&#x27;re doing their analysis,\" he said. \"So with quantitative data, even if it&#x27;s 95% accurate, they will revert to Excel because they know it, they trust it, and they don&#x27;t want there to be any margin for error.\"Ascentra&#x27;s technical approach attempts to address this by limiting where AI models operate within the workflow. The company uses GPT-based models from OpenAI to interpret and ingest incoming data, but the actual analysis relies on deterministic Python scripts that produce consistent, verifiable outputs.\"What&#x27;s different is the steps that follow are deterministic,\" Devbhandari explained. \"There&#x27;s no room for error. There&#x27;s no hallucinations, and the Excel writer that we&#x27;ve connected to the product on the back end converts this analysis into Excel formula, which are live and traceable, so consultants can get that assurance that they can follow along with the maths.\"Whether this hybrid approach delivers on its promise of eliminating hallucinations while maintaining useful AI capabilities will be tested as the platform scales across more complex use cases and client environments.Enterprise security certifications give Ascentra an edge over less prepared competitorsSelling software to major consulting firms requires clearing an unusually high security bar. These organizations handle sensitive client data across industries, and their vendor security assessments can take months to complete.Ascentra invested early in obtaining enterprise-grade certifications, a strategic choice that Devbhandari framed as essential table stakes. The company has achieved SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications and claims to be under audit for ISO 42001, an emerging standard for AI management systems.Data handling policies also reflect the sensitivity of the target market. Client data is deleted within 30 to 45 days, depending on contractual terms, and Ascentra does not use customer data to train its models.There&#x27;s also an argument that survey data carries somewhat lower sensitivity than other consulting materials. \"Survey data is unique in consulting data because it&#x27;s collected during the course of a project, and it is market data,\" Devbhandari noted. \"You interview people in the market, and you collect a bunch of data in an Excel, as opposed to—you look at Rogo or some of the other finance AI startups—they use client data, so financials, which is confidential and strictly non-public.\"Per-project pricing aligns with how consulting firms actually spend moneyAscentra&#x27;s pricing model departs from the subscription-based approach that dominates enterprise software. The company charges on a per-project basis, a structure Devbhandari said aligns with how consulting firms allocate budgets.\"Project budgets are in consulting set on a per project basis,\" he explained. \"You&#x27;ll have central budgets which are for things like Microsoft, right, very central things that every team will use all of the time. And then you have project budgets which are for the teams that are using specific resources, teams or products nowadays.\"This approach may ease initial adoption by avoiding the need for central IT procurement approval, but it also introduces revenue unpredictability. The company&#x27;s success will depend on converting project-level usage into broader enterprise relationships—a path Devbhandari suggested is already underway through submitted business cases for enterprise rollouts.AI may not eliminate consulting jobs, but it will fundamentally transform what consultants doPerhaps the most interesting tension in Devbhandari&#x27;s vision concerns what AI ultimately means for consulting employment. He pushed back on predictions that AI will eliminate consulting jobs while simultaneously describing an industry on the cusp of fundamental transformation.\"People love to talk about how AI is going to remove the need for consultants, and I disagree,\" he said. \"Yes, the role will change, but I don&#x27;t think the industry goes away. I think the best solutions will come from people within the industry building products around the work they know.\"Yet he also painted a picture of dramatic change. \"At the moment, you have a big intake of graduates who just do—for the most part, you know, they have the strategic work as part of what they do, but they also have a lot of work in Excel and PowerPoint. I think in a few years&#x27; time, we&#x27;ll look back at these times and think, you know, very, very different.\"The honest answer, he acknowledged, is that no one truly knows how this plays out. \"I don&#x27;t think even AI leaders truly know what that looks like yet,\" he said of whether productivity gains will translate to more work or fewer workers.Ascentra plans to use seed funding to expand its U.S. presence and go-to-market teamThe $2 million will primarily fund Ascentra&#x27;s expansion into the United States, where more than 80 percent of its customers are already based. Devbhandari plans to relocate there personally as the company builds out go-to-market capabilities.\"One of the things that we&#x27;ve really noticed is that with consulting being an American industry, and I think America being a great place for innovation and trying new things, we&#x27;ve definitely drawn ourselves to the U.S.,\" he said. \"American hires are very expensive, and I&#x27;m sure that a lot of the raise will go towards that.\"The seed round represents a bet by NAP on what its co-founder Stefan Walter called an overdue disruption. \"While most knowledge work has been reshaped by new technology, consulting has remained stubbornly manual,\" Walter said. \"AI won&#x27;t replace consultants, but consultants using Ascentra might.\"The startup now faces the hard work of converting pilot wins into lasting enterprise contractsAscentra enters 2026 with momentum but no guarantee of success. The company must transform pilot programs at elite firms into sticky enterprise contracts — all while fending off the inevitable well-funded competitors who will flood into the space once the opportunity becomes undeniable. Its deliberately narrow focus on survey analysis provides a defensible beachhead, but expanding into adjacent workflows will require building entirely new products without sacrificing the domain expertise that Devbhandari argues is the company&#x27;s core advantage.Oliver Thurston, Ascentra&#x27;s co-founder and chief technology officer, who previously led machine learning at Mathison AI, offered a clear-eyed assessment of the challenge. \"Consulting workflows are uniquely complex and difficult to build products around,\" he said in a statement. \"It&#x27;s not surprising the space hasn&#x27;t changed yet. This will change though, and there&#x27;s no doubt that the industry is going to look completely different in five years&#x27; time.\"For now, Ascentra is placing a focused wager: that the consultants who once spent their nights formatting spreadsheets will be the ones who finally bring AI into an industry that has long resisted it. The irony is hard to miss. After years of advising Fortune 500 companies on digital transformation, consulting may finally have to take its own medicine.",
          "content": "While artificial intelligence has stormed into law firms and accounting practices with billion-dollar startups like Harvey leading the charge, the global consulting industry—a $250 billion behemoth—has remained stubbornly analog. A London-based startup founded by former McKinsey consultants is betting $2 million that it can crack open this resistant market, one Excel spreadsheet at a time.Ascentra Labs announced Tuesday that it has closed a $2 million seed round led by NAP, a Berlin-based venture capital firm formerly known as Cavalry Ventures. The funding comes with participation from notable founder-angels including Alan Chang, chief executive of Fuse and former chief revenue officer at Revolut, and Fredrik Hjelm, chief executive of European e-scooter company Voi.The investment is modest by the standards of enterprise AI — a sector that has seen funding rounds routinely reach into the hundreds of millions. But Ascentra&#x27;s founders argue that their focused approach to a narrow but painful problem could give them an edge in a market where broad AI solutions have repeatedly failed to gain traction.Consultants spend countless hours on Excel survey analysis that even top firms haven&#x27;t automatedParitosh Devbhandari, Ascentra&#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, spent years at McKinsey & Company, including a stint at QuantumBlack, the firm&#x27;s AI and advanced analytics division. He knows intimately the late nights consultants spend wrestling with survey data—the kind of quantitative research that forms the backbone of private equity due diligence.\"Before starting the company, I was working at McKinsey, specifically on the private equity team,\" Devbhandari explained in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. The work, he said, involves analyzing encoded survey responses from customers, suppliers, and market participants during potential acquisitions.\"Consultants typically spend a lot of time doing this in Excel,\" he said. \"One of the things that surprised me, having worked at a couple of different places, is that the workflow — even at the best firms — really isn&#x27;t that different from some of the boutiques. I always expected there would be some smarter way of doing things, and often there just isn&#x27;t.\"That gap between expectation and reality became the foundation for Ascentra. The company&#x27;s platform ingests raw survey data files and outputs formatted Excel workbooks complete with traceable formulas — the kind of deliverable a junior associate would spend hours constructing manually.AI has transformed legal work but consulting presents unique technical challenges that have blocked adoptionThe disparity between AI adoption in law versus consulting raises an obvious question: if the consulting market is so large and the workflows so manual, why hasn&#x27;t venture capital flooded the space the way it has legal tech?Devbhandari offered a frank assessment. \"It&#x27;s not like people haven&#x27;t tried,\" he said. \"The top of the funnel in our space is crowded. When we speak to our consulting clients, the partners say they get another pitch deck in their LinkedIn inbox or email every week—sometimes several. There are plenty of people trying.\"The barriers, he argued, are structural. Professional services firms move slowly on technology adoption, demanding extensive security credentials and customer references before granting even a pilot opportunity. \"I think that&#x27;s where 90% of startups in professional services, writ large, fall down,\" he said.But consulting presents unique technical challenges beyond the sales cycle. Unlike legal work, which largely involves text documents that modern large language models handle well, consulting spans multiple data modalities — PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents — with information that can be tabular, graphical, or textual.\"You can have multiple formats of Excel in itself,\" Devbhandari noted. \"And that&#x27;s a big contrast to the legal space, where you could have a multi-purpose AI agent, or collection of agents, which can actually do a lot of the tasks that lawyers do day to day. Consulting is the opposite of that.\"Ascentra&#x27;s private equity focus reflects a calculated bet on repeatable workflowsAscentra&#x27;s strategy hinges on extreme specificity. Rather than attempting to automate the full spectrum of consulting work, the company focuses exclusively on survey analysis within private equity due diligence — a niche within a niche.The logic is both technical and commercial. Private equity work tends to be more standardized than other consulting engagements, with similar analyses recurring across deals. That repeatability makes automation feasible. It also positions Ascentra against a less formidable competitive set: even the largest consulting firms, Devbhandari claimed, lack dedicated internal tools for this particular workflow.\"Survey analysis automation is so specific that even the biggest and best firms haven&#x27;t developed anything in-house for it,\" he said.The company claims that three of the world&#x27;s top five consulting firms now use its platform, with early adopters reporting time savings of 60 to 80 percent on active due diligence projects. But there&#x27;s a notable caveat: Ascentra cannot publicly name any of these clients.\"It&#x27;s a very private industry, so at the moment, we can&#x27;t announce any clients publicly,\" Devbhandari acknowledged. \"What I can say is that we&#x27;re working with three of the top five consulting firms. We&#x27;ve passed pilots at multiple organizations and have submitted business cases for enterprise rollouts.\"Eliminating AI hallucinations becomes critical when billion-dollar deals hang in the balanceFor an AI company selling into quantitative workflows, accuracy is existential. Consultants delivering analysis to private equity clients face enormous pressure to be precise—a single error in a financial model can undermine credibility and, potentially, billion-dollar investment decisions.Devbhandari described this as Ascentra&#x27;s central design challenge. \"Consultants require a very, very high degree of fidelity when they&#x27;re doing their analysis,\" he said. \"So with quantitative data, even if it&#x27;s 95% accurate, they will revert to Excel because they know it, they trust it, and they don&#x27;t want there to be any margin for error.\"Ascentra&#x27;s technical approach attempts to address this by limiting where AI models operate within the workflow. The company uses GPT-based models from OpenAI to interpret and ingest incoming data, but the actual analysis relies on deterministic Python scripts that produce consistent, verifiable outputs.\"What&#x27;s different is the steps that follow are deterministic,\" Devbhandari explained. \"There&#x27;s no room for error. There&#x27;s no hallucinations, and the Excel writer that we&#x27;ve connected to the product on the back end converts this analysis into Excel formula, which are live and traceable, so consultants can get that assurance that they can follow along with the maths.\"Whether this hybrid approach delivers on its promise of eliminating hallucinations while maintaining useful AI capabilities will be tested as the platform scales across more complex use cases and client environments.Enterprise security certifications give Ascentra an edge over less prepared competitorsSelling software to major consulting firms requires clearing an unusually high security bar. These organizations handle sensitive client data across industries, and their vendor security assessments can take months to complete.Ascentra invested early in obtaining enterprise-grade certifications, a strategic choice that Devbhandari framed as essential table stakes. The company has achieved SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications and claims to be under audit for ISO 42001, an emerging standard for AI management systems.Data handling policies also reflect the sensitivity of the target market. Client data is deleted within 30 to 45 days, depending on contractual terms, and Ascentra does not use customer data to train its models.There&#x27;s also an argument that survey data carries somewhat lower sensitivity than other consulting materials. \"Survey data is unique in consulting data because it&#x27;s collected during the course of a project, and it is market data,\" Devbhandari noted. \"You interview people in the market, and you collect a bunch of data in an Excel, as opposed to—you look at Rogo or some of the other finance AI startups—they use client data, so financials, which is confidential and strictly non-public.\"Per-project pricing aligns with how consulting firms actually spend moneyAscentra&#x27;s pricing model departs from the subscription-based approach that dominates enterprise software.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday has come and gone, but the deals are here to stay — at least, some of them are for now. It’s been a few years since Cyber Monday deals truly wrapped up at midnight, and this year we’re seeing a ton of great deals still available now that the official day has wrapped. Tech deals have been decent this year, with big discounts on headphones, earbuds, game consoles, laptops, kitchen gadgets and more. If you’re still hoping to save on some items for yourself or as gifts for the holidays, we’ve got you covered. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals on tech that are still available today. Best Cyber Monday deals still available Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple AirPods 4 for $80 ($50 off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $449 ($50 off): As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Walmart currently has the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that you must be signed into a Walmart account and add the item to your cart in order to see the discounted price. There's no telling how long this deal will last. PlayStation 5 standard edition for $449 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles, particularly the digital edition, go in and out of stock as of late. However, it has come back eventually at retailers like Amazon. If you see the model you want listed as out of stock, it's worth it to check back in an hour or two to see if that's changed. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Cyber Monday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $34 (31 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $59 (50 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-on-tech-for-2025-that-are-still-available-the-best-sales-up-to-75-percent-off-on-streaming-services-gaming-accessories-and-more-170028972.html?src=rss",

Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Cyber Monday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $34 (31 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $59 (50 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-on-tech-for-2025-that-are-still-available-the-best-sales-up-to-75-percent-off-on-streaming-services-gaming-accessories-and-more-170028972.html?src=rss",

Unlike the early trifold from Huawei, the smartphone has an inward-folding display meant to protect the wider main display, 10 inches wide. The cover screen is 6.5 inches when folded, while the entire TriFold is 12.9mm when collapsed and 3.9mm at its thinnest when unfolded. Engadget That might seem a bit chunky in the face of super-thin smartphones, but it’s much thinner than Samsung’s first Z Fold (17.1mm), back in 2019. Arguably, it’s a 10-inch tablet (with the right screen ratio) crammed into a smartphone form factor. The phone runs on a custom Snapdragon 8 chip, with a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery and support for 45W super-fast charging.

The service features courses led by industry leaders who share practical insights drawn from their own careers. Whether you want to cook with Gordon Ramsay, explore storytelling with Neil Gaiman or study filmmaking with Martin Scorsese, the range of topics is broad enough to appeal to almost any interest.

It’s not just about inspiration; the platform’s focus on actionable advice makes it a practical choice for anyone who wants to pick up new skills or refresh existing ones.

New subscribers can get two months of service for $6 total, and the price applies to either the Essential or Premium plan. At $3 per month, the Premium tier gives you a larger discount, and the promotion is available through December 2. Paramount+ continues to expand its catalog with a mix of current CBS shows, exclusive originals, classic TV and live sports. The service is available in two main tiers: Essential, which includes ads, and Premium, which removes most of them and adds a few key extras like 4K streaming, offline downloads and live CBS access. Both tiers include select Showtime programming, giving subscribers a taste of the premium network’s lineup. The Essential plan provides access to more than 40,000 episodes and movies, along with live coverage of the NFL on CBS and UEFA Champions League matches. It supports up to three simultaneous streams, making it a practical choice for households that share accounts. The Premium plan builds on that by offering ad-free on-demand viewing (with exceptions for live broadcasts), higher-quality playback and the option to watch CBS live in participating regions. Paramount+’s growing library combines new releases with well-known favorites, offering titles from across CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Sports fans get live coverage of key events, while movie watchers can find recent cinema releases from Paramount Pictures joining the lineup throughout the year. The inclusion of Showtime series in both plans adds another layer of variety, with dramas and documentaries available alongside the core Paramount+ content. If you’re keeping an eye on subscription costs, an offer like this is a practical way to test the service without paying full price. It also gives you time to see whether the Essential plan’s ad-supported setup or the Premium tier’s extras are worth the difference. If you’ve been watching your streaming spend as prices go up elsewhere, this deal from Paramount+ offers a well-balanced opportunity to experience both plan levels at a lower cost. Paramount+ is one of the best streaming services thanks to its vast selection of original shows like Star Trek: Discovery, Ink Master and Frasier. If you’re ready to stream big shows and live events without a heavy commitment this Cyber Monday offer is one to keep in mind.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-paramount-cyber-monday-streaming-deal-is-still-live-get-either-the-essential-or-premium-plan-for-only-3-per-month-for-two-months-before-the-sale-ends-192516088.html?src=rss",

Wireless chargers make it simple to top up your phone, earbuds or smartwatch by just setting them down, which is especially useful if you’re tired of frayed cables or worn-out ports.

Wireless charging performance Quality and box contents Wireless chargers FAQs Best wireless chargers for 2025 What to look for in a wireless charger While it’s tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a 3-in-1 wireless charger or full wireless charging station. Where and how will you use your charger? Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours. For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space. Wireless charging performance Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility. In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones. There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple’s latest MagSafe charging pad can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter — the latter being another component you’ll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can. Quality and box contents Pay attention to what’s included in the box. Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link. Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs. You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station. Wireless chargers FAQs Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case? Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported. How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging? Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.” Do cords charge your phone faster? Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",

          "title": "AWS goes beyond prompt-level safety with automated reasoning in AgentCore",
          "standfirst": "AWS is leveraging automated reasoning, which uses math-based verification, to build out new capabilities in its Amazon Bedrock AgentCore platform as the company digs deeper into the agentic AI ecosystem. Announced during its annual re: Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS is adding three new capabilities to AgentCore: \"policy,\" \"evaluations\" and \"episodic memory.\" The new features aim to give enterprises more control over agent behavior and performance. AWS also revealed what it calls “a new class of agents,\" or \"frontier agents,\" that are autonomous, scalable and independent. Swami Sivasubramanian, AWS VP for Agentic AI, told VentureBeat that many of AWS’s new features represent a shift in who becomes a builder. “We are actually on the cusp of a major tectonic transformation with AI, but agentic AI is truly starting to transform what is the art of the possible, and it is going to make this one of the most truly transforming technologies,” Sivasubramanian said. Policy agentsThe new policy capability helps enterprises reinforce guidelines even after the agent has already reasoned its response. AWS VP for AgentCore David Richardson told VentureBeat that the policy tool sits between the agent and the tools it calls, rather than being baked into the agent, as fine-tuning often is. The idea is to prevent an agent from violating enterprise rules and redirect it to re-evaluate its reasoning. Richardson gave the example of a customer service agent: A company would write a policy stating that the agent can grant a refund of up to $100, but for anything higher, the agent would need to bounce the customer to a human. He noted that it remains easy to subvert an agent&#x27;s reasoning loop through, for instance, prompt injection or poisoned data, leading agents to ignore guardrails. “There are always these prompt injection attacks where people try to subvert the reasoning of the agent to get the agent to do things it shouldn’t do,” Richardson said. “That’s why we implemented the policy outside of the agent, and it works using the automated reasoning capabilities that we’ve spent years building up to help customer define their capabilities.”AWS unveiled Automated Reasoning Checks on Bedrock at last year’s re: Invent. These use neurosymbolic AI, or math-based validation, to prove correctness. The tool applies mathematical proofs to models to confirm that it hasn’t hallucinated. AWS has been leaning heavily into neurosymbolic AI and automated reasoning, pushing for enterprise-grade security and safety in ways that differ from other AI model providers.Episodic memories and evaluationsThe two other new updates to AgentCore, \"evaluations\" and \"episodic memory,\" also give enterprises a better view of agent performance and give agents episodic memory.An enhancement of AgentCore memory, episodic memory refers to knowledge that agents tap into only occasionally, unlike longer-running preferences, which they have to refer back to constantly. Context window limits hamper some agents, so they sometimes forget information or conversations they haven’t tapped into for a while. “The idea is to help capture information that a user really would wish the agent remembered when they came back,\" said Richardson. \"For example, &#x27;what is their preferred seat on an airplane for family trips?&#x27; Or &#x27;what is the sort of price range they&#x27;re looking for?&#x27;\"Episodic memory differs from the previously shipped AgentCore memory because, instead of relying on maintaining short- and long-term memory, agents built on AgentCore can recall certain information based on triggers. This can eliminate the need for custom instructions.With AgentCore evaluations, organizations can use 13 pre-built evaluators or write their own. Developers can set alerts to warn them if agents begin to fail quality monitoring.Frontier agentsBut perhaps AWS&#x27;s strongest push into enterprise agentic AI is the release of frontier agents, or fully automated and independent agents that the company says can act as teammates with little direction. The concept is similar, if not identical, to those of more asynchronous agents from competitors like Google and OpenAI. However, AWS seems to be releasing more than just autonomous coding agents. Sivasubramanian called them a \"new class\" of agents, \"not only a step function change in what you can do today; they move from assisting with individual tasks to complex projects.\"The first is Kiro, an autonomous coding agent that has been in public preview since July. At the time, Kiro was billed as an alternative to vibe coding platforms like OpenAI’s Codex or Windsurf. Similar to Codex and Google’s myriad asynchronous coding agents, including Jules, Kiro can code, undertake reviews, fix bugs independently and determine the tasks it needs to accomplish. AWS security agent, meanwhile, embeds deep security expertise into applications from the start. The company said in a press release that users “define security standards once and AWS security agent automatically validates them across your applications during its review — helping teams address the risks that matter to their business, not generic checklists.”The AWS DevOps agent will help developers, especially those on call, proactively find system breaks or bugs. It can respond to incidents using its knowledge of the application or service. It also acknowledges the relationships between the application and the tools it taps, such as Amazon CloudWatch, Datadog and Splunk, to trace the root cause of the issue. Enterprises are interested in deploying agents and, eventually, bringing more autonomous agents into their workflows. And, while companies like AWS continue to bolster these agents with security and control, organizations are slowly figuring out how to connect them all.",

          "title": "With AI browsers creating fresh security and privacy concerns, Norton Neo is the first to enter with a safety-first approach",
          "standfirst": "The AI browser wars are heating up. OpenAI and other AI companies like Perplexity have gotten a lot of attention with their new AI-first and agentic browsers. They&#x27;re being positioned as direct competition to Google, which currently holds a 70% share of the market with its Chrome browser. As the incumbent, Google has been slower to respond to the shift toward AI search — integrating Gemini into Chrome, is widely seen as playing catch-up to competitors that were AI-first from day one.It&#x27;s understandable, as a $100 billion business is an enormous, unwieldy beast to pivot. That leaves space for the new guys to maneuver, who are essentially starting with blank slates, and free reign for innovation.Enter Neo, released for worldwide general availability today — the next step in Norton’s AI innovation journey, building on its leadership in cyber safety and its bid to deliver the world’s first safe, zero-prompt AI browser. From the beginning, the minds behind Neo made a deliberate choice to focus on a proactive AI assistant rather than chase today’s agentic trends. Even enthusiasts willing to tolerate the risks face too much unpredictability, along with new safety and privacy concerns.Howie Xu, chief AI & innovation officer at Gen, describes Neo as a browser built to help before you ask — delivering on-page, in-flow support through summaries, reminders, and context-aware suggestions without prompts or extra steps.\"It&#x27;s like having a highly intelligent assistant sitting next to me, helping me absorb and process information much more broadly, much faster, much deeper,\" Xu says. \"That assistant is there when you&#x27;re reading, when you&#x27;re researching, when you&#x27;re working on an online project. And based on your interests and browsing, your assistant can help you at every step.\"Borrowing from Norton&#x27;s unique consumer security expertise, privacy and safety has also been integrated from the ground up.\"What makes us unique is that we&#x27;re giving people both peace of mind and AI functionality at the same time,\" Xu explains. \"Norton’s roots are in security. We’re the only game in town that built an AI native browser from the ground up with safety and privacy at its core —one that won’t exploit or use your data for training.The zero-prompt differenceComet (Perplexity) and Atlas (OpenAI) were built by chat-first companies that assume users will actively ask questions. But getting value from AI takes cognitive effort: you need to know what to ask, shift into “question mode,” and understand what the model can actually do. Asking a question isn’t the hard part; realizing what to ask requires meta-cognition — awareness of what you don’t know — which makes turning to ChatGPT in the middle of browsing feel harder than it should.Neo takes the opposite approach. Instead of waiting for you to prompt it, it acts first — offering summaries, reminders, relevant news, and even questions you’re likely to explore. \"Based on my browsing interests, Neo reminds me of events I might want to attend, surfaces personalized news, and presents pre-generated questions that I actually want to explore,\" Xu explains. \"In other words, I’ve never had to formulate a single prompt — I’m simply clicking on insights the AI has already anticipated for me as if I had been prompting.”Because most people don’t know the boundaries of AI technology or how to phrase effective prompts, expecting them to drive the interaction is unrealistic for many people.\"We decided to shift the burden away from people. You can still ask questions, of course, but we’re designing for those who want less cognitive load and prefer AI to take the first step,\" he says. Much like the recommendations that surface on any news or retail site, Neo leverages browsing context to surface the right content at the right moment.Neo can summarize a page and anticipate questions based on your interests and behaviors. With permission, it can also create detailed reminders — for example, noticing repeat visits to Formula 1 websites and prompting you about upcoming races. Control stays with the person using Neo: if an interest fades, they can remove it from Neo’s Configurable Memory.Because Neo’s browsing history and preferences are stored locally and securely, it can customize prompts, insights, and suggestions — from calendar nudges to news recommendations to suggested questions in the Neo Chat interface. The result is an AI-powered browser that gives people the benefits of AI without typing prompts. Inline actions like “Summary,” “Add to calendar?,” “Resume where you left off,” and “Price dropped” make browsing feel faster and lighter, without extra steps.A calm-by-design experience grounded in security“Calm by design” has guided Neo’s development, and for Xu that comes down to three things: control, privacy, and security, all within a clean, streamlined experience that makes browsing faster and easier.Rooted in Norton’s decades of security expertise, Neo’s calm experience starts with privacy and protection. Xu views it as the bedrock of Neo’s approach: the company never knows what you’re doing, because all personal data stays on the device unless explicitly permitted otherwise. Norton-backed security practices suppress prompt-injection risks common in other AI browsers, local processing keeps sensitive information contained, and scoped sync ensures only user-approved context carries across devices.Norton also brings deep web intelligence: decades of scanning the vast majority of the internet and evolving antivirus capabilities that now understand both static and runtime web content. That real-time insight allows Neo’s built in antivirus, anti-phishing, and anti-scam technology to detect and shut down malicious behavior and content the moment it appears.\"When we think about calm, what we really mean is delivering value in a consistent way, in a reliable way, in a way that people can predict, so people have peace of mind,\" Xu says. \"This is very different from the design of the agentic browsers out there where the result is simply unpredictable, not to mention the associated latency and overhead. I believe consistency is a necessity for us to push an AI browser to a mass population. We have some flashy capabilities too, but our primary goal is that people can just use it in their daily lives without ever having to worry about all the vulnerabilities that most agentic browsers introduce. Since we&#x27;re calm, reliable and safe by design, we believe we’ll win the hearts of a mass audience.\"For anyone watching the rapid shift toward AI-powered browsing, Neo shows how Norton is fusing assistance, security, and zero-prompt design into a single experience.

But getting value from AI takes cognitive effort: you need to know what to ask, shift into “question mode,” and understand what the model can actually do. Asking a question isn’t the hard part; realizing what to ask requires meta-cognition — awareness of what you don’t know — which makes turning to ChatGPT in the middle of browsing feel harder than it should.Neo takes the opposite approach. Instead of waiting for you to prompt it, it acts first — offering summaries, reminders, relevant news, and even questions you’re likely to explore. \"Based on my browsing interests, Neo reminds me of events I might want to attend, surfaces personalized news, and presents pre-generated questions that I actually want to explore,\" Xu explains. \"In other words, I’ve never had to formulate a single prompt — I’m simply clicking on insights the AI has already anticipated for me as if I had been prompting.”Because most people don’t know the boundaries of AI technology or how to phrase effective prompts, expecting them to drive the interaction is unrealistic for many people.\"We decided to shift the burden away from people. You can still ask questions, of course, but we’re designing for those who want less cognitive load and prefer AI to take the first step,\" he says. Much like the recommendations that surface on any news or retail site, Neo leverages browsing context to surface the right content at the right moment.Neo can summarize a page and anticipate questions based on your interests and behaviors. With permission, it can also create detailed reminders — for example, noticing repeat visits to Formula 1 websites and prompting you about upcoming races. Control stays with the person using Neo: if an interest fades, they can remove it from Neo’s Configurable Memory.Because Neo’s browsing history and preferences are stored locally and securely, it can customize prompts, insights, and suggestions — from calendar nudges to news recommendations to suggested questions in the Neo Chat interface. The result is an AI-powered browser that gives people the benefits of AI without typing prompts. Inline actions like “Summary,” “Add to calendar?,” “Resume where you left off,” and “Price dropped” make browsing feel faster and lighter, without extra steps.A calm-by-design experience grounded in security“Calm by design” has guided Neo’s development, and for Xu that comes down to three things: control, privacy, and security, all within a clean, streamlined experience that makes browsing faster and easier.Rooted in Norton’s decades of security expertise, Neo’s calm experience starts with privacy and protection. Xu views it as the bedrock of Neo’s approach: the company never knows what you’re doing, because all personal data stays on the device unless explicitly permitted otherwise. Norton-backed security practices suppress prompt-injection risks common in other AI browsers, local processing keeps sensitive information contained, and scoped sync ensures only user-approved context carries across devices.Norton also brings deep web intelligence: decades of scanning the vast majority of the internet and evolving antivirus capabilities that now understand both static and runtime web content. That real-time insight allows Neo’s built in antivirus, anti-phishing, and anti-scam technology to detect and shut down malicious behavior and content the moment it appears.\"When we think about calm, what we really mean is delivering value in a consistent way, in a reliable way, in a way that people can predict, so people have peace of mind,\" Xu says. \"This is very different from the design of the agentic browsers out there where the result is simply unpredictable, not to mention the associated latency and overhead. I believe consistency is a necessity for us to push an AI browser to a mass population. We have some flashy capabilities too, but our primary goal is that people can just use it in their daily lives without ever having to worry about all the vulnerabilities that most agentic browsers introduce. Since we&#x27;re calm, reliable and safe by design, we believe we’ll win the hearts of a mass audience.\"For anyone watching the rapid shift toward AI-powered browsing, Neo shows how Norton is fusing assistance, security, and zero-prompt design into a single experience.

          "standfirst": "Update, December 2, 2025: The Disney+ Hulu bundle deal has expired for the year, but there are a number of other Cyber Monday streaming deals still available, including ones from Paramount+, Starz and Audible. For Cyber Monday, Disney is offering the Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle for just $5 a month for one year. That means you can pay $60, less than the price of taking your family to the movies, and get a year's worth of entertainment. The deal is available to both new and returning subscribers, and include access to all of the biggest hits in Disney's catalog, whether its Star Wars or Only Murders in the Building. But you only have a bit more time to take advantage of this offer — it runs through the end of the day December 1. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads.

          "standfirst": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is leaning into the growing trend toward custom models with a new service that it says will let enterprises bring more personalization and internal knowledge. The move comes alongside the release of AWS&#x27;s new models as part of its Nova family, which expands the capabilities of its reasoning models.Nova 2 Lite, Nova 2 Pro, Nova 2 Sonic and Nova 2 Omni update the first Nova models AWS announced last year.Nova 2 Lite is a fast, cost-effective reasoning model optimized for everyday tasks that can process text, images and videos to generate text. Nova 2 Pro, which AWS said is its most intelligent reasoning model, can handle complex tasks such as coding agents, long-range planning and problem-solving. It can act as a “teacher” model for distillation projects. Nova 2 Sonic is a speech-to-speech model, while Nova 2 Omni enables organizations to generate both text and images from text, image and video inputs. Nova Act, AWS&#x27;s browser agent — announced as an experimental development kit in April — is also powered by the Nova 2 models and now available to customers. However, it is the custom model service, Nova Forge, that AWS is most excited about. The service gives customers the ability to introduce proprietary data to a pre-trained model without fear that the model will forget its previous training. Nova Forge allows enterprises to create custom, optimized versions of Nova models, which it calls “Novellas,” and bring them directly to its Amazon Bedrock platform. Custom model creation Enterprises are increasingly turning to model distillation or custom models, especially with many industries choosing to create foundation models with domain-specific knowledge. But these can often be out of reach for many companies, as not everyone can afford several Nvidia GPU H100s to build models from scratch. As a result, they turn to heavily fine-tuned open-source off-the-shelf models. “You just don&#x27;t have a great way to get a frontier model that deeply understands your data and your domain,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman said during his keynote speech at AWS’s annual re: Invent conference. \"But what if it was possible? What if you could integrate your data at the right time during the training of a frontier model, then create a proprietary model that was just for you?” Nova Forge employs what AWS calls “open training,” which allows developers to blend their proprietary data with an Amazon-curated dataset at every step of model development, with checkpoints during training. AWS said this means models will not regress on foundational capabilities, such as instruction following, while learning company-specific knowledge and instructions. Each “Novella” could be a custom version of Nova 2 Lite, with Nova’s full knowledge and reasoning power, but with domain-specificity. Right now, enterprises can only make Novellas from Nova 2 Lite, but many will expand to other Nova 2 models soon. Nova Forge also offers enterprises “reinforcement learning gyms.\" This allows them to train AI systems through their own environments with simulated scenarios to create smaller, faster models and access responsible AI toolkits. Once companies create their Novellas, they can bring them to Bedrock to build more applications and agents. One customer currently using Nova Forge is Reddit, which integrated its own data and community-specific knowledge into a model to build a moderation program. Nova Forge only works with Nova models, and AWS does not plan to bring in third-party open-source models hosted on Bedrock (for now).Nova 2 models in detailAWS said tens of thousands of companies now use its Nova models and the company expects the Nova 2 models to see the same adoption. “Nova 2 Lite delivers incredible price performance for many workloads that we actually see our customers wanting to deliver in production,” Garman said. “We think Nova 2 Lite will be the workhorse for many companies, while Pro will be for more complex tasks and for when you need your agents to be great.”In a press release, AWS said evaluations showed Nova 2 Lite performed “equal or better on 13 out of 15 benchmarks compared to Claude Haiku 4.5, equal or better on 11 out of 17 benchmarks compared to GPT-5 Mini and equal or better on 14 out of 18 benchmarks compared to Gemini Flash 2.5.”Users can adjust how much Nova 2 Lite shows its step-by-step thinking to balance costs with depth. Nova Pro 2 also performed well in benchmark testing compared to Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This model works best for multi-document analysis, video reasoning, advanced math and agentic engineering tasks. AWS said in its press release that both Nova 2 Lite and Pro “have built-in grounding and code execution capabilities.”Nova 2 Sonic, the speech-to-speech model, generates human-like conversations and now supports multiple languages. The updated model has a 1-million-token context window, with more expressive voices and higher accuracy. The company said Sonic can even switch topics mid-conversation.Nova 2 Omni handles “up to 750,000 words, hours of audio, long videos and hundred-page documents, simultaneously analyzing entire product catalogs, testimonials, brand guidelines and video libraries at once.” “While there are no comparable models in the industry to Nova 2 Omni, it demonstrates strengths in public benchmarks of multimodal reasoning on documents, images, videos and audio, and can generate high-quality images similar to other leading image-generation models,” AWS said in its release.",

          "title": "Arcee aims to reboot U.S. open source AI with new Trinity models released under Apache 2.0",
          "standfirst": "For much of 2025, the frontier of open-weight language models has been defined not in Silicon Valley or New York City, but in Beijing and Hangzhou.Chinese research labs including Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen, DeepSeek, Moonshot and Baidu have rapidly set the pace in developing large-scale, open Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models — often with permissive licenses and leading benchmark performance. While OpenAI fielded its own open source, general purpose LLM this summer as well — gpt-oss-20B and 120B — the uptake has been slowed by so many equally or better performing alternatives. Now, one small U.S. company is pushing back.Today, Arcee AI announced the release of Trinity Mini and Trinity Nano Preview, the first two models in its new “Trinity” family—an open-weight MoE model suite fully trained in the United States. Users can try the former directly for themselves in a chatbot format on Acree&#x27;s new website, chat.arcee.ai, and developers can download the code for both models on Hugging Face and run it themselves, as well as modify them/fine-tune to their liking — all for free under an enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license. While small compared to the largest frontier models, these releases represent a rare attempt by a U.S. startup to build end-to-end open-weight models at scale—trained from scratch, on American infrastructure, using a U.S.-curated dataset pipeline.\"I&#x27;m experiencing a combination of extreme pride in my team and crippling exhaustion, so I&#x27;m struggling to put into words just how excited I am to have these models out,\" wrote Arcee Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Lucas Atkins in a post on the social network X (formerly Twitter). \"Especially Mini.\"A third model, Trinity Large, is already in training: a 420B parameter model with 13B active parameters per token, scheduled to launch in January 2026.“We want to add something that has been missing in that picture,” Atkins wrote in the Trinity launch manifesto published on Arcee&#x27;s website. “A serious open weight model family trained end to end in America… that businesses and developers can actually own.”From Small Models to Scaled AmbitionThe Trinity project marks a turning point for Arcee AI, which until now has been known for its compact, enterprise-focused models. The company has raised $29.5 million in funding to date, including a $24 million Series A in 2024 led by Emergence Capital, and its previous releases include AFM-4.5B, a compact instruct-tuned model released in mid-2025, and SuperNova, an earlier 70B-parameter instruction-following model designed for in-VPC enterprise deployment. Both were aimed at solving regulatory and cost issues plaguing proprietary LLM adoption in the enterprise.With Trinity, Arcee is aiming higher: not just instruction tuning or post-training, but full-stack pretraining of open-weight foundation models—built for long-context reasoning, synthetic data adaptation, and future integration with live retraining systems.Originally conceived as a stepping stone to Trinity Large, both Mini and Nano emerged from early experimentation with sparse modeling and quickly became production targets themselves.Technical HighlightsTrinity Mini is a 26B parameter model with 3B active per token, designed for high-throughput reasoning, function calling, and tool use. Trinity Nano Preview is a 6B parameter model with roughly 800M active non-embedding parameters—a more experimental, chat-focused model with a stronger personality, but lower reasoning robustness. Both models use Arcee’s new Attention-First Mixture-of-Experts (AFMoE) architecture, a custom MoE design blending global sparsity, local/global attention, and gated attention techniques.Inspired by recent advances from DeepSeek and Qwen, AFMoE departs from traditional MoE by tightly integrating sparse expert routing with an enhanced attention stack — including grouped-query attention, gated attention, and a local/global pattern that improves long-context reasoning. Think of a typical MoE model like a call center with 128 specialized agents (called “experts”) — but only a few are consulted for each call, depending on the question. This saves time and energy, since not every expert needs to weigh in.What makes AFMoE different is how it decides which agents to call and how it blends their answers. Most MoE models use a standard approach that picks experts based on a simple ranking. AFMoE, by contrast, uses a smoother method (called sigmoid routing) that’s more like adjusting a volume dial than flipping a switch — letting the model blend multiple perspectives more gracefully.The “attention-first” part means the model focuses heavily on how it pays attention to different parts of the conversation. Imagine reading a novel and remembering some parts more clearly than others based on importance, recency, or emotional impact — that’s attention. AFMoE improves this by combining local attention (focusing on what was just said) with global attention (remembering key points from earlier), using a rhythm that keeps things balanced.Finally, AFMoE introduces something called gated attention, which acts like a volume control on each attention output — helping the model emphasize or dampen different pieces of information as needed, like adjusting how much you care about each voice in a group discussion.All of this is designed to make the model more stable during training and more efficient at scale — so it can understand longer conversations, reason more clearly, and run faster without needing massive computing resources.Unlike many existing MoE implementations, AFMoE emphasizes stability at depth and training efficiency, using techniques like sigmoid-based routing without auxiliary loss, and depth-scaled normalization to support scaling without divergence.Model CapabilitiesTrinity Mini adopts an MoE architecture with 128 experts, 8 active per token, and 1 always-on shared expert. Context windows reach up to 131,072 tokens, depending on provider. Benchmarks show Trinity Mini performing competitively with larger models across reasoning tasks, including outperforming gpt-oss on the SimpleQA benchmark (tests factual recall and whether the model admits uncertainty), MMLU (Zero shot, measuring broad academic knowledge and reasoning across many subjects without examples), and BFCL V3 (evaluates multi-step function calling and real-world tool use):MMLU (zero-shot): 84.95Math-500: 92.10GPQA-Diamond: 58.55BFCL V3: 59.67Latency and throughput numbers across providers like Together and Clarifai show 200+ tokens per second throughput with sub-three-second E2E latency—making Trinity Mini viable for interactive applications and agent pipelines.Trinity Nano, while smaller and not as stable on edge cases, demonstrates sparse MoE architecture viability at under 1B active parameters per token. Access, Pricing, and Ecosystem IntegrationBoth Trinity models are released under the permissive, enterprise-friendly, Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial and research use. Trinity Mini is available via:Hugging FaceOpenRouterchat.arcee.aiAPI pricing for Trinity Mini via OpenRouter:$0.045 per million input tokens$0.15 per million output tokensA free tier is available for a limited time on OpenRouterThe model is already integrated into apps including Benchable.ai, Open WebUI, and SillyTavern. It&#x27;s supported in Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, LM Studio, and llama.cpp.Data Without Compromise: DatologyAI’s RoleCentral to Arcee’s approach is control over training data—a sharp contrast to many open models trained on web-scraped or legally ambiguous datasets. That’s where DatologyAI, a data curation startup co-founded by former Meta and DeepMind researcher Ari Morcos, plays a critical role.DatologyAI’s platform automates data filtering, deduplication, and quality enhancement across modalities, ensuring Arcee’s training corpus avoids the pitfalls of noisy, biased, or copyright-risk content. For Trinity, DatologyAI helped construct a 10 trillion token curriculum organized into three phases: 7T general data, 1.8T high-quality text, and 1.2T STEM-heavy material, including math and code.This is the same partnership that powered Arcee’s AFM-4.5B—but scaled significantly in both size and complexity. According to Arcee, it was Datology’s filtering and data-ranking tools that allowed Trinity to scale cleanly while improving performance on tasks like mathematics, QA, and agent tool use.Datology’s contribution also extends into synthetic data generation. For Trinity Large, the company has produced over 10 trillion synthetic tokens—paired with 10T curated web tokens—to form a 20T-token training corpus for the full-scale model now in progress.Building the Infrastructure to Compete: Prime IntellectArcee’s ability to execute full-scale training in the U.S. is also thanks to its infrastructure partner, Prime Intellect. The startup, founded in early 2024, began with a mission to democratize access to AI compute by building a decentralized GPU marketplace and training stack.While Prime Intellect made headlines with its distributed training of INTELLECT-1—a 10B parameter model trained across contributors in five countries—its more recent work, including the 106B INTELLECT-3, acknowledges the tradeoffs of scale: distributed training works, but for 100B+ models, centralized infrastructure is still more efficient.For Trinity Mini and Nano, Prime Intellect supplied the orchestration stack, modified TorchTitan runtime, and physical compute environment: 512 H200 GPUs in a custom bf16 pipeline, running high-efficiency HSDP parallelism. It is also hosting the 2048 B300 GPU cluster used to train Trinity Large.The collaboration shows the difference between branding and execution. While Prime Intellect’s long-term goal remains decentralized compute, its short-term value for Arcee lies in efficient, transparent training infrastructure—infrastructure that remains under U.S. jurisdiction, with known provenance and security controls.A Strategic Bet on Model SovereigntyArcee&#x27;s push into full pretraining reflects a broader thesis: that the future of enterprise AI will depend on owning the training loop—not just fine-tuning. As systems evolve to adapt from live usage and interact with tools autonomously, compliance and control over training objectives will matter as much as performance.“As applications get more ambitious, the boundary between ‘model’ and ‘product’ keeps moving,” Atkins noted in Arcee&#x27;s Trinity manifesto. “To build that kind of software you need to control the weights and the training pipeline, not only the instruction layer.”This framing sets Trinity apart from other open-weight efforts. Rather than patching someone else’s base model, Arcee has built its own—from data to deployment, infrastructure to optimizer—alongside partners who share that vision of openness and sovereignty.Looking Ahead: Trinity LargeTraining is currently underway for Trinity Large, Arcee’s 420B parameter MoE model, using the same afmoe architecture scaled to a larger expert set. The dataset includes 20T tokens, split evenly between synthetic data from DatologyAI and curated wb data.The model is expected to launch next month in January 2026, with a full technical report to follow shortly thereafter.If successful, it would make Trinity Large one of the only fully open-weight, U.S.-trained frontier-scale models—positioning Arcee as a serious player in the open ecosystem at a time when most American LLM efforts are either closed or based on non-U.S. foundations.A recommitment to U.S. open sourceIn a landscape where the most ambitious open-weight models are increasingly shaped by Chinese research labs, Arcee’s Trinity launch signals a rare shift in direction: an attempt to reclaim ground for transparent, U.S.-controlled model development. Backed by specialized partners in data and infrastructure, and built from scratch for long-term adaptability, Trinity is a bold statement about the future of U.S. AI development, showing that small, lesser-known companies can still push the boundaries and innovate in an open fashion even as the industry is increasingly productized and commodtized. What remains to be seen is whether Trinity Large can match the capabilities of its better-funded peers. But with Mini and Nano already in use, and a strong architectural foundation in place, Arcee may already be proving its central thesis: that model sovereignty, not just model size, will define the next era of AI.",
          "content": "For much of 2025, the frontier of open-weight language models has been defined not in Silicon Valley or New York City, but in Beijing and Hangzhou.Chinese research labs including Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen, DeepSeek, Moonshot and Baidu have rapidly set the pace in developing large-scale, open Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models — often with permissive licenses and leading benchmark performance. While OpenAI fielded its own open source, general purpose LLM this summer as well — gpt-oss-20B and 120B — the uptake has been slowed by so many equally or better performing alternatives. Now, one small U.S. company is pushing back.Today, Arcee AI announced the release of Trinity Mini and Trinity Nano Preview, the first two models in its new “Trinity” family—an open-weight MoE model suite fully trained in the United States. Users can try the former directly for themselves in a chatbot format on Acree&#x27;s new website, chat.arcee.ai, and developers can download the code for both models on Hugging Face and run it themselves, as well as modify them/fine-tune to their liking — all for free under an enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license. While small compared to the largest frontier models, these releases represent a rare attempt by a U.S. startup to build end-to-end open-weight models at scale—trained from scratch, on American infrastructure, using a U.S.-curated dataset pipeline.\"I&#x27;m experiencing a combination of extreme pride in my team and crippling exhaustion, so I&#x27;m struggling to put into words just how excited I am to have these models out,\" wrote Arcee Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Lucas Atkins in a post on the social network X (formerly Twitter). \"Especially Mini.\"A third model, Trinity Large, is already in training: a 420B parameter model with 13B active parameters per token, scheduled to launch in January 2026.“We want to add something that has been missing in that picture,” Atkins wrote in the Trinity launch manifesto published on Arcee&#x27;s website. “A serious open weight model family trained end to end in America… that businesses and developers can actually own.”From Small Models to Scaled AmbitionThe Trinity project marks a turning point for Arcee AI, which until now has been known for its compact, enterprise-focused models. The company has raised $29.5 million in funding to date, including a $24 million Series A in 2024 led by Emergence Capital, and its previous releases include AFM-4.5B, a compact instruct-tuned model released in mid-2025, and SuperNova, an earlier 70B-parameter instruction-following model designed for in-VPC enterprise deployment. Both were aimed at solving regulatory and cost issues plaguing proprietary LLM adoption in the enterprise.With Trinity, Arcee is aiming higher: not just instruction tuning or post-training, but full-stack pretraining of open-weight foundation models—built for long-context reasoning, synthetic data adaptation, and future integration with live retraining systems.Originally conceived as a stepping stone to Trinity Large, both Mini and Nano emerged from early experimentation with sparse modeling and quickly became production targets themselves.Technical HighlightsTrinity Mini is a 26B parameter model with 3B active per token, designed for high-throughput reasoning, function calling, and tool use. Trinity Nano Preview is a 6B parameter model with roughly 800M active non-embedding parameters—a more experimental, chat-focused model with a stronger personality, but lower reasoning robustness. Both models use Arcee’s new Attention-First Mixture-of-Experts (AFMoE) architecture, a custom MoE design blending global sparsity, local/global attention, and gated attention techniques.Inspired by recent advances from DeepSeek and Qwen, AFMoE departs from traditional MoE by tightly integrating sparse expert routing with an enhanced attention stack — including grouped-query attention, gated attention, and a local/global pattern that improves long-context reasoning. Think of a typical MoE model like a call center with 128 specialized agents (called “experts”) — but only a few are consulted for each call, depending on the question. This saves time and energy, since not every expert needs to weigh in.What makes AFMoE different is how it decides which agents to call and how it blends their answers. Most MoE models use a standard approach that picks experts based on a simple ranking. AFMoE, by contrast, uses a smoother method (called sigmoid routing) that’s more like adjusting a volume dial than flipping a switch — letting the model blend multiple perspectives more gracefully.The “attention-first” part means the model focuses heavily on how it pays attention to different parts of the conversation. Imagine reading a novel and remembering some parts more clearly than others based on importance, recency, or emotional impact — that’s attention. AFMoE improves this by combining local attention (focusing on what was just said) with global attention (remembering key points from earlier), using a rhythm that keeps things balanced.Finally, AFMoE introduces something called gated attention, which acts like a volume control on each attention output — helping the model emphasize or dampen different pieces of information as needed, like adjusting how much you care about each voice in a group discussion.All of this is designed to make the model more stable during training and more efficient at scale — so it can understand longer conversations, reason more clearly, and run faster without needing massive computing resources.Unlike many existing MoE implementations, AFMoE emphasizes stability at depth and training efficiency, using techniques like sigmoid-based routing without auxiliary loss, and depth-scaled normalization to support scaling without divergence.Model CapabilitiesTrinity Mini adopts an MoE architecture with 128 experts, 8 active per token, and 1 always-on shared expert.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is done, but the sales still roll on, and Cyber Monday remains a decent chance to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Cyber Monday SSD deals and other storage discounts you can still get right now. It's not the most plentiful time for SSD deals more generally, but we're still seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards. We'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Cyber Monday microSD card deals Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off MSRP): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. There isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Also at B&H. Best Cyber Monday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T705 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $170 at B&H ($150 off, in and out of stock): If you need a bit more room from a PCIe 5.0 drive, the Crucial T705 is a slightly older but still highly rated alternative with blazing-fast speeds. This is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $750 at B&H ($270 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at B&H ($111 off, in and out of stock): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Best Cyber Monday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 Pro (4TB) portable SSD for $210 at B&H ($60 off): The X10 Pro is a older and slightly slower version of the X10 — confusing, we know — but it comes with a metal enclosure, a five-year warranty (instead of three) and 256-bit hardware encryption. The X9 Pro and standard X10 are better values when they’re cheaper, but that’s not the case right now if you want a 4TB drive. This deal matches an all-time low. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. This deal on the 2TB model is $15 higher than the all-time low we saw over the weekend, but it's still about $20 off the card's usual going rate in recent months. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model.

          "standfirst": "HBO Max has a limited-time, one-year subscription deal, offering a chance to stream HBO originals and Warner Bros. blockbusters at a lower cost. The platform has reduced pricing to $3 per month for one year, bringing the final cost down to $36 for the year. With many streaming services increasing their rates, this short-term offer lets you catch up on hit shows and new releases without committing to a full year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. The deal runs through the end of the day December 1. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads.

The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less.

The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Apple TV+ continues to have one of the strongest and most varied lineups in streaming. Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience. All content is ad-free and available in up to 4K HDR, with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support where available. The app works on nearly every device, from iPhone and iPad to smart TVs, PlayStation, Xbox and Roku. You can also download episodes and movies to watch offline, which is handy for travel or long commutes. If you’re already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the integration is seamless. You can share your subscription with up to five other people through Family Sharing, and playback syncs across devices so you can start a show on your iPhone and finish it on your TV. Apple TV+ is also part of the Apple One bundle if you prefer to manage multiple Apple services under a single plan. This deal is available to new and qualified returning subscribers, meaning those who haven’t had an active subscription in the past 30 days. You’ll need to sign up directly through Apple rather than a third-party service or carrier. Once the three-month period ends, the plan renews at the standard $13 per month, so be sure to cancel before the renewal date if you don’t want to continue. With a growing slate of original series, award-winning films and a slick interface, Apple TV+ has turned into one of the best streaming services for premium content.

          "standfirst": "Samsung has unveiled its newest smartphone, and it's the highly-anticipated Galaxy Z TriFold. During an interview in July, a Samsung exec confirmed that the company was working on a three-panel phone that it aimed to release by the end of the year. The company said it expects the phone to be available for purchase in Korea on December 12, with markets including China, Taiwan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. For US shoppers, the TriFold will be available in the first quarter of 2026, but no specific date has been revealed yet.The phone has an inward-folding design intended to protect the main display. If it has been folded incorrectly, the device will automatically vibrate and show an on-screen alert to notify its user. When fully extended, the TriFold has a 10-inch screen and the cover screen is 6.5 inches when folded up. It is 3.9mm at its thinnest point when unfolded and then 12.9mm while collapsed. To give that some context, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a traditional foldable that also has a 6.5-inch exterior screen and an internal display that opens to 8 inches wide diagonally. It has a profile of 8.9mm when folded and weighs 215 grams compared with the TriFold's 309 grams. With its two-hinge form, the TriFold makes it so you have basically a ten-inch tablet that folds down to a slightly heftier version of the Z Fold 7.A side view of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold showing its thickness in the unfolded stateSamsungFoldables introduce some additional design demands, and Samsung said that the screen panels meet with minimal gap but no actual contact when they are closed. The hinges have been designed to resist wear and the screen received a new reinforced overcoat to improve resistance. The phone runs on a custom Snapdragon 8 chip. It has a 5,600mAh three-cell battery system and offers 45W super-fast charging. The rear camera lineup includes a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 200MP wide-angle lens and a 10MP telephoto lens, which is identical to the setup on the Z Fold 7. The main screen and the cover screen both have 10MP front cameras. No pricing information is currently available, but it seems like a safe assumption that this will be expensive. The Z Fold 7 starts at $2,000, so expect to pay a premium for that second hinge.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is almost over — so if you didn't get a chance to get everything on your list during Black Friday (or were too tired from Thanksgiving to shop) now is likely your last chance to snag the better deals. If Anker gear is on your list, there’s good news: every deal we found last week is still going strong. We think Anker makes some of the most reliable charging gear out there, which is why it keeps winning out in our tests and ending up in our guides to MagSafe power banks, wireless charging stations, iPhone accessories and more. So forget all that stuff about early birds, there are plenty of worms for the later birds, too. Just don't wait too long, our guess is that many of these deals will expire Monday night. Here are the best Cyber Monday Anker deals we could find. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker's Laptop Power Bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features is going for nearly $50 of right now. If could recommend one purchase to Engadget readers, this would be it. We think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. It's got a higher capacity and wattage rating and it looks just as sleek. Plus, in my humble opinion, $38 is a way better deal than $99. Anker also makes our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2). Thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity, it's one of the best ways to recharge an iPhone on the go.. I love this shiny little brick. The 3-in-1 portable charger has a built-in cable that's also a strap, plus wall prongs and a handy display. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Cyber Monday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Cyber Monday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Cyber Monday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Cyber Monday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands aside from just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Cyber Monday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Cyber Monday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

Thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity, it's one of the best ways to recharge an iPhone on the go.. I love this shiny little brick. The 3-in-1 portable charger has a built-in cable that's also a strap, plus wall prongs and a handy display. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Cyber Monday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Cyber Monday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Cyber Monday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Cyber Monday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands aside from just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Cyber Monday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Cyber Monday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

          "standfirst": "Apple has tapped AI researcher Amar Subramanya, a longtime Google exec who was most recently corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, as its new VP of AI. The company also announced that current AI exec, John Giannandrea, will retire in 2026.Subramanya, who Apple describes as a \"renowned AI researcher,\" spent 16 years at Google, where he was head of engineering for Gemini. He left Google earlier this year for Microsoft. In a press release, Apple said that Subramanya will report to Craig Federighi and will \"be leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation.\" It's not entirely surprising that Apple is shaking up its AI leadership. Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 after a stint at Google that included VP of search. While his hiring was seen as a major coup for Apple at the time, the company has faced some significant setbacks since. Most notably, its failure to deliver a more personalized, AI-centric version of Siri that it previewed last year. Giannandrea, who oversaw Siri for years, has shouldered much of the blame for the delays. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Apple CEO Tim Cook had \"lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development\" and put other executives in charge of Siri instead. In a statement, Cook said he was \"thankful\" for Giannandrea's contributions to the company and credited Federighi with pushing the revamped Siri forward. \"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-hires-google-veteran-as-its-new-vice-president-of-ai-234820021.html?src=rss",

If you've been waiting for a serious sale to pick up a mic of your own, Cyber Monday may be your chance. The DJI Mic Mini kit is on sale for more than half off: you can snag it for a mere $80. That's an all-time low price compared to the set's usual $170 price tag. The full package includes two mics, a receiver and a charging case, as well as two windscreens and other accessories. Depending on what peripherals you need along with your wireless microphone, DJI has several other promising Cyber Monday deals. If you don't want the charging case, you can get the Mic Mini without for just $66, which is a of 45 percent discount. Another option is a bundle featuring a single mic, receiver, charging dock and accessories for $45, or 49 percent off the regular price. DJI's Mic Mini microphones (transmitters) weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit, 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 Pro and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. With a range of 1300 feet and 48 hours of battery life with the charger case, they're an excellent addition to a creator's bag of tricks. Again, note that you can grab one a big cheaper without the charging case. DJI's Mic Mini deal includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with the charging case, two windscreens, a splitter USB-C cable for charging, a 3.5mm camera audio cable, two magnetic clips, a smartphone adapter, a charging cable and a compact carrying case. At this price the deal may not last the week, so if you've been eyeing one, act quickly.

Sonos' Era line has previously included one of our top smart speaker picks, and the Era 300 is the only standalone speaker from the company that offers spatial audio. The spatial audio angle is the highlight feature for the Era 300, which can stream compatible tracks from either Apple Music or Amazon Music. While the spatial audio features proved to be hit and miss in our review, this is still an outstanding speaker with excellent audio quality. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers. The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don't need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That's especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only. If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Cyber Monday. You can get the smaller — but still mighty — Era 100 for $169 (23 percent off). The portable Move 2 is down to $399 (20 percent off). Even the company's headphones, Sonos Ace, are on sale for $279 (30 percent off). Sonos home theater products are discounted, too. You can get the Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off), or the Sub 4 subwoofer for $719 (also 20 percent off). Or, if you're in the market for both and have the budget, save even more on a bundle: Get the Arc Ultra and Sub 4 for $1,499 (25 percent off).

This post is organized around several scenarios, which I'll list in bold. You want to send an announcement just as an FYI to Techmeme: In the typical scenario, in which you think Techmeme is unlikely to feature the news, or you're not familiar with our criteria for posting, it's best not to do anything. Techmeme only posts about 50 headlines per day and any given announcement is very unlikely to be featured. So save us both time and focus on more fruitful channels than Techmeme. You want to send news to Techmeme that you think there's a good chance we'll want to post: If you're familiar with Techmeme and anticipate we'll be interested in the story, you can tip the link using this online form. This form integrates into editors' workflow so human editors will see the link in real time. As a bonus, the form requests an email address, enabling us to notify you if we do post the link. For the (hopefully rare) bad actor out there, I need to stress that all submissions are fully vetted by human editors, so any spamming attempt will silently fail. You want to add a social link underneath news that is already featured on Techmeme: We often feature related blog posts and social posts from LinkedIn, X, Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon beneath our headlines, and you are encouraged to contribute these links. Just hover over the headline on our desktop page and click the \"Add Link Here\" button that appears. (For an example, see the image below.) As long as the link you submit adds value in some way, we will add it, and you'll get an email confirming this once we do. Feel free to tip your own links or links from your company, clients, or friends. As long as the link makes Techmeme better, it's a win/win for you and us. (Once again, I must stress that for the rare bad actor, all submissions are fully vetted, and spammy links will not make it to Techmeme.) You are briefing publications on embargoed news and want to let Techmeme know: Larger companies often give us a heads-up on major announcements, because it helps us post as soon as possible after the embargo and arrange more comprehensive coverage. Because embargoed news isn't public yet, there's no link for it, so you can't submit via our online form. So instead, you can submit details via this special email address. To ease the process for both companies and Techmeme, our policy is to automatically accept embargoed information sent to this email address, meaning we won't publish any information sent to us until it's public. So please don't start off by asking if we accept. Yes, we accept, and have handled embargoes from the biggest tech companies for over a decade without incident. When you email, please include as much detail as you can, including the embargo time, any blog posts or press releases, and specifics on the publications you've briefed. Note that this email address will reach a person who then routes the news to a limited set of editors. (It is not an alias that simply forwards to all editors.) Because of this we request you email 12 or more hours before the embargo time if possible. Techmeme posted something erroneous or misleading and you want to let us know: Occasionally we flub a headline, or mention a detail from a story that was later corrected unbeknownst to us. In scenarios like this, we definitely want to know so we can fix our headline, or, less commonly, remove or replace our headline, so please use this email address to reach us. Note that you can also use this email address for sending other information or even news tips that can't easily be conveyed by a single URL (making it hard to use this form.) Please note that while we always read these emails, in many cases, we don't have time to reply. As a bonus, here are a few non-editorial scenarios for contacting us: to place ads on Techmeme, email us here, to inquire about our media monitoring and summary services, email us here, and for matters unrelated to all of the above, use this email address.

On Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” at the company to improve ChatGPT, delaying advertising plans and other products in the process, The Information reported based on a leaked internal memo. The move follows Google’s release of its Gemini 3 model last month, which has outperformed ChatGPT on some industry benchmark tests and sparked high-profile praise on social media. In the memo, Altman wrote, “We are at a critical time for ChatGPT.” The company will push back work on advertising integration, AI agents for health and shopping, and a personal assistant feature called Pulse. Altman encouraged temporary team transfers and established daily calls for employees responsible for enhancing the chatbot. The directive creates an odd symmetry with events from December 2022, when Google management declared its own “code red” internal emergency after ChatGPT launched and rapidly gained in popularity. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai reassigned teams across the company to develop AI prototypes and products to compete with OpenAI’s chatbot. Now, three years later, the AI industry is in a very different place.Read full article Comments",

Pazdur, an oncologist who has worked at the FDA since 1999, was seen as a stabilizing force for an agency that has been mired in turmoil during the second Trump administration. He took over the role of leading the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on November 11, after the previous leader, George Tidmarsh, left the agency amid an investigation and a lawsuit regarding allegations that he used his position to exact petty revenge on a former business partner. In light of the scandal, one venture capital investor called the agency a “clown show.” Drug industry groups, meanwhile, called the FDA erratic and unpredictable. Pazdur’s selection was seen as a positive sign by agency insiders, drug industry representatives, and patient advocacy groups, according to reporting by The Washington Post.Read full article Comments",

Liftoff could happen around 11 pm EST tonight (04:00 UTC Wednesday), or noon local time at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China. Airspace warning notices advising pilots to steer clear of the rocket’s flight path suggest LandSpace has a launch window of about two hours. When it lifts off, the Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket will become the largest commercial launch vehicle ever flown in China. What’s more, LandSpace will become the first Chinese launch provider to attempt a landing of its first stage booster, using the same tried-and-true return method pioneered by SpaceX and, more recently, Blue Origin in the United States.Read full article Comments",

Reuters reported today, citing three anonymous sources, that “Apple does not plan to comply with a mandate to preload its smartphones with a state-owned cyber safety app and will convey its concerns to New Delhi.” Reuters noted that the government mandate has “sparked surveillance concerns and a political uproar.” The government’s Sanchar Saathi (“Communication Partner”) app is billed as a consumer tool for reporting suspected fraud communications, verifying the genuineness of a phone, and blocking lost or stolen handsets. The app can already be installed by users as it is available on the Apple and Google Play app stores, but the government wants device makers such as Apple, Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi to load phones with the app before they are shipped.Read full article Comments",

The specs promise decent 1080p-to-1440p performance in most games, with 4K occasionally reachable with assistance from FSR upscaling—about what you’d expect from a box with a modern midrange graphics card in it. But there’s one spec that has caused some concern among Ars staffers and others with their eyes on the Steam Machine: The GPU comes with just 8GB of dedicated graphics RAM, an amount that is steadily becoming more of a bottleneck for midrange GPUs like AMD’s Radeon RX 7060 and 9060, or Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 or 5060. In our reviews of these GPUs, we’ve already run into some games where the RAM ceiling limits performance in Windows, especially at 1440p. But we’ve been doing more extensive testing of various GPUs with SteamOS, and we can confirm that in current betas, 8GB GPUs struggle even more on SteamOS than they do running the same games at the same settings in Windows 11.Read full article Comments",

The new version is rolling out first on Google’s Pixel phones, featuring more icon customization, easier parental controls, and AI-powered notifications. Don’t be bummed if you aren’t first in line for the new Android 16—Google also has a raft of general improvements coming to the wider Android ecosystem. Android 16, part 2 Since rolling out the first version of Android in 2008, Google has largely stuck to one major release per year. Android 16 changes things, moving from one monolithic release to two. Today’s OS update is the second part of the Android 16 era, but don’t expect major changes. As expected, the first release in June made more changes. Most of what we’ll see in the second update is geared toward Google’s Pixel phones, plus some less notable changes for developers. Google’s new AI features for notifications are probably the most important change. Android 16 will use AI for two notification tasks: summarizing and organizing. The OS will take long chat conversations and summarize the notifications with AI. Notification data is processed locally on the device and won’t be uploaded anywhere. In the notification shade, the collapsed notification line will feature a summary of the conversation rather than a snippet of one message. Expanding the notification will display the full text.Read full article Comments",

The lavish new smartphone is launching this month in South Korea with a hefty price tag, and it will eventually make its way to the US in early 2026. Samsung says it refined its Armor FlexHinge design for the TriFold. The device’s two hinges are slightly different sizes because the phone’s three panels have distinct shapes. The center panel is the thickest at 4.2 mm, and the other two are fractions of a millimeter thinner. The phone has apparently been designed to account for the varying sizes and weights, allowing the frame to fold up tight in a pocketable form factor. Huawei’s impressive Mate XT tri-fold phones have been making the rounds online, but they’re not available in Western markets. Samsung’s new foldable looks similar at a glance, but the way the three panels fit together is different. The Mate XT folds in a Z-shaped configuration, using part of the main screen as the cover display. On Samsung’s phone, the left and right segments fold inward behind the separate cover screen. Samsung claims it has tested the design extensively to verify that the hinges will hold up to daily use for years.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Credit: ArcGIS Easter Island is famous for its giant monumental statues, called moai, built some 800 years ago. The volcanic rock used for the moai came from a quarry site called Rano Raraku. Archaeologists have created a high-resolution interactive 3D model of the quarry site to learn more about the processes used to create the moai. (You can explore the full interactive model here.) According to a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE, the model shows that there were numerous independent groups, probably family clans, that created the moai, rather than a centralized management system. “You can see things that you couldn’t actually see on the ground. You can see tops and sides and all kinds of areas that just would never be able to walk to,” said co-author Carl Lipo of Binghamton University. “We can say, ‘Here, go look at it.’ If you want to see the different kinds of carving, fly around and see stuff there. We’re documenting something that really has needed to be documented, but in a way that’s really comprehensive and shareable.” Lipo is one of the foremost experts on the Easter Island moai. In October, we reported on Lipo’s experimental confirmation—based on 3D modeling of the physics and new field tests to re-create that motion—that Easter Island’s people transported the statues in a vertical position, with workers using ropes to essentially “walk” the moai onto their platforms. To explain the presence of so many moai, the assumption has been that the island was once home to tens of thousands of people. Read full article Comments",

The findings reveal a weakness in how these models process instructions that may shed light on why some prompt injection or jailbreaking approaches work, though the researchers caution their analysis of some production models remains speculative since training data details of prominent commercial AI models are not publicly available. The team, led by Chantal Shaib and Vinith M. Suriyakumar, tested this by asking models questions with preserved grammatical patterns but nonsensical words. For example, when prompted with “Quickly sit Paris clouded?” (mimicking the structure of “Where is Paris located?”), models still answered “France.” This suggests models absorb both meaning and syntactic patterns, but can overrely on structural shortcuts when they strongly correlate with specific domains in training data, which sometimes allows patterns to override semantic understanding in edge cases. The team plans to present these findings at NeurIPS later this month.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fired from an underground silo on the country’s southern steppe Friday on a scheduled test to deliver a dummy warhead to a remote impact zone nearly 4,000 miles away. The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.Read full article Comments",

It’s undisputed that OpenAI deleted the datasets, known as “Books 1” and “Books 2,” prior to ChatGPT’s release in 2022. Created by former OpenAI employees in 2021, the datasets were built by scraping the open web and seizing the bulk of its data from a shadow library called Library Genesis (LibGen).Read full article Comments",

          "content": "By the time the second group of NASA astronauts reach the Moon later this decade, the space agency would like to have a lunar rover waiting for them. But as the space agency nears a key selection, some government officials are seeking an insurance policy of sorts to increase the program’s chance of success. At issue is the agency’s “Lunar Terrain Vehicle” (LTV) contract. In April 2024, the space agency awarded a few tens of millions of dollars to three companies—Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Astrolab—to complete preliminary design work on vehicle concepts. NASA then planned to down-select to one company to construct one or more rovers, land on the Moon, and provide rover services for a decade beginning in 2029. Over the lifetime of the fixed-price services contract, there was a combined maximum potential value of $4.6 billion. The companies have since completed their design work, including the construction of prototypes, and submitted their final bids for the much larger services contract in August. According to two sources, NASA has since been weighing those bids and is prepared to announce a final selection before the end of this month.Read full article Comments",

Some justices were skeptical of arguments that ISPs should have no legal obligation under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to terminate an account when a user’s IP address has been repeatedly flagged for downloading pirated music. But justices also seemed hesitant to rule in favor of record labels, with some of the debate focusing on how ISPs should handle large accounts like universities where there could be tens of thousands of users.

He had heard from a friend that Chinese companies were recruiting at new rare-earth mining sites in territory administered by the United Wa State Army, Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed group, and that workers could earn upwards of $1,400 a month. It was an opportunity too good to pass up in a country where the formal economy has collapsed since the 2021 military coup, and nearly half of the population lives on less than $2 a day. So Sian set off by car for the town of Mong Pawk, then rode a motorbike for hours through the thick forest. Hired for daily wages of approximately $21, he now digs boreholes and installs pipes. It is the first step in a process called in situ leaching, which involves injecting acidic solutions into mountainsides, then collecting the drained solution in plastic-lined pools where solids, like dysprosium and terbium, two of the world’s most sought-after heavy rare-earth metals, settle out. The resulting sediment sludge is then transported to furnaces and burned, producing dry rare earth oxides.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It’s been over 10 years since the launch of the excellent The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and nearly four years since the announcement of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete Witcher games in a short six-year window. In a recent earnings call, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine in 2022. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of widespread technical issues with the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077, which CDPR later blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.” “We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [The Witcher 4] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”Read full article Comments",
