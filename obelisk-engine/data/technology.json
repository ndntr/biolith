          "standfirst": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s OK to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales already floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. The current selection includes several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense, but we’ll update this post through Black Friday itself as more deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that has received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s especially adept at fending off glare in a bright room. It also has a 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,398 at Amazon ($602 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the more expensive Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV for as little as possible, it'll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-tcl-and-more-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143676.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The Google Search of AI agents? Fetch launches ASI:One and Business tier for new era of non-human web",
          "standfirst": "Fetch AI, a startup founded and led by former DeepMind founding investor, Humayun Sheikh, today announced the release of three interconnected products designed to provide the trust, coordination, and interoperability needed for large-scale AI agent ecosystems. The launch includes ASI:One, a personal-AI orchestration platform; Fetch Business, a verification and discovery portal for brand agents; and Agentverse, an open directory hosting more than two million agents. Together, the system positions Fetch as an infrastructure provider for what it calls the “Agentic Web”—a layer where consumer AIs and brand AIs collaborate to complete tasks instead of merely suggesting them.The company says the tools address a central limitation in current consumer AI: models can provide recommendations but cannot reliably execute multi-step actions that require coordination across businesses. Fetch’s approach centers on enabling agents from different organizations to interoperate securely, using verified identities and shared context to complete end-to-end workflows.“We’re creating the same foundation for agents that Google created for websites,” said Humayun Sheikh, Founder and CEO of Fetch AI, and an early investor in DeepMind, in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “Instead of just finding information, your personal AI coordinates with verified brand agents to get things done.”Background: Fetch’s Founding and DeepMind Connection Fetch AI was founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh, an entrepreneur whose early investment in DeepMind helped support the company’s commercial development before its acquisition by Google. “I was one of the first five people at DeepMind and its first investor. My check was the first one in,” Sheikh said, reflecting on the period when advanced machine learning research was still largely inaccessible outside major technology companies.His early experience helped shape Fetch’s direction. “Even in 2013, it was clear to me that agentic systems were going to be the ones that worked. That’s where I focused—on the agentic web,” Sheikh noted. Fetch built on this thesis by developing infrastructure for autonomous software agents, focusing on verifiable identity, secure data exchange, and multi-agent coordination. Over the past several years, the company has expanded to a 70-person team across Cambridge and Menlo Park, raised approximately $60 million, and accumulated more than one million users interacting with its model—data that informed the design of the newly launched products.Sheikh added that his decision to bootstrap the company initially came directly from the proceeds of the DeepMind exit, noting in the interview that while the sale to Google was “a good exit,” he believed the team could have held out for a higher valuation. The early self-funding period allowed Fetch to begin work in 2015—well before transformer architectures went mainstream—on the hypothesis that agentic infrastructure would become foundational to applied AI.ASI:One — A Platform for Multi-Agent OrchestrationAt the core of the launch is ASI:One, a language model interface designed specifically for coordinating multiple agents rather than addressing isolated queries. Fetch describes it as an “intelligence layer” that handles context sharing, task routing, and preference modeling.The system stores user-level signals such as favored airlines, dietary constraints, budget ranges, loyalty program identifiers, and calendar availability. When a user requests a complex task—such as planning a trip with flights, hotels, and restaurant reservations—ASI:One retrieves those preferences and delegates work to the appropriate verified agents. The agents then return actionable outputs, including inventory and booking options, rather than generic recommendations.In practice, ASI:One functions as a workflow generator across organizational boundaries. By contrast with conventional LLM applications, which often rely on APIs or RAG techniques to surface information, ASI:One is built to coordinate autonomous agents that can complete transactions. Fetch notes that personalization improves over time as the model accumulates structured preference data.Sheikh emphasized the distinction between orchestrated execution and traditional AI output. “This isn’t searching for options separately and hoping they work together,” he said. “It’s orchestration.” He added that Fetch’s architecture is intentionally modular: “Our architecture is a mix of agentic and expert models. One large model isn’t enough—you need specialists. That’s why we built ASI1, tuned specifically for agentic systems.”The interview also revealed new details about ASI:One’s personalization systems: the platform uses multiple user-owned knowledge graphs to store preferences, travel history, social connections, and contextual constraints. These knowledge graphs are siloed per user and not co-mingled with any Fetch-operated data. Sheikh described this as a “deterministic backbone” that gives the personal AI a stable memory layer beyond the probabilistic output of a single large model.ASI:One launches in Beta today, with a broader release planned for early 2026. Fetch also offers ASI:One Mobile, released earlier this year, giving users access to the same agent-orchestration capabilities on iOS and Android. The mobile app connects directly to Agentverse and the user’s knowledge graphs, enabling on-the-go task execution and real-time interaction with registered agents.Fetch Business — Verified Identity and Brand ControlTo enable reliable coordination between consumers and companies, Fetch is introducing a verification and discovery portal called Fetch Business. The platform allows organizations to verify their identity and claim an official Brand Agent handle—for example, @Hilton or @Nike—regardless of which tools they use to build the underlying agent.Fetch positions the product as an analogue to ICANN domain registration and SSL certificate systems for websites. Verified status is intended to protect consumers from interacting with counterfeit or untrusted agents, a problem the company describes as a major barrier to widespread agent adoption.The system includes low-code tools for small businesses to create agents in a few steps and connect real-time APIs such as inventory, booking systems, or CRM platforms. “With Fetch, you can create an agent in one minute. It gets a handle, like a Twitter username, and you can personalize it completely—even give it your social media permissions to post on your behalf,” Sheikh said. Once a brand claims its namespace, its agent becomes discoverable to consumer AIs and other agents inside Agentverse.The company has pre-reserved thousands of brand namespaces in anticipation of demand. Verification status persists across any platform that integrates with Agentverse, creating a portable identity layer for business agents.The interview highlighted that Fetch Business inherits web-trust primitives directly: domain owners verify their identity by inserting a short code snippet into their existing website backend, allowing the system to pass a cryptographic challenge and grant the agent an authenticity badge similar to a “blue check” for agent identities. Sheikh framed this as “reusing the trust layer the web already spent decades building.”Companies can begin claiming agents now at business.fetch.ai.Agentverse — An Open Directory of More Than Two Million AgentsThe final component of the release is Agentverse, an open directory and cloud platform that hosts agents and enables cross-ecosystem discoverability. Fetch states that millions of agents have already registered, spanning travel, retail, entertainment, food service, and enterprise categories.Agentverse provides metadata, capability descriptions, and routing logic that ASI:One uses to identify appropriate agents for specific tasks. It also supports secure communication and data exchange between agents. The company notes that the directory is platform-agnostic: agents built with any framework can join and interoperate.According to Sheikh, the lack of a discovery layer is one reason most AI agents see little or no usage. “Ninety percent of AI agents never get used because there’s no discovery layer,” he said. He framed the role of Agentverse in more technical terms: “Right now, if you build an agent, there’s no universal way for others to discover it. That’s what AgentVerse solves—it’s like DNS for agents.” He also described the system as an essential component of the emerging agent economy: “Fetch is building the Google of agents. Just like websites needed search, agents need discovery, trust, and interaction—Fetch provides all of that.”The interview further underscored that Agentverse is cloud-agnostic by design. Sheikh contrasted this with competing agent ecosystems tied to specific cloud providers, arguing that a universal registry is only viable if independent of proprietary cloud environments. He said the open architecture enables an LLM to query any agent “within one minute of deployment,” turning agent publication into a near-instantaneous process similar to registering a domain.Agentverse also integrates payment pathways, enabling agents to execute purchases using partners such as Visa, Skyfire, and supported stablecoins. Consumers can configure spending limits or require explicit approval for transactions.Industry Context and ImplicationsFetch’s launch comes at a time when consumer AI platforms are exploring the shift from static chat interfaces toward autonomous agents capable of completing actions. However, most agent systems remain limited by siloed architectures, limited interoperability, and weak verification standards.Fetch positions its infrastructure as a response to these limitations by providing a cross-platform coordination layer, identity system, and directory service. The company argues that an agent ecosystem requires consistent verification mechanisms to ensure that consumers interact with authentic brand representatives rather than imitations. By establishing namespace control and portable trust indicators, Fetch Business aims to fill a gap similar to early web domain verification.At the same time, ASI:One attempts to centralize user preference data in a way that enables more efficient personalization and multi-agent coordination. This approach differs from generalist LLM applications, which often lack persistent preference architectures or direct access to brand-controlled agents.The interview also made clear that micropayments and digital transaction infrastructure are central to Fetch’s long-term vision. Sheikh referenced integrations with protocols such as Coinbase’s 402 and AP2, positioning these capabilities as essential for autonomous agents to complete end-to-end tasks that include financial execution.TakeawayFetch’s combined release of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse introduces an interconnected stack designed to support large-scale deployment and usage of AI agents. The company frames the system as foundational infrastructure for an agentic ecosystem, where consumer AIs can coordinate with verified brand agents to complete tasks reliably and securely. The additions to its identity, discovery, and orchestration layers reflect Fetch’s long-standing thesis—rooted partly in lessons from DeepMind’s early development—that intelligence becomes meaningful only when paired with the capacity to act.",

By establishing namespace control and portable trust indicators, Fetch Business aims to fill a gap similar to early web domain verification.At the same time, ASI:One attempts to centralize user preference data in a way that enables more efficient personalization and multi-agent coordination. This approach differs from generalist LLM applications, which often lack persistent preference architectures or direct access to brand-controlled agents.The interview also made clear that micropayments and digital transaction infrastructure are central to Fetch’s long-term vision. Sheikh referenced integrations with protocols such as Coinbase’s 402 and AP2, positioning these capabilities as essential for autonomous agents to complete end-to-end tasks that include financial execution.TakeawayFetch’s combined release of ASI:One, Fetch Business, and Agentverse introduces an interconnected stack designed to support large-scale deployment and usage of AI agents. The company frames the system as foundational infrastructure for an agentic ecosystem, where consumer AIs can coordinate with verified brand agents to complete tasks reliably and securely. The additions to its identity, discovery, and orchestration layers reflect Fetch’s long-standing thesis—rooted partly in lessons from DeepMind’s early development—that intelligence becomes meaningful only when paired with the capacity to act.",

          "title": "The best Black Friday deals on SSDs and other storage devices we can find",
          "standfirst": "As with most tech products, Black Friday sales are usually a good time to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could already find. So far we’re seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards, but we expect many more deals to pop up over the next few days, so we'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Black Friday microSD card deals PNY microSD Express Card (256GB) for $50 at Amazon ($10 off): The only reason to buy a superfast microSD Express card right now is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that deal quickly sells out, this is the lowest price we’ve tracked for PNY’s equivalent model. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Likewise, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard first. This offer isn’t technically a Black Friday deal, as it expires on Thursday, but it ties the lowest price we’ve seen for the 1TB model. Use the code BNE4643 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Amazon ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally faster, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop we’ve seen for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-and-other-storage-devices-we-can-find-175429637.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Sling TV has won the first stage of a legal battle with Disney over the short-term passes that the streaming service introduced in August. The Dish Network-owned platform started offering daily ($5), weekend ($10) and weekly ($15) passes for its Sling Orange plan, which costs $46 on a monthly basis. Disney owns several channels that are offered through Sling TV platforms, including multiple ESPN channels and the Disney Channel. It did not take too kindly to the new offerings — Disney promptly filed a lawsuit over the short-term live TV passes, as well as an emergency request to halt them. As reported by Cord Cutters, US District Judge Arun Subramanian dismissed the latter motion after determining Disney failed to demonstrate \"it would suffer irreparable harm\" without the court's immediate intervention.“Disney hasn’t shown it has lost customers due to the passes,” Judge Subramanian wrote in an 11-page ruling, per The Verge. “The networks are being distributed in the same platform, in the same manner, that they always have, but to a broader array of Sling customers.”A viewer might not want to sign up to a streaming service for an entire month if they only want to watch a single game (say, a winner-take-all soccer match in which a team scores three utterly sensational goals to take their country to the men’s World Cup for the first time in 28 years). However, Disney asserted that, under its agreement with Sling TV, the platform can only offer access to its channels to traditional subscribers. Under Disney's interpretation, those are consumers who have recurring monthly subscriptions.Judge Subramanian disagreed, pointing out that the contract defines a subscriber as “a person intentionally authorized by Dish to receive any level of video programming service or package of programming networks via the Sling Platform.” The judge added that, as far as a \"subscriber\" goes, \"there’s no minimum subscription length or other terms specified\" and the term refers to anyone who is entitled to receive “any level of video programming service or package of programming networks.” Judge Subramanian argued that this \"broad definition clearly covers users of the passes at issue in this case.\" Disney also claimed that the short-term passes would pull consumers away from its own standalone ESPN streaming service. The company offered up evidence to that end, but Judge Subramanian wrote that the documentation \"doesn’t show that the passes siphon customers from ESPN Unlimited.” The judge added that, \"if the passes do siphon customers from ESPN Unlimited, Disney hasn’t shown that those losses would not be quantifiable.\"While the short-term passes remain in place for now (with Sling TV offering $1 per day passes until November 30 to celebrate this initial victory), the breach-of-contract lawsuit Disney has filed will move forward. Judge Subramanian also pointed out that the current agreement between the two sides runs out within the next 12 months and they're set to start renegotiating terms soon. So, if Disney wants to prohibit the short-term passes or have its networks excluded from them, it can try to hash that out in contract talks.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-fails-in-initial-bid-to-halt-sling-tvs-short-term-streaming-passes-175000436.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "European policymakers have proposed sweeping changes to the way the EU regulates the tech industry. In just the last few months, the likes of Meta and Google have questioned strict EU policies relating to privacy and AI expansion, but if the European Commission’s new package of proposals are passed, a number of big tech roadblocks will be removed. Or at least lifted up a bit. Changes to rules around AI, cybersecurity and data will, according to policymakers, generate growth for European businesses, while \"promoting Europe’s highest standards of fundamental rights, data protection, safety and fairness.\" Among the proposals are amendments to the AI Act that Google has recently expressed concerns about, which would allow AI companies to access shared personal data for training models. It also wants to simplify paperwork for smaller companies, and to make AI literacy a requirement for member states. AI oversight would also be centralized into the AI Office where general-purpose AI models are being used, a move intended to \"reduce governance fragmentation.\" In addition, strict rules around the use of AI in areas deemed to be high-risk, which were expected to come in next summer, could be delayed until the Commission confirms that \"the needed standards and support tools\" are available to affected companies. The infamous (and admittedly very annoying) cookie banners that are foundational to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will also be rethought under the Commission’s proposals. If approved, people would see these banners pop up with less regularity, give their consent with one click, and save their cookie preferences so they presumably could be automatically applied within a browser. The European Commission’s \"digital omnibus\" now goes to the European Parliament for approval, where it could face serious opposition. While the proposals are likely to be welcomed by the rapidly-growing AI industry, sceptics could argue that watered down privacy and AI legislation is evidence of Europe bowing to pressure from big tech and Donald Trump, who has publicly criticized the EU’s digital regulation. This would represent a marked turnaround from the EU’s long-standing reputation as the tech industry’s most stubborn adversary. Back in September, it rejected calls from Apple to repeal its Digital Markets Act (DMA), a legal framework that Apple has repeatedly been accused of violating by the EU.

          "standfirst": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark. Wall chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented. All are pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk). Rest assured, these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh. For just $13. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $20 ($7 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off our outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $24 ($11 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $26 ($7 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and others is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity among smart plugs. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $35 ($15 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $36 ($55 off) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $40 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $45 ($11 off with Prime) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $50 ($20 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-under-50-are-already-live-anker-chargers-apple-airtags-blink-cameras-legos-and-more-173833576.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Sure, Black Friday is a fine time to save on big ticket items, like laptops and TVs, but it’s also a wise opportunity to snag smaller devices and accessories at a discount. Here, we’ve gathered together our favorite and recommended electronics that fall under the $50 mark. Wall chargers, speakers, smart plugs, portable batteries and streaming sticks are represented. All are pulled from our dozens of buying guides which we update several times per year to include our latest testing (ask me how many power banks I have on my desk). Rest assured, these picks are worthwhile. Here are the best Black Friday tech deals under $50. Best Black Friday deals under $25 Audible, 3 months and a $20 credit for $3 ($42 off) at Amazon: As it does each Black Friday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. The plan auto-renews at a dollar per month for three months, then defaults to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh. For just $13. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Walmart: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $20 ($7 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off our outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $20 ($10 off): If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last Black Friday it dropped as low as $18. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $24 ($11 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Black Friday. This cute as a button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off) at Amazon: Quit losing your keys (or jacket or backpack) by attaching this colorful tracker to it. The Pop is our overall favorite in Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers as it’s loud, feature-rich and taps into Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Best Black Friday deals under $50 Meross WiFi Dual Smart Plug (2-pack) for $26 ($7 off) at Amazon: The difference between this one and others is the dual outlet — a surprising rarity among smart plugs. Meross’s dual plug works with home systems from Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung and lets you control each of the two outlets independently. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last Black Friday. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy.

That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $36 ($55 off) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best.

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles starting November 21. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart when they launch on Friday. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. Also starting November 21, the DualSense Wireless Controller will be down to $60, a $20 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $170 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $180.

          "standfirst": "Good deals on Apple products are generally harder to come by throughout the year than with other brands, but sale events are usually the best time to look around. And sure enough, ahead of Black Friday, Apple’s AirTags are cheaper than ever. You can pick up a four-pack of these handy Bluetooth trackers for $65, a record low price. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

          "standfirst": "We're expecting some pretty good deals on Anker gear for Black Friday, and decided to round up what we found so far right here. Anker deserves a little extra attention, after all. The brand makes some of our favorite accessories for keeping phones, tablets and computers charged up and connected. These devices earn high marks in our testing and we recommend them in our guides to wireless chargers, MagSafe power banks, iPad accessories and more. We've seen deals come and go over the past weeks as retailers get their pricing in line for the shopping holiday, so if you don't see what you want right now, check back closer to the actual date for the really good Anker Black Friday deals.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors — unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. More Black Friday tech deals GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

          "standfirst": "The SanDisk 256GB microSD Express Card for the Switch 2 is down to $60 via Amazon, which is a record-low price. This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB, but neither version is on sale. This particular model easily made our list of the best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2. It even made our list of the best Switch 2 accessories. It just gets the job done. We loved the speed on offer here.

          "standfirst": "Nintendo gear is always sought after during the holiday shopping season, but this year likely more so than others. The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones. Joy-Con 2 bundle Nintendo Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Switch 2 Pro Controller Nintendo Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Switch 2 Camera Nintendo Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Hori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera Amazon Best Buy Joy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) Nintendo Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

          "standfirst": "A new artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of the world&#x27;s most widely used computer vision library has emerged from stealth with technology that generates realistic human-centric videos up to five minutes long — a dramatic leap beyond the capabilities of rivals including OpenAI&#x27;s Sora and Google&#x27;s Veo.CraftStory, which launched Tuesday with $2 million in funding, is introducing Model 2.0, a video generation system that addresses one of the most significant limitations plaguing the nascent AI video industry: duration. While OpenAI&#x27;s Sora 2 tops out at 25 seconds and most competing models generate clips of 10 seconds or less, CraftStory&#x27;s system can produce continuous, coherent video performances that run as long as a typical YouTube tutorial or product demonstration.The breakthrough could unlock substantial commercial value for enterprises struggling to scale video production for training, marketing, and customer education — markets where brief AI-generated clips have proven inadequate despite their visual polish.\"If you really try to create a video with one of these video generation systems, you find that a lot of the times you want to implement a certain creative vision, and regardless of how detailed the instructions are, the systems basically ignore a part of your instructions,\" said Victor Erukhimov, CraftStory&#x27;s founder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"We developed a system that can generate videos basically as long as you need them.\"How parallel processing solves the long-form video problemCraftStory&#x27;s advance rests on what the company describes as a parallelized diffusion architecture — a fundamentally different approach to how AI models generate video compared to the sequential methods employed by most competitors.Traditional video generation models work by running diffusion algorithms on increasingly large three-dimensional volumes where time represents the third axis. To generate a longer video, these models require proportionally larger networks, more training data, and significantly more computational resources.CraftStory instead runs multiple smaller diffusion algorithms simultaneously across the entire duration of the video, with bidirectional constraints connecting them. \"The latter part of the video can influence the former part of the video too,\" Erukhimov explained. \"And this is pretty important, because if you do it one by one, then an artifact that appears in the first part propagates to the second one, and then it accumulates.\"Rather than generating eight seconds and then stitching on additional segments, CraftStory&#x27;s system processes all five minutes concurrently through interconnected diffusion processes.Crucially, CraftStory trained its model on proprietary footage rather than relying solely on internet-scraped videos. The company hired studios to shoot actors using high-frame-rate camera systems that capture crisp detail even in fast-moving elements like fingers — avoiding the motion blur inherent in standard 30-frames-per-second YouTube clips.\"What we showed is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of data and you don&#x27;t need a lot of training budget to create high quality videos,\" Erukhimov said. \"You just need high quality data.\"Model 2.0 currently operates as a video-to-video system: users upload a still image to animate and a \"driving video\" containing a person whose movements the AI will replicate. CraftStory provides preset driving videos shot with professional actors, who receive revenue shares when their motion data is used, or users can upload their own footage.The system generates 30-second clips at low resolution in approximately 15 minutes. An advanced lip-sync system synchronizes mouth movements to scripts or audio tracks, while gesture alignment algorithms ensure body language matches speech rhythm and emotional tone.Fighting a war chest battle with $2 million against billionsCraftStory&#x27;s funding comes almost entirely from Andrew Filev, who sold his project management software company Wrike to Citrix for $2.25 billion in 2021 and now runs Zencoder, an AI coding company. The modest raise stands in stark contrast to the billions flowing into competing efforts — OpenAI has raised over $6 billion in its latest funding round alone.Erukhimov pushed back on the notion that massive capital is prerequisite for success. \"I don&#x27;t necessarily buy the thesis that compute is the path to success,\" he said. \"It definitely helps if you have compute. But if you raise a billion dollars on a PowerPoint, in the end, no one is happy, neither the founders nor the investors.\"Filev defended the David-versus-Goliath approach. \"When you invest in startups, you&#x27;re fundamentally betting on people,\" he said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"To paraphrase Margaret Mead: never underestimate what a small group of thoughtful, committed engineers and scientists can build.\"He argued that CraftStory benefits from a focused strategy. \"The big labs are in an arms race to build general-purpose video foundation models,\" Filev said. \"CraftStory is riding that wave and going very deep into a specific format: long-form, engaging, human-centric video.\"Why computer vision expertise matters in generative AI videoErukhimov&#x27;s credibility stems from his deep roots in computer vision rather than the transformer architectures that have dominated recent AI advances. He was an early contributor to OpenCV — the Open Source Computer Vision Library that has become the de facto standard for computer vision applications, with over 84,000 stars on GitHub.When Intel reduced its support for OpenCV in the mid-2000s, Erukhimov co-founded Itseez with the explicit goal of maintaining and advancing the library. The company expanded OpenCV significantly and pivoted toward automotive safety systems before Intel acquired it in 2016.Filev said this background is precisely what makes Erukhimov well-positioned for video generation. \"What people sometimes miss is that generative AI video isn&#x27;t just about the generative part. It&#x27;s about understanding motion, facial dynamics, temporal coherence, and how humans actually move,\" Filev said. \"Victor has spent his career mastering exactly those problems.\"Enterprise focus targets training videos and product demosWhile much of the public excitement around AI video generation has centered on creative tools for consumers, CraftStory is pursuing a decidedly enterprise-focused strategy.\"We are definitely thinking about B2B more than consumer,\" Erukhimov said. \"We&#x27;re thinking about companies, specifically software companies, being able to make cool training videos and product videos and launch videos.\"The logic is straightforward: corporate training, product tutorials, and customer education videos often run several minutes and require consistent quality throughout. A 10-second AI clip cannot effectively demonstrate how to use enterprise software or explain a complex product feature.\"If you need a longer-form video, then you should go with us,\" Erukhimov said. \"We can create up to five minutes, consistent video, high quality.\"Filev echoed this assessment. \"One huge gap in this market is the lack of models that can generate consistent videos over longer sequences — and that&#x27;s extremely important for real-world use,\" he said. \"If you&#x27;re creating a commercial for your company, a 10-second video, no matter how good it looks, just isn&#x27;t enough. You need 30 seconds, you need two minutes — you need more.\"The company anticipates cost savings for customers. Filev suggested that \"a small business owner could create content in minutes that previously would have cost $20,000 and taken two months to produce.\"CraftStory is also courting creative agencies that produce video content for corporate clients, with the value proposition centered on cost and speed: agencies can record an actor on camera and transform that footage into a finished AI video, rather than managing expensive multi-day shoots.The next major development on CraftStory&#x27;s roadmap is a text-to-video model that would allow users to generate long-form content directly from scripts. The team is also developing support for moving-camera scenarios, including the popular \"walk-and-talk\" format common in high-end advertising.Where CraftStory fits in a fragmented competitive landscapeCraftStory enters a crowded and rapidly evolving market.

Runway, Pika, and Stability AI all offer video generation tools with different capabilities.Erukhimov acknowledged the competitive pressure but emphasized that CraftStory serves a distinct niche focused on human-centric videos. He positioned rapid innovation and market capture as the company&#x27;s primary strategy rather than relying on technical moats.Filev sees the market fragmenting into distinct layers, with large tech companies serving as \"API providers of powerful, general-purpose generation models\" while specialized players like CraftStory focus on specific use cases. \"If the big players are building the engines, CraftStory is building the production studio and assembly line on top,\" he said.Model 2.0 is available now at app.craftstory.com/model-2.0, with the company offering early access to users and enterprises interested in testing the technology.

Porsche's gas-powered crossover SUV is its best-selling machine in the US, so it's an absolutely vital piece of the company's success. It's also Porsche's second full-on, battery-powered machine to hit the market. The Macan Electric doesn't replace its internal combustion predecessor, rather living alongside it on the dealership floor, creating a brutal sibling rivalry and a potentially difficult choice for buyers: gas or electric? Actually, Porsche made it a pretty easy decision. This is the right one. Hardware tour The Macan Electric shares a silhouette and a segment with that other Macan, but from a technology standpoint, there's little the two agree upon. The Macan Electric is built on a new platform called PPE, which at one point was destined to be the underpinnings of a smorgasbord of electrified offerings from both Porsche and Audi, including the A6 E-Tron and Q6 E-Tron. For now, at least, Americans' increasingly fickle attitudes toward EVs have stymied some of those plans, meaning this Macan and the upcoming Cayenne Electric are the only two Porsches built from those bones. The Macan is the smaller of the two, powered by a variety of different configurations, starting with a single-motor, rear-drive configuration with 355 horsepower on the low end, up to the 630-hp, dual-motor Macan Turbo Electric on the high end. Buyers can also select the dual-motor Macan 4 Electric, speedier 4S Electric or quicker still GTS Electric. I tested a base Macan Electric, its rear-mounted, 355-hp motor enough to scoot this 5,004-pound SUV from zero to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. The top-shelf Macan Turbo Electric gets to 60 in 3.1 seconds, absolutely humiliating the quickest exhaust-spewing Macan GTS's 4.3-second time. At first glance, the electric Macan looks like a Tesla Model Y -- especially in dark blue. Tim Stevens for Engadget Of course, this is a Porsche, not a drag machine, and so cornering is key. Helping with the handling is an adaptive air suspension that not only lets you go from stiff to firm at the twist of a knob but also raises or lowers dynamically. When you're hunting for range or speed, the SUV gets down into an aerodynamic tuck low to the earth. If you're looking to head off-road, it'll hike itself up by 1.6 inches. While I wouldn't consider this an off-roader as such, the dual motor configurations should be competent in lower-grip situations. Open differentials at either end will keep your all-roading aspirations limited, but on some icy, slippery roads during the week I spent living with one, even the rear-drive Macan proved sure-footed and easy to handle, despite its summer-oriented Pilot Sport EV tires. At the heart of all that is a 100-kilowatt-hour battery, which offers the Macan Electric an EPA-rated range of up to 315 miles, depending on which trim you go with. In my testing, which included extended periods of driving with my foot flat to the floor, I managed 2.8 miles per kWh. That's a theoretical maximum range of 280 miles if you're driving like you stole it. Anyone doing the school run in a more sedate way will have no problem meeting or beating that EPA rating. User interface The Macan's interior is equipped with multiple displays. Tim Stevens for Engadget Beyond performance, the Macan Electric has another advantage over its internal combustion counterpart: it has a more modern interior. The highlight is the 12.6-inch, curved gauge cluster. Using buttons on the steering wheel, you can cycle through various views and telemetry elements to suit your desire for data or need to remain undisturbed. That's paired with a 10.9-inch touchscreen in the middle, and you can even opt for a third display embedded way over on the right side of the dashboard. This one allows you to access streaming services like YouTube. I've never seen the point in that, though, but that's only because I've yet to meet a passenger who wouldn't rather just use their smartphone. Porsche's PCM interface on that central touchscreen is simple and clean, with more than a passing iOS resemblance. Perhaps that's why the company has been an early adopter of CarPlay Ultra. For the Android faithful, wireless Android Auto is here too, and it works great, looking nearly native on the widescreen display. The Macan's gauge cluster is a curved 12.6-inch display. Tim Stevens for Engadget Through simple menus, you can do everything from track lap times to enable or disable the augmented digital engine tone, which Porsche calls Electronic Sport Sound. I confess the futuristic whirring and whooshing does make driving aggressively a bit more fun, but most of the time I prefer to have it off. Thankfully, not everything is controlled through the touchscreen. There's a separate, capacitive-touch panel just below it for climate-related functions, including toggling the prodigiously warm heated seats (which I'm enjoying as I write this). You'll find a physical volume knob there, too. The Macan seats five comfortably, though I'd stick to four for anything longer than a quick run to a team lunch. Front and rear seats are comfortable, and there's a tolerable amount of legroom in the back. Headroom back there, though, is limited. If you have tall co-workers, they'll be tripping over each other to call shotgun. Dynamics Despite it's size, the Macan is surprisingly agile, which is partly due to its unique suspension. Tim Stevens for Engadget In the grand spectrum of SUVs on the roads today, the 188.3-inch-long Macan Electric is on the smaller side. But, as an EV, it's heavy for a crossover. At just a tick over 5,000 pounds, it's a substantial 850 pounds heavier than a regular base Macan. Porsche's engineers addressed that as best they could with the aforementioned fancy suspension, plus larger, 20-inch wheels on each corner. The result is an SUV that is, in Sport or Sport Plus modes, remarkably fun to drive. Its steering is extremely quick for an SUV, which makes this thing feel lighter than it is. All the grip provided by those tires and suspension really gives you the confidence to push through the corners, too. And, when you push too hard, it breaks away quickly and predictably. I enjoyed romping on the throttle hard mid-corner to kick the tail out, the Macan giving me just enough time to grin and give a bit of a steering correction before everything was right and the tires were stuck again. It's not a sports car, no doubt about that, and it tends to wallow a bit on bumpy roads thanks to all that weight, but it is far more engaging and fun than just about anything else in this category. Even this base model is quick off the line, but its breakneck initial throttle response is tempered by a somewhat flat acceleration at higher speeds. It just doesn't have the kind of Autobahn-dominating top-end that Porsches are typically known for. The electric Macan's biggest flaw is the complete lack of lift-off regenerative braking. Tim Stevens for Engadget I suppose I'd have to cough up the extra $10,000 for the GTS, or a further $20,000 for the $109,000 Turbo if I really wanted that. Yes, these things get expensive quick. The base Macan Electric I drove started at $73,500, but carried enough options to drive its out-the-door price to $86,865. You are, at least, getting a machine that readily does double-duty. Despite its responsiveness and eager handling, the Macan Electric does a stellar job of settling down when you twist that Drive Mode knob on the steering wheel to the left, unwinding the suspension and relaxing the experience. The SUV manages excellent compliance over broken roads, flying over railroad tracks without complaint, and just generally being a calm and competent cruiser. But there's one, undeniable flaw that drove me absolutely nuts in the Macan Electric: a complete lack of lift-off regenerative braking. Porsche continues its adamant refusal to offer anything even approaching a one-pedal driving experience. That's a frustrating thing to me — maybe not quite as frustrating as GM phasing out Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but pretty close. Wrap-up The electric Macan commands (at least) a $10,000 premium over its gas-powered sibling. Tim Stevens for Engadget After driving a few different prototypes of the Macan Electric during its development phase, I very much enjoyed my time with a final, production version on some familiar roads around my home. It excelled in the dry and on slippery, early winter roads, made me smile when I was feeling rowdy, and then disappeared into the background when I just wanted to get home. It isn't a perfect machine. I'd hoped for a little more roominess inside, I lament the lack of one-pedal driving, and honestly, I wish Porsche's exterior designers had gone a little crazier. At a quick glance, it looks a lot like a first-gen Tesla Model Y, especially in Gentian Blue Metallic, which is a dead ringer for Tesla's Deep Blue Metallic. And there's also the significant premium that you'll have to pay to get into one: $10,000 over a base, gas-powered Macan. For that, you're getting a lot of extra performance, a dose of extra tech and all the joys and simplicities that come with living the EV lifestyle. That makes it well worth it in my book.

          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

At first glance, Read AI resembles apps like Otter.ai. You can use the software to transcribe and summarize meetings, but it's also more ambitious than that. \"It's AI on standby,\" Read AI CEO David Shim explains, adding that the company's vision is to give people a tool that can record, transcribe and analyze nearly every professional conversation they have, no matter where those discussions take place and whether they occur online or in-person. Today, Read AI is taking a major step toward realizing that vision with the release of its new Operator agent (I'll admit, the company could have picked a more original name), and new apps for Windows, macOS and Android. Between its own software, including an existing iOS app, and third-party integrations, Read AI users can now connect their accounts to more than 22 other platforms. Some of the more notable inclusions there are Gmail, Outlook, Slack, HubSpot and Notion. More importantly, with Read AI's mobile apps, you can record impromptu in-person meetings; the company has data showing that more than half of professional conversations occur outside of online spaces. In any case, no matter where you talk to your colleagues, Operator is there to generate notes and insights. \"We don't just look at meetings,\" Shim says. \"We look at topics that are interesting to you.” To that end, Read AI has built a series of in-house multimodal models that look for context beyond what's said during any interaction you record. For example, the company's systems are designed to catch when you enthusiastically answer a question or look away in disinterest, and use that data to decide how the software goes about summarizing your meetings. \"That context is what enables us to identify what is valuable to you, and make that discoverable,\" says Shim. One way Read AI will surface those insights is through a feature the company calls Monday Brief. At the start of every week, you'll get a summary of all the calls and conversations you had over the last seven days, with suggestions for follow-up actions you can take.Now, you might be wondering, like I was, how Read AI hopes to compete in a market where a company like Microsoft is aggressively pushing Copilot on its users. If Shim is worried about the big players, he doesn't show it. \"There's a need for an independent third party,\" he says. \"There's always something new coming out. And that ability to be the independent third-party that plugs into different solutions is actually what consumers want and need.\" To his point, since the launch of Copilot two years ago, Read AI has seen a 20x increase in the daily number of people using its software alongside Microsoft Teams. \"We've seen the same thing along those lines for Zoom and Google Meet.\" He believes the company's approach to data privacy is another differentiator. By default, users are opted out of their data being used for training Read AI's future models. Shim also notes the company takes recording disclosure seriously. \"You need to notify people that you're [recording] a call, and we put that front and center every single time.\" If you want to try Read AI, the company offers a free plan that includes five meeting transcripts per month.

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums have become ubiquitous over the past few years, in the sense that there are more options to choose from now than ever before. In their early years, you'd have to dish out $500 or more to get a decent robot vacuum, but that's not the case anymore. Sure, you could pick up a $1,000 cleaning behemoth with mopping features, but it would be incorrect to assume that you need to spend that much money to get a good machine.Now, you can get an autonomous dirt-sucker to do one of your least favorite chores (and do it pretty well) by spending $300, or less in some instances. But you get what you pay for in this space; don’t expect affordable robot vacuum cleaners to have all of the bells and whistles that premium machines do, like self-emptying capabilities or advanced dirt detection. Engadget has tested dozens of robot vacuums at various price points over the years and we've narrowed down the best budget robot vacuums you can get right now. Table of contents Best budget robot vacuums for 2025 Are robot vacuums worth it? What to look for in a budget robot vacuum How we test robot vacuums Robot vacuum maintenance tips Budget robot vacuum FAQs Best budget robot vacuums for 2025 Are robot vacuums worth it? Since I've tested dozens of robot vacuums, I'm often asked if these gadgets are \"worth it\" and I'd say the answer is yes. The biggest thing they offer is convenience: just turn on a robot vacuum and walk away. The machine will take care of the rest. If vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores, or you just want to spend less time keeping your home tidy, semi-autonomous robotic vacuum is a great investment. Many models, albeit more expensive ones, even come with features like a self-empty station to further reduce maintenance. There are plenty of other good things about them, but before we dive in let’s consider the biggest trade-offs: less power, less capacity and less flexibility. Those first two go hand in hand; robot vacuum cleaners are much smaller than upright vacuums, which leads to less powerful suction. They also hold less dirt because their built-in bins are a fraction of the size of a standard vacuum canister or bag. Fortunately, some models include features like an auto-empty station, which helps with dirt capacity, especially in homes with pet hair. When it comes to flexibility, robot vacuums do things differently than standard ones. You can control some with your smartphone, set cleaning schedules and more, but robo-vacs are primarily tasked with cleaning floors. On the flip side, their upright counterparts can come with various attachments that let you clean couches, stairs, light fixtures and other hard-to-reach places. What to look for in a budget robot vacuum When looking for the best cheap robot vacuum, one of the first things you should consider is the types of floors you have in your home. Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums. So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you're dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance. You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range. Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it. You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules. But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option. Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes. How we test robot vacuums When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more. Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it's ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. Budget robot vacuum FAQs Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair? Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a cordless vacuum since those tend to be more powerful overall. How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge? Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power. Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors? Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors. Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features? Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you're thinking of buying and look for \"smart mapping\" or \"smart home mapping\" in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.

Do you have mostly carpet, tile, laminate, hardwood? Carpets demand vacuums with strong suction power that can pick up debris pushed down into nooks and crannies. Unfortunately, there isn’t a universal metric by which suction is measured. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger. But other companies don’t rely on Pa levels and simply say their bots have X-times more suction power than other robot vacuums. So how can you ensure you’re getting the best cheap robot vacuum to clean your floor type? Read the product description. Look for details about its ability to clean hard floors and carpets, and see if it has a “max” mode you can use to increase suction. If you are given a Pa measurement, look for around 2000Pa if you have mostly carpeted floors. Pay attention to the brush roll mechanism as well, especially if you're dealing with dog hair or other stubborn debris that can cause tangles. Many budget models use bristle brushes, while others offer tangle-free designs to minimize maintenance. You may find some budget robot vacuums also offer vacuum/mop combo capabilities. These bots feature a water tank, which means they can offer mopping functionality, enhancing debris pickup, and resulting in shiny floors. However, these are less common when you’re shopping in the lower price range. Size is also important for two reasons: clearance and dirt storage. Check the specs for the robot’s height to see if it can get underneath the furniture you have in your home. Most robo-vacs won’t be able to clean under a couch (unless it’s a very tall, very strange couch), but some can get under entryway tables, nightstands and the like. As for dirt storage, look out for the milliliter capacity of the robot’s dustbin — the bigger the capacity, the more dirt the vacuum cleaner can collect before you have to empty it. You should also double check the Wi-Fi capabilities of the robo-vac you’re eyeing. While you may think that’s a given on all smart home devices, it’s not. Some of the most affordable models don’t have the option to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If you choose a robot vac like this, you won’t be able to direct it with a smartphone app or with voice controls. Another feature that’s typically reserved for Wi-Fi-connected robots is scheduling because most of them use a mobile app to set cleaning schedules. But Wi-Fi-incapable vacuums usually come with remote controls that have all the basic functions that companion mobile apps do, including start, stop and return to dock. And if you’re concerned about the possibility of hacking, a robot vac with no access to your Wi-Fi network is the best option. Obstacle detection and cliff sensors are other key features to look out for. The former helps the robot vacuum navigate around furniture while it cleans, rather than mindlessly pushing its way into it. Many also offer no-go zones, letting you block off areas you don’t want the robot to enter. Meanwhile, cliff sensors prevent robot vacuums from tumbling down the stairs, making them the best vacuum for multi-level homes. How we test robot vacuums When we consider which robot vacuums to test, we look at each machine’s specs and feature list, as well as online reviews to get a general idea of its capabilities. With each robot vacuum we review, we set it up as per the instructions and use it for as long as possible — at minimum, we’ll use each for one week, running cleaning cycles daily. We make sure to try out any physical buttons the machine has on it, and any app-power features like scheduling, robot mapping and more. Since we test robot vacuums in our own homes, there are obstacles already in the machine’s way like tables, chairs and other furniture — this helps us understand how capable the machine is at avoiding obstacles, and we’ll intentionally throw smaller items in their way like shoes, pet toys and more. With robot vacuums that include self-emptying bases, we assess how loud the machine is while emptying contents into the base and roughly how long it takes for us to fill up the bag (or bagless) base with debris. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job, or use a self-empty station if the model supports it. Simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning, and then reattach it so it's ready to go for the next time. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brushes to see if any human or pet hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller, side brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangles or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. If you have a robot vacuum with mopping capabilities, you’ll need to wash the bots’ mop pads too, to avoid any unpleasant smells or tracking mess around your home. Similarly, if your robot vacuum has a water tank, it’s worth washing this out regularly to keep it clean. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. Budget robot vacuum FAQs Are budget robot vacuums good for pet hair? Yes, budget robot vacuums can be good for pet hair. Just keep in mind they generally tend to have lower suction power and smaller dustbins than more expensive (and larger) robot vacuums. If pet hair is your biggest concern, we recommend getting as expensive of a robot vacuum as your budget allows, or consider investing in a cordless vacuum since those tend to be more powerful overall. How long do budget robot vacuums last per charge? Budget robot vacuums typically last 40-60 minutes per charge, and the best ones will automatically return to their charging dock when they need more power. Do budget robot vacuums work on carpets and hardwood floors? Yes, budget robot vacuums work on both carpets and hardwood floors. Which budget robot vacuums have mapping features? Home mapping features are typically exclusive to more expensive robot vacuums. Check the product description of any robot vacuum you're thinking of buying and look for \"smart mapping\" or \"smart home mapping\" in the feature list if you want a device that supports it.

To get a high-end gaming experience, you can easily spend $5,000 on a fully tricked-out notebook like the Razer Blade 18. But when it comes to the best budget gaming laptops, we're focusing on the other end of the pricing spectrum: laptops under $1,000. Rising prices due to tariffs and a more chaotic economy has made it tougher to find these inexpensive gems, but they’re still around if you look hard enough. Stepping up a bit to systems between $1,400 and $2,000 puts you firmly in mid-range territory, which is beyond the scope of this guide. Still, it's worth keeping an eye out for sales that can push those higher-end models below $1,000. Be sure to check out our guide to the best gaming laptops for a general overview of what to look out for in these more expensive systems. Are cheap gaming laptops worth it? Cheap gaming laptops are definitely worth it if you’re trying to save money and are being realistic about what you can get at this price range. You can expect to find Intel and AMD's latest (but not greatest) CPUs, as well as entry-level GPUs like NVIDIA's RTX 4050. Budget models are also typically paired with FHD (1080p) screens running at a respectably high refresh rate of 120Hz or beyond — ensuring smooth frame rates in your favorite games. You’ll occasionally see some 16-inch budget options, like Alienware’s Aurora 16 when it dips below $1,000 on sale. Many cheap gaming laptops also skimp on specs like RAM and hard drive space. We'd recommend getting at least 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage at a minimum. Modern games need a decent chunk of memory to run, and they also tend to be large, so you wouldn't be able to fit much alongside Windows 11 on a 256B SSD. You might be tempted to jump on one of those dirt-cheap gaming laptop deals from Walmart or Best Buy, but it's just not worth it if you're stuck with 8GB of RAM or a tiny SSD. You can’t upgrade those components down the line, which gives super-cheap laptops a short lifespan. As for build quality, expect to find more plastic than metal on budget gaming machines. Still, the best budget gaming laptops we're recommending should be sturdy enough to last a few years. Affordable systems will also be heavier and thicker than mid-range and higher-end models, and often don’t have the best Wi-Fi or connectivity options. Battery life is another trade-off, though even the most expensive gaming laptops can struggle with longevity.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-budget-gaming-laptop-130004199.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Musk's xAI launches Grok 4.1 with lower hallucination rate on the web and apps — no API access (for now)",
          "standfirst": "In what appeared to be a bid to soak up some of Google&#x27;s limelight prior to the launch of its new Gemini 3 flagship AI model — now recorded as the most powerful LLM in the world by multiple independent evaluators — Elon Musk&#x27;s rival AI startup xAI last night unveiled its newest large language model, Grok 4.1.The model is now live for consumer use on Grok.com, social network X (formerly Twitter), and the company’s iOS and Android mobile apps, and it arrives with major architectural and usability enhancements, among them: faster reasoning, improved emotional intelligence, and significantly reduced hallucination rates. xAI also published a white paper on its evaluations and including a small bit on training process here. Across public benchmarks, Grok 4.1 has vaulted to the top of the leaderboard, outperforming rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google — at least, Google&#x27;s pre-Gemini 3 model (Gemini 2.5 Pro). It builds upon the success of xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 Fast, which VentureBeat covered favorably shortly following its release back in September 2025.However, enterprise developers looking to integrate the new and improved model Grok 4.1 into production environments will find one major constraint: It&#x27;s not yet available through xAI’s public API. Despite its high benchmarks, Grok 4.1 remains confined to xAI’s consumer-facing interfaces, with no announced timeline for API exposure. At present, only older models — including Grok 4 Fast (reasoning and non-reasoning variants), Grok 4 0709, and legacy models such as Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, and Grok 2 Vision — are available for programmatic use via the xAI developer API. These support up to 2 million tokens of context, with token pricing ranging from $0.20 to $3.00 per million depending on the configuration.For now, this limits Grok 4.1’s utility in enterprise workflows that rely on backend integration, fine-tuned agentic pipelines, or scalable internal tooling. While the consumer rollout positions Grok 4.1 as the most capable LLM in xAI’s portfolio, production deployments in enterprise environments remain on hold.Model design and deployment strategyGrok 4.1 arrives in two configurations: a fast-response, low-latency mode for immediate replies, and a “thinking” mode that engages in multi-step reasoning before producing output. Both versions are live for end users and are selectable via the model picker in xAI’s apps.The two configurations differ not just in latency but also in how deeply the model processes prompts. Grok 4.1 Thinking leverages internal planning and deliberation mechanisms, while the standard version prioritizes speed. Despite the difference in architecture, both scored higher than any competing models in blind preference and benchmark testing.Leading the field in human and expert evaluationOn the LMArena Text Arena leaderboard, Grok 4.1 Thinking briefly held the top position with a normalized Elo score of 1483 — then was dethroned a few hours later with Google&#x27;s release of Gemini 3 and its incredible 1501 Elo score. The non-thinking version of Grok 4.1 also fares well on the index, however, at 1465. These scores place Grok 4.1 above Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 series, and OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 preview.In creative writing, Grok 4.1 ranks second only to Polaris Alpha (an early GPT-5.1 variant), with the “thinking” model earning a score of 1721.9 on the Creative Writing v3 benchmark. This marks a roughly 600-point improvement over previous Grok iterations. Similarly, in the Arena Expert leaderboard, which aggregates feedback from professional reviewers, Grok 4.1 Thinking again leads the field with a score of 1510.The gains are especially notable given that Grok 4.1 was released only two months after Grok 4 Fast, highlighting the accelerated development pace at xAI.Core improvements over previous generationsTechnically, Grok 4.1 represents a significant leap in real-world usability. Visual capabilities — previously limited in Grok 4 — have been upgraded to enable robust image and video understanding, including chart analysis and OCR-level text extraction. Multimodal reliability was a pain point in prior versions and has now been addressed.Token-level latency has been reduced by approximately 28% while preserving reasoning depth. In long-context tasks, Grok 4.1 maintains coherent output up to 1 million tokens, improving on Grok 4’s tendency to degrade past the 300,000 token mark.xAI has also improved the model&#x27;s tool orchestration capabilities. Grok 4.1 can now plan and execute multiple external tools in parallel, reducing the number of interaction cycles required to complete multi-step queries. According to internal test logs, some research tasks that previously required four steps can now be completed in one or two.Other alignment improvements include better truth calibration — reducing the tendency to hedge or soften politically sensitive outputs — and more natural, human-like prosody in voice mode, with support for different speaking styles and accents.Safety and adversarial robustnessAs part of its risk management framework, xAI evaluated Grok 4.1 for refusal behavior, hallucination resistance, sycophancy, and dual-use safety.The hallucination rate in non-reasoning mode has dropped from 12.09% in Grok 4 Fast to just 4.22% — a roughly 65% improvement.The model also scored 2.97% on FActScore, a factual QA benchmark, down from 9.89% in earlier versions.In the domain of adversarial robustness, Grok 4.1 has been tested with prompt injection attacks, jailbreak prompts, and sensitive chemistry and biology queries. Safety filters showed low false negative rates, especially for restricted chemical knowledge (0.00%) and restricted biological queries (0.03%). The model’s ability to resist manipulation in persuasion benchmarks, such as MakeMeSay, also appears strong—it registered a 0% success rate as an attacker.Limited enterprise access via APIDespite these gains, Grok 4.1 remains unavailable to enterprise users through xAI’s API. According to the company’s public documentation, the latest available models for developers are Grok 4 Fast (both reasoning and non-reasoning variants), each supporting up to 2 million tokens of context at pricing tiers ranging from $0.20 to $0.50 per million tokens. These are backed by a 4M tokens-per-minute throughput limit and 480 requests per minute (RPM) rate cap.By contrast, Grok 4.1 is accessible only through xAI’s consumer-facing properties—X, Grok.com, and the mobile apps. This means organizations cannot yet deploy Grok 4.1 via fine-tuned internal workflows, multi-agent chains, or real-time product integrations.Industry reception and next stepsThe release has been met with strong public and industry feedback. Elon Musk, founder of xAI, posted a brief endorsement, calling it “a great model” and congratulating the team.

Grok 4.1’s performance represents a breakthrough for general-purpose and creative tasks, but until API access is enabled, it will remain a consumer-first product with limited enterprise applicability.As competitive models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic continue to evolve, xAI’s next strategic move may hinge on when — and how — it opens Grok 4.1 to external developers.",
          "content": "In what appeared to be a bid to soak up some of Google&#x27;s limelight prior to the launch of its new Gemini 3 flagship AI model — now recorded as the most powerful LLM in the world by multiple independent evaluators — Elon Musk&#x27;s rival AI startup xAI last night unveiled its newest large language model, Grok 4.1.The model is now live for consumer use on Grok.com, social network X (formerly Twitter), and the company’s iOS and Android mobile apps, and it arrives with major architectural and usability enhancements, among them: faster reasoning, improved emotional intelligence, and significantly reduced hallucination rates. xAI also published a white paper on its evaluations and including a small bit on training process here. Across public benchmarks, Grok 4.1 has vaulted to the top of the leaderboard, outperforming rival models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google — at least, Google&#x27;s pre-Gemini 3 model (Gemini 2.5 Pro). It builds upon the success of xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 Fast, which VentureBeat covered favorably shortly following its release back in September 2025.However, enterprise developers looking to integrate the new and improved model Grok 4.1 into production environments will find one major constraint: It&#x27;s not yet available through xAI’s public API. Despite its high benchmarks, Grok 4.1 remains confined to xAI’s consumer-facing interfaces, with no announced timeline for API exposure. At present, only older models — including Grok 4 Fast (reasoning and non-reasoning variants), Grok 4 0709, and legacy models such as Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, and Grok 2 Vision — are available for programmatic use via the xAI developer API. These support up to 2 million tokens of context, with token pricing ranging from $0.20 to $3.00 per million depending on the configuration.For now, this limits Grok 4.1’s utility in enterprise workflows that rely on backend integration, fine-tuned agentic pipelines, or scalable internal tooling. While the consumer rollout positions Grok 4.1 as the most capable LLM in xAI’s portfolio, production deployments in enterprise environments remain on hold.Model design and deployment strategyGrok 4.1 arrives in two configurations: a fast-response, low-latency mode for immediate replies, and a “thinking” mode that engages in multi-step reasoning before producing output. Both versions are live for end users and are selectable via the model picker in xAI’s apps.The two configurations differ not just in latency but also in how deeply the model processes prompts. Grok 4.1 Thinking leverages internal planning and deliberation mechanisms, while the standard version prioritizes speed. Despite the difference in architecture, both scored higher than any competing models in blind preference and benchmark testing.Leading the field in human and expert evaluationOn the LMArena Text Arena leaderboard, Grok 4.1 Thinking briefly held the top position with a normalized Elo score of 1483 — then was dethroned a few hours later with Google&#x27;s release of Gemini 3 and its incredible 1501 Elo score. The non-thinking version of Grok 4.1 also fares well on the index, however, at 1465. These scores place Grok 4.1 above Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 series, and OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 preview.In creative writing, Grok 4.1 ranks second only to Polaris Alpha (an early GPT-5.1 variant), with the “thinking” model earning a score of 1721.9 on the Creative Writing v3 benchmark. This marks a roughly 600-point improvement over previous Grok iterations. Similarly, in the Arena Expert leaderboard, which aggregates feedback from professional reviewers, Grok 4.1 Thinking again leads the field with a score of 1510.The gains are especially notable given that Grok 4.1 was released only two months after Grok 4 Fast, highlighting the accelerated development pace at xAI.Core improvements over previous generationsTechnically, Grok 4.1 represents a significant leap in real-world usability. Visual capabilities — previously limited in Grok 4 — have been upgraded to enable robust image and video understanding, including chart analysis and OCR-level text extraction. Multimodal reliability was a pain point in prior versions and has now been addressed.Token-level latency has been reduced by approximately 28% while preserving reasoning depth. In long-context tasks, Grok 4.1 maintains coherent output up to 1 million tokens, improving on Grok 4’s tendency to degrade past the 300,000 token mark.xAI has also improved the model&#x27;s tool orchestration capabilities. Grok 4.1 can now plan and execute multiple external tools in parallel, reducing the number of interaction cycles required to complete multi-step queries. According to internal test logs, some research tasks that previously required four steps can now be completed in one or two.Other alignment improvements include better truth calibration — reducing the tendency to hedge or soften politically sensitive outputs — and more natural, human-like prosody in voice mode, with support for different speaking styles and accents.Safety and adversarial robustnessAs part of its risk management framework, xAI evaluated Grok 4.1 for refusal behavior, hallucination resistance, sycophancy, and dual-use safety.The hallucination rate in non-reasoning mode has dropped from 12.09% in Grok 4 Fast to just 4.22% — a roughly 65% improvement.The model also scored 2.97% on FActScore, a factual QA benchmark, down from 9.89% in earlier versions.In the domain of adversarial robustness, Grok 4.1 has been tested with prompt injection attacks, jailbreak prompts, and sensitive chemistry and biology queries. Safety filters showed low false negative rates, especially for restricted chemical knowledge (0.00%) and restricted biological queries (0.03%). The model’s ability to resist manipulation in persuasion benchmarks, such as MakeMeSay, also appears strong—it registered a 0% success rate as an attacker.Limited enterprise access via APIDespite these gains, Grok 4.1 remains unavailable to enterprise users through xAI’s API. According to the company’s public documentation, the latest available models for developers are Grok 4 Fast (both reasoning and non-reasoning variants), each supporting up to 2 million tokens of context at pricing tiers ranging from $0.20 to $0.50 per million tokens. These are backed by a 4M tokens-per-minute throughput limit and 480 requests per minute (RPM) rate cap.By contrast, Grok 4.1 is accessible only through xAI’s consumer-facing properties—X, Grok.com, and the mobile apps. This means organizations cannot yet deploy Grok 4.1 via fine-tuned internal workflows, multi-agent chains, or real-time product integrations.Industry reception and next stepsThe release has been met with strong public and industry feedback. Elon Musk, founder of xAI, posted a brief endorsement, calling it “a great model” and congratulating the team. AI benchmark platforms have praised the leap in usability and linguistic nuance.For enterprise customers, however, the picture is more mixed. Grok 4.1’s performance represents a breakthrough for general-purpose and creative tasks, but until API access is enabled, it will remain a consumer-first product with limited enterprise applicability.As competitive models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic continue to evolve, xAI’s next strategic move may hinge on when — and how — it opens Grok 4.1 to external developers.",

          "title": "Google unveils Gemini 3 claiming the lead in math, science, multimodal, and agentic AI benchmarks",
          "standfirst": "After more than a month of rumors and feverish speculation — including Polymarket wagering on the release date — Google today unveiled Gemini 3, its newest proprietary frontier model family and the company’s most comprehensive AI release since the Gemini line debuted in 2023. The models are proprietary (closed-source), available exclusively through Google products, developer platforms, and paid APIs, including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini command line interface (CLI) for developers, and third-party integrations across the broader integrated developer environment (IDE) ecosystem.Gemini 3 arrives as a full portfolio:Gemini 3 Pro: the flagship frontier modelGemini 3 Deep Think: an enhanced reasoning modeGenerative interface models powering Visual Layout and Dynamic ViewGemini Agent for multi-step task executionGemini 3 engine embedded in Google Antigravity, the company’s new agent-first development environment.\"This is the best model in the world, by a crazy wide margin!\" wrote Google DeepMind Research Scientist Yi Tay on X. Indeed, already, independent AI benchmarking and analysis organization Artificial Analysis has crowned Gemini 3 Pro the \"new leader in AI\" globally, achieving the top score of 73 on the organization&#x27;s index, leaping Google from its former placement of 9th overall with the preceding Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which scored 60 behind OpenAI, Moonshot AI, xAI, Anthropic and MiniMax models. As Artificial Analysis wrote on X: \"For the first time, Google has the most intelligent model.\"Another independent leaderboard site, LMArena reported that Gemini 3 Pro ranked first in the world across all of its major evaluation tracks, including text reasoning, vision, coding, and web development. In a public post, the @arena account on X said the model surpassed even the newly released (hours old) Grok-4.1, as well as Claude 4.5, and GPT-5-class systems in categories such as math, long-form queries, creative writing, and several occupational benchmarks. The post also highlighted the scale of gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro, including a 50-point jump in text Elo, a 70-point increase in vision, and a 280-point rise in web-development tasks. While these results reflect live community voting and remain preliminary, they signal unusually broad performance improvements across domains where previous Gemini models trailed competitors.What It Means For Google In the Hotly Competitive AI RaceThe launch represents one of Google’s largest, most tightly coordinated model releases. Gemini 3 is shipping simultaneously across Google Search, the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a range of developer tools. Executives emphasized that this integration reflects Google’s control of tensor processing unit (TPU — its homegrown Nvidia GPU rival chips) hardware, data center infrastructure, and consumer products. According to the company, the Gemini app now has more than 650 million monthly active users, more than 13 million developers build with Google’s AI tools, and more than 2 billion monthly users engage with Gemini-powered AI Overviews in Search.At the center of the release is a shift toward agentic AI — systems that plan, act, navigate interfaces, and coordinate tools, rather than just generating text. Gemini 3 is designed to translate high-level instructions into multi-step workflows across devices and applications, with the ability to generate functional interfaces, run tools, and manage complex tasks.Major Performance Gains Over Gemini 2.5 ProGemini 3 Pro introduces large gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro across reasoning, mathematics, multimodality, tool use, coding, and long-horizon planning. Google’s benchmark disclosures show substantial improvements in many categories.Gemini 3 Pro debuted at the top of the LMArena text-reasoning leaderboard, posting a preliminary Elo score of 1501 based on pre-release community voting — the first LLM to ever cross the 1500 threshold.That places it above xAI’s newly announced Grok-4.1-thinking model (1484) and Grok-4.1 (1465), both of which were unveiled just hours earlier, as well as above Gemini 2.5 Pro (1451) and recent Claude Sonnet and Opus releases. While LMArena covers only text-reasoning performance and the results are labeled preliminary, this ranking positions Gemini 3 Pro as the strongest publicly evaluated model on that benchmark as of its launch day — though not necessarily the top performer in the world across all modalities, tasks, or evaluation suites.In mathematical and scientific reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro scored 95% on AIME 2025 without tools and 100% with code execution, compared to 88% for its predecessor. On GPQA Diamond, it reached 91.9%, up from 86.4%. The model also recorded a major jump on MathArena Apex, reaching 23.4% versus 0.5% for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and delivered 31.1% on ARC-AGI-2 compared to 4.9% previously.ARC-AGI-2 is the second-generation version of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark introduced by AI researcher François Chollet to measure generalization, not memorization. Unlike typical multiple-choice or dataset-based evaluations, ARC-AGI-2 presents models with tiny grid-based puzzles that require discovering and applying abstract rules. Each task provides a few input–output examples, and the model must infer the underlying transformation and apply it to a new test case. The problems span visual pattern recognition, symbolic manipulation, object transformations, spatial reasoning, and rule induction — all designed to test reasoning capabilities that do not depend on training-set familiarity.The new ARC-AGI-2 variant is deliberately constructed to be out-of-distribution and resistant to memorization, making it one of the most difficult benchmarks for large language models. Its tasks are engineered to stress-test whether a model can infer a previously unseen rule purely from examples, a proxy for early forms of generalized problem-solving. Astonishingly, the \"Deep Think\" version of Gemini 3, designed to take longer to solve problems and use more reasoning, scored 45.1%, representing a substantial jump over prior frontier models, which typically score in the mid-teens to low-twenties. It also far exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s 31.1% and is an order-of-magnitude improvement over older Gemini releases. These results suggest that Deep Think’s architecture is particularly effective at multi-step hypothesis generation, checking, and revision — the specific capabilities ARC-AGI-2 is designed to measure.Multimodal performance increased across the board. Gemini 3 Pro scored 81% on MMMU-Pro, up from 68%, and 87.6% on Video-MMMU, compared to 83.6%. Its result on ScreenSpot-Pro, a key benchmark for agentic computer use, rose from 11.4% to 72.7%. Document understanding and chart reasoning also improved.Coding and tool-use performance showed equally significant gains. The model’s LiveCodeBench Pro score reached 2,439, up from 1,775. On Terminal-Bench 2.0 it achieved 54.2% versus 32.6% previously. SWE-Bench Verified, which measures agentic coding through structured fixes, increased from 59.6% to 76.2%. The model also posted 85.4% on t2-bench, up from 54.9%.Long-context and planning benchmarks indicate more stable multi-step behavior. Gemini 3 achieved 77% on MRCR v2 at 128k context (versus 58%) and 26.3% at 1 million tokens (versus 16.4%). Its Vending-Bench 2 score reached $5,478.16, compared to $573.64 for Gemini 2.5 Pro, reflecting stronger consistency during long-running decision processes.Language understanding scores improved on SimpleQA Verified (72.1% versus 54.5%), MMLU (91.8% versus 89.5%), and the FACTS Benchmark Suite (70.5% versus 63.4%), supporting more reliable fact-based work in regulated sectors.Generative interfaces move Gemini beyond textGemini 3 introduces a new class of generative interface capabilities in the consumer-facing Google Search AI Mode and for developers through Google AI Studio.Visual Layout produces structured, magazine-style pages with images, diagrams, and modules tailored to the query. Dynamic View generates functional interface components such as calculators, simulations, galleries, and interactive graphs. These experiences will be available starting today globally in Google Search’s AI Mode, enabling models to surface information in visual, interactive formats beyond static text.Developers can reproduce similar UI elements through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API, but the full consumer-facing interface types are not available as direct API outputs; instead, developers receive the underlying code or schema to render these components themselves. The branded Visual Layout and Dynamic View formats are therefore specific to Search and not exposed as standalone API features.Google says the model analyzes user intent to construct the layout best suited to a task. In practice, this includes everything from automatically building diagrams for scientific concepts to generating custom UI components that respond to user input.Google held a press call the day before the Gemini 3 announcement to brief reporters on the model family, its intended use cases, and how it differed from earlier Gemini releases. The call was led by multiple Google and DeepMind executives who walked through the model’s capabilities and framed Gemini 3 as a step toward more reliable, multi-step agentic systems that can operate across Google’s ecosystem.During the briefing, speakers emphasized that Gemini 3 was engineered to support more consistent long-horizon reasoning, better tool use, and smoother planning loops than Gemini 2.5 Pro. One presenter said the model benefits from an architecture that allows it to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses in parallel, improving reliability on mathematically hard questions and complex procedural tasks. Another speaker explained that Gemini 3’s improved spatial reasoning enables more robust interaction with interface elements, which supports agentic workflows across screens and applications.Presenters highlighted growing enterprise adoption, noting strong demand for multimodal analysis, structured document reasoning, and agentic coding tools. They said Gemini 3’s performance on multimodal and scientific benchmarks reflected Google’s focus on grounded, verifiable reasoning. And they discussed Gemini 3&#x27;s safety processes and improvements, including reduced sycophancy, stronger prompt-injection resistance, and a more structured evaluation pipeline guided by Google’s Frontier Safety Framework introduced back in 2024.A portion of the call was dedicated to developer experience. Google described updates to its AI Studio and API that allow developers to control thinking depth, adjust model “resolution,” and combine new grounding tools with URL context and Search. Demoes showed Gemini 3 generating application interfaces, managing tool sequences, and debugging code in Antigravity, illustrating the model’s shift toward agentic operation rather than single-step generation.The call positioned Gemini 3 as an upgrade across reasoning, planning, multimodal understanding, and developer workflows, with Google framing these advances as the foundation for its next generation of agent-driven products and enterprise services.Gemini Agent introduces multistep workflow automationGemini Agent marks Google’s effort to move beyond conversational assistance toward operational AI. The system coordinates multi-step tasks across tools like Gmail, Calendar, Canvas, and live browsing. It reviews inboxes, drafts replies, prepares plans, triages information, and reasons through complex workflows, while requiring user approval before performing sensitive actions.On a press call with journalists ahead of the release yesterday, Google said the agent is designed to handle multi-turn planning and tool-use sequences with consistency that was not feasible in earlier generations. It is rolling out first to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app.Google Antigravity and developer toolchain integrationAntigravity is Google’s new agent-first development environment designed around Gemini 3. Developers collaborate with agents across an editor, terminal, and browser. The system orchestrates full-stack tasks, including code generation, UI prototyping, debugging, live execution, and report generation.Across the broader developer ecosystem, Google AI Studio now includes a Build mode that automatically wires the right models and APIs to speed up AI-native app creation. Annotations support allows developers to attach prompts to UI elements for faster iteration. Spatial reasoning improvements enable agents to interpret mouse movements, screen annotations, and multi-window layouts to operate computer interfaces more effectively.Developers also gain new reasoning controls through “thinking level” and “model resolution” parameters in the Gemini API, along with stricter validation of thought signatures for multi-turn consistency. A hosted server-side bash tool supports secure, multi-language code generation and prototyping. Grounding with Google Search and URL context can now be combined to extract structured information for downstream tasks.Enterprise impact and adoptionEnterprise teams gain multimodal understanding, agentic coding, and long-horizon planning needed for production use cases. The new model unifies analysis of documents, audio, video, workflows, and logs. Improvements in spatial and visual reasoning support robotics, autonomous systems, and scenarios requiring navigation of screens and applications. High-frame-rate video understanding helps developers detect events in fast-moving environments.Gemini 3’s structured document understanding capabilities support legal review, complex form processing, and regulated workflows. Its ability to generate functional interfaces and prototypes with minimal prompting reduces engineering cycles. In addition, the gains in system reliability, tool-calling stability, and context retention make multi-step planning viable for operations like financial forecasting, customer support automation, supply chain modeling, and predictive maintenance.Developer and API pricingGoogle has disclosed initial API pricing for Gemini 3 Pro. In preview, the model is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens for prompts up to 200,000 tokens in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. For prompts that require more than 200,000 tokens, the input pricing doubles to $2 per 1M tok, while the output rises to $18 per 1M tok.When compared to the API pricing for other frontier AI models from rival labs, Gemini 3 is priced in the mid-high range, which may impact adoption as cheaper and open-source (permissively licensed) Chinese models have increasingly come to be adopted by U.S. startups.

Enterprises planning deployment at scale will require these details to estimate operational costs.Multimodal, visual, and spatial reasoning enhancementsGemini 3’s improvements in embodied and spatial reasoning support pointing and trajectory prediction, task progression, and complex screen parsing. These capabilities extend to desktop and mobile environments, enabling agents to interpret screen elements, respond to on-screen context, and unlock new forms of computer-use automation.The model also delivers improved video reasoning with high-frame-rate understanding for analyzing fast-moving scenes, along with long-context video recall for synthesizing narratives across hours of footage. Google’s examples show the model generating full interactive demo apps directly from prompts, illustrating the depth of multimodal and agentic integration.Vibe coding and agentic code generationGemini 3 advances Google’s concept of “vibe coding,” where natural language acts as the primary syntax. The model can translate high-level ideas into full applications with a single prompt, handling multi-step planning, code generation, and visual design. Enterprise partners like Figma, JetBrains, Cursor, Replit, and Cline report stronger instruction following, more stable agentic operation, and better long-context code manipulation compared to prior models.Rumors and rumblingsIn the weeks leading up to the announcement, X became a hub of speculation about Gemini 3. Well-known accounts such as @slow_developer suggested internal builds were significantly ahead of Gemini 2.5 Pro and likely exceeded competitor performance in reasoning and tool use. Others, including @synthwavedd and @VraserX, noted mixed behavior in early checkpoints but acknowledged Google’s advantage in TPU hardware and training data.

          "content": "After more than a month of rumors and feverish speculation — including Polymarket wagering on the release date — Google today unveiled Gemini 3, its newest proprietary frontier model family and the company’s most comprehensive AI release since the Gemini line debuted in 2023. The models are proprietary (closed-source), available exclusively through Google products, developer platforms, and paid APIs, including Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, the Gemini command line interface (CLI) for developers, and third-party integrations across the broader integrated developer environment (IDE) ecosystem.Gemini 3 arrives as a full portfolio:Gemini 3 Pro: the flagship frontier modelGemini 3 Deep Think: an enhanced reasoning modeGenerative interface models powering Visual Layout and Dynamic ViewGemini Agent for multi-step task executionGemini 3 engine embedded in Google Antigravity, the company’s new agent-first development environment.\"This is the best model in the world, by a crazy wide margin!\" wrote Google DeepMind Research Scientist Yi Tay on X. Indeed, already, independent AI benchmarking and analysis organization Artificial Analysis has crowned Gemini 3 Pro the \"new leader in AI\" globally, achieving the top score of 73 on the organization&#x27;s index, leaping Google from its former placement of 9th overall with the preceding Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which scored 60 behind OpenAI, Moonshot AI, xAI, Anthropic and MiniMax models. As Artificial Analysis wrote on X: \"For the first time, Google has the most intelligent model.\"Another independent leaderboard site, LMArena reported that Gemini 3 Pro ranked first in the world across all of its major evaluation tracks, including text reasoning, vision, coding, and web development. In a public post, the @arena account on X said the model surpassed even the newly released (hours old) Grok-4.1, as well as Claude 4.5, and GPT-5-class systems in categories such as math, long-form queries, creative writing, and several occupational benchmarks. The post also highlighted the scale of gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro, including a 50-point jump in text Elo, a 70-point increase in vision, and a 280-point rise in web-development tasks. While these results reflect live community voting and remain preliminary, they signal unusually broad performance improvements across domains where previous Gemini models trailed competitors.What It Means For Google In the Hotly Competitive AI RaceThe launch represents one of Google’s largest, most tightly coordinated model releases. Gemini 3 is shipping simultaneously across Google Search, the Gemini app, Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and a range of developer tools. Executives emphasized that this integration reflects Google’s control of tensor processing unit (TPU — its homegrown Nvidia GPU rival chips) hardware, data center infrastructure, and consumer products. According to the company, the Gemini app now has more than 650 million monthly active users, more than 13 million developers build with Google’s AI tools, and more than 2 billion monthly users engage with Gemini-powered AI Overviews in Search.At the center of the release is a shift toward agentic AI — systems that plan, act, navigate interfaces, and coordinate tools, rather than just generating text. Gemini 3 is designed to translate high-level instructions into multi-step workflows across devices and applications, with the ability to generate functional interfaces, run tools, and manage complex tasks.Major Performance Gains Over Gemini 2.5 ProGemini 3 Pro introduces large gains over Gemini 2.5 Pro across reasoning, mathematics, multimodality, tool use, coding, and long-horizon planning. Google’s benchmark disclosures show substantial improvements in many categories.Gemini 3 Pro debuted at the top of the LMArena text-reasoning leaderboard, posting a preliminary Elo score of 1501 based on pre-release community voting — the first LLM to ever cross the 1500 threshold.That places it above xAI’s newly announced Grok-4.1-thinking model (1484) and Grok-4.1 (1465), both of which were unveiled just hours earlier, as well as above Gemini 2.5 Pro (1451) and recent Claude Sonnet and Opus releases. While LMArena covers only text-reasoning performance and the results are labeled preliminary, this ranking positions Gemini 3 Pro as the strongest publicly evaluated model on that benchmark as of its launch day — though not necessarily the top performer in the world across all modalities, tasks, or evaluation suites.In mathematical and scientific reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro scored 95% on AIME 2025 without tools and 100% with code execution, compared to 88% for its predecessor. On GPQA Diamond, it reached 91.9%, up from 86.4%. The model also recorded a major jump on MathArena Apex, reaching 23.4% versus 0.5% for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and delivered 31.1% on ARC-AGI-2 compared to 4.9% previously.ARC-AGI-2 is the second-generation version of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a benchmark introduced by AI researcher François Chollet to measure generalization, not memorization. Unlike typical multiple-choice or dataset-based evaluations, ARC-AGI-2 presents models with tiny grid-based puzzles that require discovering and applying abstract rules. Each task provides a few input–output examples, and the model must infer the underlying transformation and apply it to a new test case. The problems span visual pattern recognition, symbolic manipulation, object transformations, spatial reasoning, and rule induction — all designed to test reasoning capabilities that do not depend on training-set familiarity.The new ARC-AGI-2 variant is deliberately constructed to be out-of-distribution and resistant to memorization, making it one of the most difficult benchmarks for large language models. Its tasks are engineered to stress-test whether a model can infer a previously unseen rule purely from examples, a proxy for early forms of generalized problem-solving. Astonishingly, the \"Deep Think\" version of Gemini 3, designed to take longer to solve problems and use more reasoning, scored 45.1%, representing a substantial jump over prior frontier models, which typically score in the mid-teens to low-twenties. It also far exceeds Gemini 3 Pro’s 31.1% and is an order-of-magnitude improvement over older Gemini releases. These results suggest that Deep Think’s architecture is particularly effective at multi-step hypothesis generation, checking, and revision — the specific capabilities ARC-AGI-2 is designed to measure.Multimodal performance increased across the board. Gemini 3 Pro scored 81% on MMMU-Pro, up from 68%, and 87.6% on Video-MMMU, compared to 83.6%. Its result on ScreenSpot-Pro, a key benchmark for agentic computer use, rose from 11.4% to 72.7%. Document understanding and chart reasoning also improved.Coding and tool-use performance showed equally significant gains. The model’s LiveCodeBench Pro score reached 2,439, up from 1,775. On Terminal-Bench 2.0 it achieved 54.2% versus 32.6% previously. SWE-Bench Verified, which measures agentic coding through structured fixes, increased from 59.6% to 76.2%. The model also posted 85.4% on t2-bench, up from 54.9%.Long-context and planning benchmarks indicate more stable multi-step behavior. Gemini 3 achieved 77% on MRCR v2 at 128k context (versus 58%) and 26.3% at 1 million tokens (versus 16.4%). Its Vending-Bench 2 score reached $5,478.16, compared to $573.64 for Gemini 2.5 Pro, reflecting stronger consistency during long-running decision processes.Language understanding scores improved on SimpleQA Verified (72.1% versus 54.5%), MMLU (91.8% versus 89.5%), and the FACTS Benchmark Suite (70.5% versus 63.4%), supporting more reliable fact-based work in regulated sectors.Generative interfaces move Gemini beyond textGemini 3 introduces a new class of generative interface capabilities in the consumer-facing Google Search AI Mode and for developers through Google AI Studio.Visual Layout produces structured, magazine-style pages with images, diagrams, and modules tailored to the query. Dynamic View generates functional interface components such as calculators, simulations, galleries, and interactive graphs. These experiences will be available starting today globally in Google Search’s AI Mode, enabling models to surface information in visual, interactive formats beyond static text.Developers can reproduce similar UI elements through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API, but the full consumer-facing interface types are not available as direct API outputs; instead, developers receive the underlying code or schema to render these components themselves. The branded Visual Layout and Dynamic View formats are therefore specific to Search and not exposed as standalone API features.Google says the model analyzes user intent to construct the layout best suited to a task. In practice, this includes everything from automatically building diagrams for scientific concepts to generating custom UI components that respond to user input.Google held a press call the day before the Gemini 3 announcement to brief reporters on the model family, its intended use cases, and how it differed from earlier Gemini releases. The call was led by multiple Google and DeepMind executives who walked through the model’s capabilities and framed Gemini 3 as a step toward more reliable, multi-step agentic systems that can operate across Google’s ecosystem.During the briefing, speakers emphasized that Gemini 3 was engineered to support more consistent long-horizon reasoning, better tool use, and smoother planning loops than Gemini 2.5 Pro. One presenter said the model benefits from an architecture that allows it to generate and evaluate multiple hypotheses in parallel, improving reliability on mathematically hard questions and complex procedural tasks. Another speaker explained that Gemini 3’s improved spatial reasoning enables more robust interaction with interface elements, which supports agentic workflows across screens and applications.Presenters highlighted growing enterprise adoption, noting strong demand for multimodal analysis, structured document reasoning, and agentic coding tools. They said Gemini 3’s performance on multimodal and scientific benchmarks reflected Google’s focus on grounded, verifiable reasoning. And they discussed Gemini 3&#x27;s safety processes and improvements, including reduced sycophancy, stronger prompt-injection resistance, and a more structured evaluation pipeline guided by Google’s Frontier Safety Framework introduced back in 2024.A portion of the call was dedicated to developer experience. Google described updates to its AI Studio and API that allow developers to control thinking depth, adjust model “resolution,” and combine new grounding tools with URL context and Search. Demoes showed Gemini 3 generating application interfaces, managing tool sequences, and debugging code in Antigravity, illustrating the model’s shift toward agentic operation rather than single-step generation.The call positioned Gemini 3 as an upgrade across reasoning, planning, multimodal understanding, and developer workflows, with Google framing these advances as the foundation for its next generation of agent-driven products and enterprise services.Gemini Agent introduces multistep workflow automationGemini Agent marks Google’s effort to move beyond conversational assistance toward operational AI. The system coordinates multi-step tasks across tools like Gmail, Calendar, Canvas, and live browsing. It reviews inboxes, drafts replies, prepares plans, triages information, and reasons through complex workflows, while requiring user approval before performing sensitive actions.On a press call with journalists ahead of the release yesterday, Google said the agent is designed to handle multi-turn planning and tool-use sequences with consistency that was not feasible in earlier generations. It is rolling out first to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app.Google Antigravity and developer toolchain integrationAntigravity is Google’s new agent-first development environment designed around Gemini 3. Developers collaborate with agents across an editor, terminal, and browser. The system orchestrates full-stack tasks, including code generation, UI prototyping, debugging, live execution, and report generation.Across the broader developer ecosystem, Google AI Studio now includes a Build mode that automatically wires the right models and APIs to speed up AI-native app creation. Annotations support allows developers to attach prompts to UI elements for faster iteration. Spatial reasoning improvements enable agents to interpret mouse movements, screen annotations, and multi-window layouts to operate computer interfaces more effectively.Developers also gain new reasoning controls through “thinking level” and “model resolution” parameters in the Gemini API, along with stricter validation of thought signatures for multi-turn consistency. A hosted server-side bash tool supports secure, multi-language code generation and prototyping. Grounding with Google Search and URL context can now be combined to extract structured information for downstream tasks.Enterprise impact and adoptionEnterprise teams gain multimodal understanding, agentic coding, and long-horizon planning needed for production use cases. The new model unifies analysis of documents, audio, video, workflows, and logs. Improvements in spatial and visual reasoning support robotics, autonomous systems, and scenarios requiring navigation of screens and applications. High-frame-rate video understanding helps developers detect events in fast-moving environments.Gemini 3’s structured document understanding capabilities support legal review, complex form processing, and regulated workflows. Its ability to generate functional interfaces and prototypes with minimal prompting reduces engineering cycles. In addition, the gains in system reliability, tool-calling stability, and context retention make multi-step planning viable for operations like financial forecasting, customer support automation, supply chain modeling, and predictive maintenance.Developer and API pricingGoogle has disclosed initial API pricing for Gemini 3 Pro. In preview, the model is priced at $2 per million input tokens and $12 per million output tokens for prompts up to 200,000 tokens in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. For prompts that require more than 200,000 tokens, the input pricing doubles to $2 per 1M tok, while the output rises to $18 per 1M tok.When compared to the API pricing for other frontier AI models from rival labs, Gemini 3 is priced in the mid-high range, which may impact adoption as cheaper and open-source (permissively licensed) Chinese models have increasingly come to be adopted by U.S. startups.

Enterprises planning deployment at scale will require these details to estimate operational costs.Multimodal, visual, and spatial reasoning enhancementsGemini 3’s improvements in embodied and spatial reasoning support pointing and trajectory prediction, task progression, and complex screen parsing. These capabilities extend to desktop and mobile environments, enabling agents to interpret screen elements, respond to on-screen context, and unlock new forms of computer-use automation.The model also delivers improved video reasoning with high-frame-rate understanding for analyzing fast-moving scenes, along with long-context video recall for synthesizing narratives across hours of footage. Google’s examples show the model generating full interactive demo apps directly from prompts, illustrating the depth of multimodal and agentic integration.Vibe coding and agentic code generationGemini 3 advances Google’s concept of “vibe coding,” where natural language acts as the primary syntax. The model can translate high-level ideas into full applications with a single prompt, handling multi-step planning, code generation, and visual design. Enterprise partners like Figma, JetBrains, Cursor, Replit, and Cline report stronger instruction following, more stable agentic operation, and better long-context code manipulation compared to prior models.Rumors and rumblingsIn the weeks leading up to the announcement, X became a hub of speculation about Gemini 3. Well-known accounts such as @slow_developer suggested internal builds were significantly ahead of Gemini 2.5 Pro and likely exceeded competitor performance in reasoning and tool use. Others, including @synthwavedd and @VraserX, noted mixed behavior in early checkpoints but acknowledged Google’s advantage in TPU hardware and training data. Viral clips from users like @lepadphone and @StijnSmits showed the model generating websites, animations, and UI layouts from single prompts, adding to the momentum.Prediction markets on Polymarket amplified the speculation. Whale accounts drove the odds of a mid-November release sharply upward, prompting widespread debate about insider activity. A temporary dip during a global Cloudflare outage became a moment of humor and conspiracy before odds surged again.The key moment came when users including @cheatyyyy shared what appeared to be an internal model-card benchmark table for Gemini 3 Pro. The image circulated rapidly, with commentary from figures like @deedydas and @kimmonismus arguing the numbers suggested a significant lead. When Google published the official benchmarks, they matched the leaked table exactly, confirming the document’s authenticity.By launch day, enthusiasm reached a peak.

          "standfirst": "Writer, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, is launching a unified AI agent platform designed to let any employee automate complex business workflows without writing code — a capability the company says distinguishes it from consumer-oriented tools like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT.The platform, called Writer Agent, combines chat-based assistance with autonomous task execution in a single interface. Starting Tuesday, enterprise customers can use natural language to instruct the AI to create presentations, analyze financial data, generate marketing campaigns, or coordinate across multiple business systems like Salesforce, Slack, and Google Workspace—then save those workflows as reusable \"Playbooks\" that run automatically on schedules.The announcement comes as enterprises struggle to move AI initiatives beyond pilot programs into production at scale. Writer CEO May Habib has been outspoken about this challenge, recently revealing that 42% of Fortune 500 executives surveyed by her company said AI is \"tearing their company apart\" due to coordination failures between departments.\"We&#x27;re delivering an agent interface that is both incredibly powerful and radically simple to transform individual productivity into organizational impact,\" Habib said in a statement. \"Writer Agent is the difference between a single sales rep asking a chatbot to write an outreach email and an enterprise ensuring that 1,000 reps are all sending on-brand, compliant, and contextually-aware messages to target accounts.\"How Writer is putting workflow automation in the hands of non-technical workersThe platform&#x27;s core innovation centers on making workflow automation accessible to non-technical employees—what Writer executives call \"democratizing who gets to be a builder.\"In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Doris Jwo, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, demonstrated how the system works: A user types a request in plain English — for example, \"Create a two-page partnership proposal between [Company A] and [Company B], make it a branded deck, include impact metrics and partnership tiers.\"The AI agent then breaks down that request into discrete steps, conducts web research, generates graphics and charts on the fly, creates individual slides with sourced information, and assembles a complete presentation. The entire process, which might take an employee hours or days, can be completed in 10-12 minutes.\"The agent basically looks at the request, breaks it down, does research, understands what pieces it needs, creates a detailed plan at a step-by-step level,\" Jwo explained during a product demonstration. \"It might say, &#x27;I need to do web research,&#x27; or &#x27;This user needs information from Gong or Slack,&#x27; and it reaches out to those connectors, grabs the data, and executes the plan.\"Crucially, users can save these multi-step processes as Playbooks—reusable templates that colleagues can deploy with a single click. Routines allow those Playbooks to run automatically at scheduled intervals, essentially putting knowledge work \"on autopilot.\"Security and compliance controls: Writer&#x27;s answer to enterprise IT concernsWriter positions these enterprise-focused controls as a key differentiator from competitors. While Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic offer powerful AI capabilities, Writer&#x27;s executives argue those tools weren&#x27;t designed from the ground up for the security, compliance, and governance requirements of large regulated organizations.\"All of the products you mentioned are great products, but even Copilot is very much focused on personal productivity—summarizing email, for example, which is important, but that&#x27;s not the component we&#x27;re focusing on,\" said Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.Shetrit emphasized Writer&#x27;s \"trust, security, and interoperability\" approach. IT administrators can granularly control what the AI can access — for instance, preventing market research agents from mentioning competitors, or restricting which employees can use web search capabilities. All activity is logged with detailed audit trails showing exactly what data the agent touched and what actions it took.\"These fine-grained controls are what make products enterprise-ready,\" Shetrit said. \"We can deploy to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees while maintaining the security and guardrails you need for that scale.\"This architecture reflects Writer&#x27;s origin story. Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic, which started as research labs and later added enterprise offerings, Writer has targeted Fortune 500 companies since its 2020 founding. \"We&#x27;re not a research lab that went to consumer and is dabbling in enterprise,\" Shetrit said. \"We are first and foremost targeting the Global 2000 and Fortune 500, and our research is in service of these customers&#x27; needs.\"Inside Writer&#x27;s strategy to connect AI agents across enterprise software systemsA critical technical component is Writer&#x27;s approach to system integrations. The platform includes pre-built connectors to more than a dozen enterprise applications—Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Snowflake, Asana, Slack, Gong, HubSpot, Atlassian, Databricks, PitchBook, and FactSet—allowing the AI to retrieve information and take actions across those systems.Writer built these connectors using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI system integrations, but added what Shetrit described as an \"enterprise-ready\" layer on top.\"We took a first-principle approach of: You have this MCP connector infrastructure—how do you build it in a way that&#x27;s enterprise-ready?\" Shetrit explained. \"What we have today in the industry is definitely not it.\"The system can write and execute code on the fly to handle unexpected scenarios. If a user uploads an unfamiliar file format, for instance, the agent will generate code to extract and process the text without requiring a human to intervene.Jwo demonstrated this capability with a daily workflow she runs: Every morning at 10 a.m., a Routine automatically summarizes her Google Calendar meetings, identifies external participants, finds their LinkedIn profiles, and sends the summary to her via Slack — all without her involvement.\"This was pretty simple, but you can imagine for a salesperson it might say, &#x27;At the end of the day, wrap up a summary of all the calls I had, send me action items, post it to the account-specific Slack channel, and tag these folks so they can accomplish those workflows,&#x27;\" Jwo said. \"That can run continuously each day, each week, or on demand.\"From mortgage lenders to CPG brands: Real-world AI agent use cases across industriesThe platform is attracting customers across multiple industries. New American Funding, a mortgage lender, uses Writer Agent to automate marketing workflows. Senior Content Marketing Manager Karen Rodriguez uploads Asana project tickets with creative briefs, and the AI executes tasks like updating email campaigns or transforming articles into social media carousels, video scripts, and captions.Other use cases span financial services teams creating investment dashboards with PitchBook and FactSet data, consumer packaged goods companies brainstorming new product lines based on social media trends, and marketing teams generating partnership presentations with branded assets.Writer has added customers including TikTok, Comcast, Keurig Dr Pepper, CAA, and Aptitude Health, joining an existing base that includes Accenture, Qualcomm, Uber, Vanguard, and Marriott. The company now serves more than 300 enterprises and has secured over $50 million in signed contracts, with projections to double that to $100 million this year.The startup&#x27;s net retention rate — a measure of how much existing customers expand their usage — stands at 160%, meaning customers on average increase their spending by 60% after initial contracts. Twenty customers who started with $200,000-$300,000 contracts now spend about $1 million annually, according to company data.&#x27;Vibe working&#x27;: Writer&#x27;s vision for AI-powered productivity beyond codingWriter executives frame the platform as enabling what they call \"vibe working\" — a playful reference to the popular term \"vibe coding,\" which describes AI tools like Cursor that dramatically accelerate software development.\"We used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine. That&#x27;s optimizing the world as it is,\" Habib said at Writer&#x27;s AI Leaders Forum earlier this month, according to Forbes. \"We can now create a new world. That is the greenfield mindset.\"Shetrit echoed this framing: \"Vibe coding is the theme of 2025. Our view is that ‘vibe working’ is the theme of 2026. How do you bring the same productivity gains you&#x27;ve seen with coding agents into the workspace in a way that non-technical users can maximize them?\"The platform is powered by Palmyra X5, Writer&#x27;s proprietary large language model featuring a one-million-token context window — among the largest commercially available. Writer trained the model for approximately $700,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million OpenAI spent on GPT-4, by using synthetic data and techniques that halt training when returns diminish.The model can process one million tokens in about 22 seconds and costs 60 cents per million input tokens and $6 per million output tokens — significantly cheaper than comparable offerings, according to company specifications.Making AI Decisions Visible: Writer&#x27;s Approach to Trust and TransparencyA distinctive aspect of Writer&#x27;s approach is transparency into the AI&#x27;s decision-making process. The interface displays the agent&#x27;s step-by-step reasoning, showing which data sources it accessed, what code it generated, and how it arrived at outputs.\"There&#x27;s a very clear exhibition of how the agent is thinking, what it&#x27;s doing, what it&#x27;s touching,\" Shetrit said. \"This is important for the end user to trust it, but also important for the IT person or security professional to see what&#x27;s going on.\"This \"supervision\" model goes beyond simple observability of API calls to encompass what Shetrit described as \"a superset of observability\" — giving organizations the ability to not just monitor but control AI behavior through policies and permissions.Session logs capture all agent activity when enabled by administrators, and users can submit feedback on every output to help improve system performance. The platform also emphasizes providing sources and citations for generated content, allowing users to verify information.\"With any sort of chat assistant, agentic or not, trust but verify is really important,\" Jwo said. \"That&#x27;s part of the pillars of us building this and making it enterprise-grade.\"What Writer Agent Costs—and Why It&#x27;s Included in the Base PlatformWriter is including all the new capabilities—Playbooks, Routines, Connectors, and Personality customization—as part of its core platform without additional charges, according to Jwo.\"This is fully included as part of the Writer platform,\" she said. \"We&#x27;re not charging additional for using Writer Agent.\"The \"Personality\" feature allows individual users, teams, or entire organizations to customize the AI&#x27;s communication style, ensuring generated content matches brand voice and tone guidelines. This works alongside company-level controls that enforce terminology and style requirements.For highly structured, repetitive tasks, Writer also offers a library of more than 100 pre-built agents and an AI Studio for building custom multi-agent systems aligned with specific business use cases.The Race to Define Enterprise AI: Can Purpose-Built Platforms Beat Tech Giants?The launch crystallizes a fundamental tension in how enterprises will adopt AI at scale. While consumer-facing AI tools emphasize individual productivity gains, companies need systems that work reliably across thousands of employees, integrate with existing software infrastructure, maintain regulatory compliance, and deliver measurable business impact.Writer&#x27;s wager is that these requirements demand purpose-built enterprise platforms rather than consumer tools adapted for business use. The company&#x27;s $1.9 billion valuation — achieved in a November 2024 funding round that raised $200 million — suggests investors see merit in this thesis. Backers include Premji Invest, Radical Ventures, ICONIQ Growth, Salesforce Ventures, and Adobe Ventures.Yet the competitive landscape remains formidable. Microsoft and Google command enormous distribution advantages through their existing enterprise software relationships. OpenAI and Anthropic possess research capabilities that have produced breakthrough models. Whether Writer can maintain its differentiation as these giants expand their enterprise offerings will test the startup&#x27;s core premise: that serving Fortune 500 companies from day one creates advantages that research labs turned enterprise vendors cannot easily replicate.\"We&#x27;re entering an era where if you can describe a better way to work, you can build it,\" Jwo said. \"The new Writer Agent democratizes who gets to be a builder, empowering the operational experts and creative problem-solvers in every department to become the architects of their own transformation.

          "content": "Writer, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup, is launching a unified AI agent platform designed to let any employee automate complex business workflows without writing code — a capability the company says distinguishes it from consumer-oriented tools like Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT.The platform, called Writer Agent, combines chat-based assistance with autonomous task execution in a single interface. Starting Tuesday, enterprise customers can use natural language to instruct the AI to create presentations, analyze financial data, generate marketing campaigns, or coordinate across multiple business systems like Salesforce, Slack, and Google Workspace—then save those workflows as reusable \"Playbooks\" that run automatically on schedules.The announcement comes as enterprises struggle to move AI initiatives beyond pilot programs into production at scale. Writer CEO May Habib has been outspoken about this challenge, recently revealing that 42% of Fortune 500 executives surveyed by her company said AI is \"tearing their company apart\" due to coordination failures between departments.\"We&#x27;re delivering an agent interface that is both incredibly powerful and radically simple to transform individual productivity into organizational impact,\" Habib said in a statement. \"Writer Agent is the difference between a single sales rep asking a chatbot to write an outreach email and an enterprise ensuring that 1,000 reps are all sending on-brand, compliant, and contextually-aware messages to target accounts.\"How Writer is putting workflow automation in the hands of non-technical workersThe platform&#x27;s core innovation centers on making workflow automation accessible to non-technical employees—what Writer executives call \"democratizing who gets to be a builder.\"In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Doris Jwo, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, demonstrated how the system works: A user types a request in plain English — for example, \"Create a two-page partnership proposal between [Company A] and [Company B], make it a branded deck, include impact metrics and partnership tiers.\"The AI agent then breaks down that request into discrete steps, conducts web research, generates graphics and charts on the fly, creates individual slides with sourced information, and assembles a complete presentation. The entire process, which might take an employee hours or days, can be completed in 10-12 minutes.\"The agent basically looks at the request, breaks it down, does research, understands what pieces it needs, creates a detailed plan at a step-by-step level,\" Jwo explained during a product demonstration. \"It might say, &#x27;I need to do web research,&#x27; or &#x27;This user needs information from Gong or Slack,&#x27; and it reaches out to those connectors, grabs the data, and executes the plan.\"Crucially, users can save these multi-step processes as Playbooks—reusable templates that colleagues can deploy with a single click. Routines allow those Playbooks to run automatically at scheduled intervals, essentially putting knowledge work \"on autopilot.\"Security and compliance controls: Writer&#x27;s answer to enterprise IT concernsWriter positions these enterprise-focused controls as a key differentiator from competitors. While Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic offer powerful AI capabilities, Writer&#x27;s executives argue those tools weren&#x27;t designed from the ground up for the security, compliance, and governance requirements of large regulated organizations.\"All of the products you mentioned are great products, but even Copilot is very much focused on personal productivity—summarizing email, for example, which is important, but that&#x27;s not the component we&#x27;re focusing on,\" said Matan-Paul Shetrit, Writer&#x27;s director of product management, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.Shetrit emphasized Writer&#x27;s \"trust, security, and interoperability\" approach. IT administrators can granularly control what the AI can access — for instance, preventing market research agents from mentioning competitors, or restricting which employees can use web search capabilities. All activity is logged with detailed audit trails showing exactly what data the agent touched and what actions it took.\"These fine-grained controls are what make products enterprise-ready,\" Shetrit said. \"We can deploy to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of employees while maintaining the security and guardrails you need for that scale.\"This architecture reflects Writer&#x27;s origin story. Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic, which started as research labs and later added enterprise offerings, Writer has targeted Fortune 500 companies since its 2020 founding. \"We&#x27;re not a research lab that went to consumer and is dabbling in enterprise,\" Shetrit said. \"We are first and foremost targeting the Global 2000 and Fortune 500, and our research is in service of these customers&#x27; needs.\"Inside Writer&#x27;s strategy to connect AI agents across enterprise software systemsA critical technical component is Writer&#x27;s approach to system integrations. The platform includes pre-built connectors to more than a dozen enterprise applications—Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Snowflake, Asana, Slack, Gong, HubSpot, Atlassian, Databricks, PitchBook, and FactSet—allowing the AI to retrieve information and take actions across those systems.Writer built these connectors using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard for AI system integrations, but added what Shetrit described as an \"enterprise-ready\" layer on top.\"We took a first-principle approach of: You have this MCP connector infrastructure—how do you build it in a way that&#x27;s enterprise-ready?\" Shetrit explained. \"What we have today in the industry is definitely not it.\"The system can write and execute code on the fly to handle unexpected scenarios. If a user uploads an unfamiliar file format, for instance, the agent will generate code to extract and process the text without requiring a human to intervene.Jwo demonstrated this capability with a daily workflow she runs: Every morning at 10 a.m., a Routine automatically summarizes her Google Calendar meetings, identifies external participants, finds their LinkedIn profiles, and sends the summary to her via Slack — all without her involvement.\"This was pretty simple, but you can imagine for a salesperson it might say, &#x27;At the end of the day, wrap up a summary of all the calls I had, send me action items, post it to the account-specific Slack channel, and tag these folks so they can accomplish those workflows,&#x27;\" Jwo said. \"That can run continuously each day, each week, or on demand.\"From mortgage lenders to CPG brands: Real-world AI agent use cases across industriesThe platform is attracting customers across multiple industries. New American Funding, a mortgage lender, uses Writer Agent to automate marketing workflows. Senior Content Marketing Manager Karen Rodriguez uploads Asana project tickets with creative briefs, and the AI executes tasks like updating email campaigns or transforming articles into social media carousels, video scripts, and captions.Other use cases span financial services teams creating investment dashboards with PitchBook and FactSet data, consumer packaged goods companies brainstorming new product lines based on social media trends, and marketing teams generating partnership presentations with branded assets.Writer has added customers including TikTok, Comcast, Keurig Dr Pepper, CAA, and Aptitude Health, joining an existing base that includes Accenture, Qualcomm, Uber, Vanguard, and Marriott. The company now serves more than 300 enterprises and has secured over $50 million in signed contracts, with projections to double that to $100 million this year.The startup&#x27;s net retention rate — a measure of how much existing customers expand their usage — stands at 160%, meaning customers on average increase their spending by 60% after initial contracts. Twenty customers who started with $200,000-$300,000 contracts now spend about $1 million annually, according to company data.&#x27;Vibe working&#x27;: Writer&#x27;s vision for AI-powered productivity beyond codingWriter executives frame the platform as enabling what they call \"vibe working\" — a playful reference to the popular term \"vibe coding,\" which describes AI tools like Cursor that dramatically accelerate software development.\"We used to call it transformation when we took 12 steps and made them nine. That&#x27;s optimizing the world as it is,\" Habib said at Writer&#x27;s AI Leaders Forum earlier this month, according to Forbes. \"We can now create a new world. That is the greenfield mindset.\"Shetrit echoed this framing: \"Vibe coding is the theme of 2025. Our view is that ‘vibe working’ is the theme of 2026. How do you bring the same productivity gains you&#x27;ve seen with coding agents into the workspace in a way that non-technical users can maximize them?\"The platform is powered by Palmyra X5, Writer&#x27;s proprietary large language model featuring a one-million-token context window — among the largest commercially available. Writer trained the model for approximately $700,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million OpenAI spent on GPT-4, by using synthetic data and techniques that halt training when returns diminish.The model can process one million tokens in about 22 seconds and costs 60 cents per million input tokens and $6 per million output tokens — significantly cheaper than comparable offerings, according to company specifications.Making AI Decisions Visible: Writer&#x27;s Approach to Trust and TransparencyA distinctive aspect of Writer&#x27;s approach is transparency into the AI&#x27;s decision-making process. The interface displays the agent&#x27;s step-by-step reasoning, showing which data sources it accessed, what code it generated, and how it arrived at outputs.\"There&#x27;s a very clear exhibition of how the agent is thinking, what it&#x27;s doing, what it&#x27;s touching,\" Shetrit said. \"This is important for the end user to trust it, but also important for the IT person or security professional to see what&#x27;s going on.\"This \"supervision\" model goes beyond simple observability of API calls to encompass what Shetrit described as \"a superset of observability\" — giving organizations the ability to not just monitor but control AI behavior through policies and permissions.Session logs capture all agent activity when enabled by administrators, and users can submit feedback on every output to help improve system performance. The platform also emphasizes providing sources and citations for generated content, allowing users to verify information.\"With any sort of chat assistant, agentic or not, trust but verify is really important,\" Jwo said. \"That&#x27;s part of the pillars of us building this and making it enterprise-grade.\"What Writer Agent Costs—and Why It&#x27;s Included in the Base PlatformWriter is including all the new capabilities—Playbooks, Routines, Connectors, and Personality customization—as part of its core platform without additional charges, according to Jwo.\"This is fully included as part of the Writer platform,\" she said. \"We&#x27;re not charging additional for using Writer Agent.\"The \"Personality\" feature allows individual users, teams, or entire organizations to customize the AI&#x27;s communication style, ensuring generated content matches brand voice and tone guidelines. This works alongside company-level controls that enforce terminology and style requirements.For highly structured, repetitive tasks, Writer also offers a library of more than 100 pre-built agents and an AI Studio for building custom multi-agent systems aligned with specific business use cases.The Race to Define Enterprise AI: Can Purpose-Built Platforms Beat Tech Giants?The launch crystallizes a fundamental tension in how enterprises will adopt AI at scale. While consumer-facing AI tools emphasize individual productivity gains, companies need systems that work reliably across thousands of employees, integrate with existing software infrastructure, maintain regulatory compliance, and deliver measurable business impact.Writer&#x27;s wager is that these requirements demand purpose-built enterprise platforms rather than consumer tools adapted for business use. The company&#x27;s $1.9 billion valuation — achieved in a November 2024 funding round that raised $200 million — suggests investors see merit in this thesis. Backers include Premji Invest, Radical Ventures, ICONIQ Growth, Salesforce Ventures, and Adobe Ventures.Yet the competitive landscape remains formidable. Microsoft and Google command enormous distribution advantages through their existing enterprise software relationships. OpenAI and Anthropic possess research capabilities that have produced breakthrough models. Whether Writer can maintain its differentiation as these giants expand their enterprise offerings will test the startup&#x27;s core premise: that serving Fortune 500 companies from day one creates advantages that research labs turned enterprise vendors cannot easily replicate.\"We&#x27;re entering an era where if you can describe a better way to work, you can build it,\" Jwo said. \"The new Writer Agent democratizes who gets to be a builder, empowering the operational experts and creative problem-solvers in every department to become the architects of their own transformation. That&#x27;s how you unlock innovation that competitors can&#x27;t replicate.\"The promise is alluring — AI capabilities powerful enough to transform how work gets done, accessible enough for any employee to use, and controlled enough for enterprises to deploy safely at scale. Whether Writer can deliver on that promise at the speed and scale required will determine if its vision of \"vibe working\" becomes the 2026 theme Shetrit predicts, or just another ambitious attempt to solve enterprise AI&#x27;s execution problem.But one thing is certain: In a market where 85% of AI initiatives fail to escape pilot purgatory, Writer is betting that the winners won&#x27;t be the companies with the most powerful models—they&#x27;ll be the ones that make those models actually work inside the enterprise.",

          "title": "Microsoft remakes Windows for an era of autonomous AI agents",
          "standfirst": "Microsoft is fundamentally restructuring its Windows operating system to become what executives call the first \"agentic OS,\" embedding the infrastructure needed for autonomous AI agents to operate securely at enterprise scale — a watershed moment in the evolution of personal computing that positions the 40-year-old platform as the foundation for a new era of human-machine collaboration.The company announced Tuesday at its Ignite conference that it is introducing native agent infrastructure directly into Windows 11, allowing AI agents — autonomous software programs that can perform complex, multi-step tasks on behalf of users — to discover tools, execute workflows, and interact with applications through standardized protocols while operating in secure, policy-controlled environments separate from user sessions.The shift is Microsoft&#x27;s most significant architectural evolution of Windows since the introduction of the modern security model, transforming the operating system from a platform where users manually orchestrate applications into one where they can \"simply express your desired outcome, and agents handle the complexity,\" according to Pavan Davuluri, President of Windows & Devices at Microsoft.\"Windows 11 starts with this notion of secure by design, secure by default,\" Davuluri said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"And a lot of the work that we&#x27;re doing today, when we think about the engagement we have with our customers, the expectations they have with us is making sure we are building upon the fact that Windows is the most secure platform for them and is the most resilient platform as well.\"The announcements arrive as enterprises are experimenting with AI agents but struggling with fragmented tooling, security concerns, and lack of centralized management — challenges that Microsoft believes only operating system-level integration can solve. The stakes are enormous: with Windows running on an estimated 1.4 billion devices globally, Microsoft&#x27;s architectural choices will likely shape how organizations deploy autonomous AI systems for years to come.New platform primitives create foundation for agent computingAt the core of Microsoft&#x27;s vision are three new platform capabilities entering preview that fundamentally change how agents operate on Windows. Agent Connectors provide native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard introduced by Anthropic that allows AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources. Microsoft has built what it calls an \"on-device registry\" — a secure, manageable repository where developers can register their applications&#x27; capabilities as agent connectors, making them discoverable to any compatible agent on the system.\"These are platform capabilities that then become available to all of our customers,\" Davuluri explained, describing how the Windows file system, for example, becomes an agent connector that any MCP-compatible agent can access with user consent. \"We&#x27;re able to do this in a fashion that can scale for one but it also allows others to participate in the Windows registry for MCP.\"The architecture introduces an MCP proxy layer that handles authentication, authorization, and auditing for all communication between agents and connectors. Microsoft is launching with two built-in agent connectors for File Explorer and System Settings, allowing agents to manage files or adjust system configurations like switching between light and dark mode — all with explicit user permission.Agent Workspace, entering private preview, represents perhaps the most significant security innovation. It creates what Microsoft describes as \"a contained, policy-controlled, and auditable environment where agents can interact with software\" — essentially a parallel desktop session where agents operate with their own distinct identity, completely separate from the user&#x27;s primary session.\"We want to be able to have clarity in the identity of the agent that is operating in the local operating system,\" Davuluri said, addressing security concerns about agents accessing sensitive data. \"We want that session to be a session that is secure, that is policy control, that is manageable, that has transparency and auditability.\"Each agent workspace runs with minimal privileges by default, accessing only explicitly granted resources. The system maintains detailed audit logs distinguishing agent actions from user actions — critical for enterprises that need to prove compliance and track all changes to systems and data.Windows 365 for Agents extends this infrastructure to the cloud, turning Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud PC offering into execution environments for agents. Instead of running on local devices, agents can operate in secure, policy-controlled virtual machines in Azure, enabling what Microsoft calls \"computer-using agents\" to interact with legacy applications and perform automation tasks at scale without consuming local compute resources.Taskbar becomes command center for monitoring AI agents at workThe infrastructure enables significant user interface changes designed to make agents as commonplace as applications. Microsoft is introducing \"Ask Copilot on the taskbar,\" a unified entry point in preview that combines Microsoft 365 Copilot, agent invocation, and traditional search in a single interface.Users will be able to invoke agents using \"@\" mentions directly from the taskbar, then monitor their progress through familiar UI patterns like hover cards, progress badges, and notifications — all while continuing other work. When an agent completes a task or needs input, it surfaces updates through the taskbar without disrupting the user&#x27;s primary workflow.\"We&#x27;ve evolved and created new UX in the taskbar to reflect the unique needs of agents performing background tasks on your behalf,\" said Navjot Virk, Corporate Vice President of Windows Experiences, describing features like progress bars and status badges that indicate when agents are working, need approval, or have completed tasks.The design philosophy, Virk emphasized, centers on user control. \"These experiences are designed to be opt in. We want to give customers full control over when and how they engage with copilots and agents.\"For commercial Microsoft 365 Copilot users, the integration goes deeper. Microsoft is embedding Copilot directly into File Explorer, allowing users to ask questions, generate summaries, or draft emails based on document contents without leaving the file management interface. On Copilot+ PCs — devices with neural processing units capable of 40 trillion operations per second — new capabilities include converting any on-screen table into an Excel spreadsheet through the Click to Do feature.Microsoft bets on open standards against Apple and Google&#x27;s proprietary approachesMicrosoft&#x27;s embrace of the open Model Context Protocol, created by Anthropic, marks a strategic bet on openness as enterprises evaluate competing AI platforms from Apple and Google that use proprietary frameworks.\"Windows is an open platform, and by virtue [of being] an open platform, we certainly have the ability to take existing technologies, evolve, harden, adapt those, but we also allow customers to bring their own capabilities to the platform as well,\" Davuluri said when asked about competing with Apple Intelligence and Google&#x27;s Android AI for Enterprise.The company demonstrated this openness with Claude, Anthropic&#x27;s AI assistant, accessing the Windows file system through agent connectors with user consent — one of numerous partnerships Microsoft has secured. Dynamics 365 is using the File Explorer connector to streamline expense reporting, reducing what was previously a 30-minute, dozen-step process to \"one sentence with high accuracy,\" according to Microsoft&#x27;s blog post. Other early partners include Manus AI, Dropbox Dash, Roboflow, and Infosys.\"Windows is the platform in which they build upon,\" Davuluri said of enterprise customers. \"And so our ability to take those existing bodies of work they have, and extend them is the, I think, the least friction way for them to go, learn, adopt, experiment and find ways to [scale].\"Security model enforces strict containment and mandatory user consentMicrosoft&#x27;s security model for agents adheres to what it calls \"secure by default\" policies aligned with the company&#x27;s broader Secure Future Initiative. All agent connectors registered in the on-device registry must meet strict requirements around packaging and identity, with applications properly packaged and signed by trusted sources. Developers must explicitly declare the minimum capabilities their agent connectors require, and agents and connectors run in isolated environments with dedicated agent user accounts, separate from human user accounts. Windows requires explicit user approval when agents first access sensitive resources like files or system settings.\"We give Windows the ability to go deliver on the security expectations, and then it is auditable at the end of the day,\" Davuluri said. \"You still want an auditability log that looks similar to perhaps what you use in the cloud. And so all three pieces are built into the design and architecture of Agent Workspace.\"For IT administrators, Microsoft is introducing management policies through Intune and Group Policy that allow organizations to enable or disable agent features at device and account levels, set minimum security policy levels, and access event logs enumerating all agent connector invocations and errors. The company emphasized that agents operate with restricted privileges, with minimal permissions by default and access granted only to explicitly approved resources that users can revoke at any time. Post-quantum cryptography and recovery tools address emerging and persistent threatsBeyond agent infrastructure, Microsoft announced significant security and resilience updates addressing both emerging and persistent enterprise challenges. Post-Quantum Cryptography APIs are now generally available in Windows, allowing organizations to begin migrating to encryption algorithms designed to withstand future quantum computing attacks that could break today&#x27;s cryptographic standards. Microsoft worked closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement these algorithms.\"We are introducing post quantum cryptography APIs in Windows,\" Davuluri said. \"For customers who want to be able to do cryptographic encryption in their workloads, they can start taking advantage of these APIs in Windows for the first time. That is a huge step forward for us when we think about the future of windows.\"Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will arrive on new devices starting spring 2026, offloading disk encryption to dedicated silicon for faster performance while providing hardware-level key protection. Sysmon functionality is becoming generally available as part of Windows in early 2026, bringing advanced forensics and threat detection capabilities previously available only as a separate download directly into the operating system&#x27;s event logging system.The company also detailed progress on its Windows Resiliency Initiative, launched a year ago following the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted 8.5 million Windows devices globally. New recovery capabilities include Quick Machine Recovery with expanded networking support and Autopatch management, allowing IT to remotely fix devices stuck in Windows Recovery Environment. Point-in-time restore entering preview rolls back devices to earlier states to resolve update conflicts or configuration errors, while Cloud rebuild in preview allows IT to remotely rebuild malfunctioning devices by downloading fresh installation media and using Autopilot for zero-touch provisioning.Microsoft is also raising security requirements for third-party drivers across the Windows ecosystem. Following updated requirements for antivirus drivers effective April 1, 2025, the company is expanding this approach to other driver classes including networking, cameras, USB, printers, and storage — requiring higher certification standards, adding compiler safeguards, and providing more Windows in-box drivers to reduce reliance on third-party kernel-mode code.Measured rollout reflects enterprise caution around autonomous softwareMicrosoft is positioning these updates as essential infrastructure for what it calls \"Frontier Firms\" — organizations that \"blend human ingenuity with intelligent systems to deliver real outcomes.\" However, the company emphasized a cautious, opt-in approach that reflects enterprise concerns about autonomous software agents.\"The principles we&#x27;re using in designing these new platform capabilities accounts for the reality that we have a very, very broad user base,\" Davuluri said. \"A lot of the features and capabilities we&#x27;re building are opt in capabilities. And so it is our goal to be able to have users find value in the workflow and meet them.\"Virk emphasized the measured approach: \"This is more about meeting customers where they are and then taking them on this journey when they are ready. So there&#x27;s the optionality, but also having support for it. And really important thing is that they should feel comfortable. They should feel secure.\"Microsoft&#x27;s bet is that only operating system-level integration can provide the security, governance, and user experience required for mainstream AI agent adoption. Whether that vision materializes will depend on developer adoption, enterprise comfort with autonomous software, and Microsoft&#x27;s ability to balance innovation with the stability that 40 years of Windows customers expect. After four decades of putting users in control of their computers, Windows is now asking them to share that control with machines.",

Post-quantum cryptography and recovery tools address emerging and persistent threatsBeyond agent infrastructure, Microsoft announced significant security and resilience updates addressing both emerging and persistent enterprise challenges. Post-Quantum Cryptography APIs are now generally available in Windows, allowing organizations to begin migrating to encryption algorithms designed to withstand future quantum computing attacks that could break today&#x27;s cryptographic standards. Microsoft worked closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement these algorithms.\"We are introducing post quantum cryptography APIs in Windows,\" Davuluri said. \"For customers who want to be able to do cryptographic encryption in their workloads, they can start taking advantage of these APIs in Windows for the first time. That is a huge step forward for us when we think about the future of windows.\"Hardware-accelerated BitLocker will arrive on new devices starting spring 2026, offloading disk encryption to dedicated silicon for faster performance while providing hardware-level key protection. Sysmon functionality is becoming generally available as part of Windows in early 2026, bringing advanced forensics and threat detection capabilities previously available only as a separate download directly into the operating system&#x27;s event logging system.The company also detailed progress on its Windows Resiliency Initiative, launched a year ago following the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted 8.5 million Windows devices globally. New recovery capabilities include Quick Machine Recovery with expanded networking support and Autopatch management, allowing IT to remotely fix devices stuck in Windows Recovery Environment. Point-in-time restore entering preview rolls back devices to earlier states to resolve update conflicts or configuration errors, while Cloud rebuild in preview allows IT to remotely rebuild malfunctioning devices by downloading fresh installation media and using Autopilot for zero-touch provisioning.Microsoft is also raising security requirements for third-party drivers across the Windows ecosystem. Following updated requirements for antivirus drivers effective April 1, 2025, the company is expanding this approach to other driver classes including networking, cameras, USB, printers, and storage — requiring higher certification standards, adding compiler safeguards, and providing more Windows in-box drivers to reduce reliance on third-party kernel-mode code.Measured rollout reflects enterprise caution around autonomous softwareMicrosoft is positioning these updates as essential infrastructure for what it calls \"Frontier Firms\" — organizations that \"blend human ingenuity with intelligent systems to deliver real outcomes.\" However, the company emphasized a cautious, opt-in approach that reflects enterprise concerns about autonomous software agents.\"The principles we&#x27;re using in designing these new platform capabilities accounts for the reality that we have a very, very broad user base,\" Davuluri said. \"A lot of the features and capabilities we&#x27;re building are opt in capabilities. And so it is our goal to be able to have users find value in the workflow and meet them.\"Virk emphasized the measured approach: \"This is more about meeting customers where they are and then taking them on this journey when they are ready. So there&#x27;s the optionality, but also having support for it. And really important thing is that they should feel comfortable. They should feel secure.\"Microsoft&#x27;s bet is that only operating system-level integration can provide the security, governance, and user experience required for mainstream AI agent adoption. Whether that vision materializes will depend on developer adoption, enterprise comfort with autonomous software, and Microsoft&#x27;s ability to balance innovation with the stability that 40 years of Windows customers expect. After four decades of putting users in control of their computers, Windows is now asking them to share that control with machines.",

          "content": "It’s no surprise that the Porsche Cayenne EV is a beast. Of course the famed German automaker would tout its all-electric SUV as “the most powerful,” the quickest — both off the line and in a charging stall — and record-setting in so many ways. The question remains: how beastly are we talking? Now, thankfully, the Cayenne Electric is coming more into focus. Today, the new Cayenne is officially joining the existing lineup of gas and hybrid Caynne powertrains to round out what the automaker is calling “a new era for Porsche.” It makes sense that Porsche would be trying to turn a new page. After all, this is an automaker long touted as the epitome of German engineering prowess that presently finds itself mired in a crisis. US tariffs, plus an unrelenting price war in China, has fueled steep losses at Porsche, including a $1.1 billion operating loss in the third quarter alone. And EV sales, especially in the luxury segment, are looking increasingly fraught in the current environment. Can the Cayenne Electric help turn things around? The specs alone certainly suggest a paradigm shift may be under way: up to 850kW (1,139hp) of power, 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds, a top speed of 162mph and, under ideal conditions, up to 400kW charging power, for a 10-80 percent state of charge in just 18 minutes. The Cayenne Electric will be the first electric Porsche to support inductive charging. When parked above a floor plate, the EV can charge at speeds of up to 11kW. At launch, the electric SUV will come in two variants: Cayenne Electric, starting at $111,350 (including destination charge); and the $165,350 Cayenne Turbo Electric. Clearly, these are not the affordable EVs that we were promised, nor do they pretend to be. After all, it’s Porsche. As such, there’s a lot of go-fast ingenuity built into the Cayenne Electric. In addition to an output of 1,139hp, the dual-motor SUV is capable of 1,106lb-ft of torque when Launch Control is activated. In normal driving mode, up to 630kW (844hp) is available. And with a Push-to-Pass function, an additional 130kW (173hp) can be activated for 10 seconds at the push of a button. The standard model has 300kW (402hp) in normal operation and 325kW (435hp) and 615lb-ft of torque in Launch Control. This version can gallop from 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds with a top track speed of 143mph. But the Cayenne Electric won’t just be a beast on the track. Porsche is also claiming that the new SUV will be able to tow up to 3.5 tons, or 7,716lbs — when properly equipped. The automaker has been teasing this insane capability for a while now, but it still bears repeating: 3.5 tons. That’s more than a Toyota Tacoma. The automaker is making a lot of hay of its traction control and suspension system. The Cayenne Electric will be the first SUV to get Active Ride, the hydraulic suspension system found on the Taycan and Panamera. The adaptive air suspension is fitted as standard on both models. And the Turbo trim features Porsche’s torque vectoring limited-slip rear differential. Thanks to the 800-volt architecture, the Cayenne Electric’s 113kWh battery pack can be replenished at speeds up to 400kW (if you can find a charger that meets that specification). The Cayenne Electric will come equipped with a Tesla Supercharger/NACS fast-charging port on the driver-side rear fender, and a CCS/AC-only charging port on the passenger-side rear fender. Most Cayenne owners will likely charge at home, and for that, Porsche has a new inductive charging pad for those that prefer to do their charging wirelessly. The charging pad made its debut at IAA Mobility in Munich earlier this year, though Porsche has yet to announce a price. Once the electric Cayenne is parked in the correct position over a plate on the ground, it can accept a charge from another plate underneath its body. We’ve already covered the Cayenne Electric’s unique interior design. Yes, I’m talking about the bending screen. Porsche calls it the Flow Display, a vertically installed screen that curves toward the bottom. It’s the largest screen ever to be featured in a Porsche and it will run on Porsche’s all new operating system, which the automaker claims will “flow” harmoniously throughout the vehicle’s interior. Porsche didn’t provide measurements for the Flow Display, but it said that it would be bookended by a 14.25-inch OLED instrument cluster and a 14.9-inch optional passenger display. Considering Porsche is on tap to receive Apple’s newly immersive CarPlay Ultra, one wonders how phone mirroring will work with this massive curved display. There will also be a heads-up display that simulates an “87-inch display area 10 meters in front of the vehicle.” But before you go complaining about an overreliance on digital controls, Porsche says that frequently used functions, such as HVAC and volume control, are analog. And a hand rest called the “Ferry pad” has been developed to help the driver operate digital and analog controls ergonomically. Porsche claims the new Cayenne prioritizes driver engagement with a new AI-powered voice assistant, which can “reliably” understand complex instructions and spontaneous follow-up questions without repeating the activation word. The voice assistant controls climate, seat heating, and ambient lighting, while also recognizing addresses, points of interest, and traffic information. The Cayenne Electric and Turbo Electric are available to order now, with customer deliveries expected in summer 2026. Photography: Porsche",

True understanding The reason computers fared poorly in math competitions is that, while they far surpass humanity’s ability to perform calculations, they are not really that good at the logic and reasoning that is needed for advanced math. Put differently, they are good at performing calculations really quickly, but they usually suck at understanding why they’re doing them. While something like addition seems simple, humans can do semi-formal proofs based on definitions of addition or go for fully formal Peano arithmetic that defines the properties of natural numbers and operations like addition through axioms.Read full article Comments",

Heineman’s GoFundMe page, which displayed a final message she had posted about entering palliative care, will now help her family with funeral costs. Rebecca “Burger Becky” Heineman was born in October 1963 and grew up in Whittier, California. She first gained national recognition in 1980 when she won the national Atari 2600 Space Invaders championship in New York at age 16, becoming the first formally recognized US video game champion. That victory launched a career spanning more than four decades and 67 credited games, according to MobyGames. Among many achievements in her life, Heineman was perhaps best known for co-founding Interplay Productions with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell in 1983. The company created franchises like Wasteland, Fallout, and Baldur’s Gate. At Interplay, Heineman designed The Bard’s Tale III: Thief of Fate and Dragon Wars while also programming ports of classics like Wolfenstein 3D and Battle Chess.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "On a sunny morning on October 19 2025, four men allegedly walked into the world’s most-visited museum and left, minutes later, with crown jewels worth 88 million euros ($101 million). The theft from Paris’ Louvre Museum—one of the world’s most surveilled cultural institutions—took just under eight minutes. Visitors kept browsing. Security didn’t react (until alarms were triggered). The men disappeared into the city’s traffic before anyone realized what had happened. Investigators later revealed that the thieves wore hi-vis vests, disguising themselves as construction workers. They arrived with a furniture lift, a common sight in Paris’s narrow streets, and used it to reach a balcony overlooking the Seine. Dressed as workers, they looked as if they belonged. This strategy worked because we don’t see the world objectively. We see it through categories—through what we expect to see. The thieves understood the social categories that we perceive as “normal” and exploited them to avoid suspicion. Many artificial intelligence (AI) systems work in the same way and are vulnerable to the same kinds of mistakes as a result. The sociologist Erving Goffman would describe what happened at the Louvre using his concept of the presentation of self: people “perform” social roles by adopting the cues others expect. Here, the performance of normality became the perfect camouflage. The sociology of sight Humans carry out mental categorization all the time to make sense of people and places. When something fits the category of “ordinary,” it slips from notice. AI systems used for tasks such as facial recognition and detecting suspicious activity in a public area operate in a similar way. For humans, categorization is cultural. For AI, it is mathematical. But both systems rely on learned patterns rather than objective reality. Because AI learns from data about who looks “normal” and who looks “suspicious,” it absorbs the categories embedded in its training data. And this makes it susceptible to bias. The Louvre robbers weren’t seen as dangerous because they fit a trusted category. In AI, the same process can have the opposite effect: people who don’t fit the statistical norm become more visible and over-scrutinized. It can mean a facial recognition system disproportionately flags certain racial or gendered groups as potential threats while letting others pass unnoticed. A sociological lens helps us see that these aren’t separate issues. AI doesn’t invent its categories; it learns ours. When a computer vision system is trained on security footage where “normal” is defined by particular bodies, clothing, or behavior, it reproduces those assumptions. Just as the museum’s guards looked past the thieves because they appeared to belong, AI can look past certain patterns while overreacting to others. Categorization, whether human or algorithmic, is a double-edged sword. It helps us process information quickly, but it also encodes our cultural assumptions. Both people and machines rely on pattern recognition, which is an efficient but imperfect strategy. A sociological view of AI treats algorithms as mirrors: They reflect back our social categories and hierarchies. In the Louvre case, the mirror is turned toward us. The robbers succeeded not because they were invisible, but because they were seen through the lens of normality. In AI terms, they passed the classification test. From museum halls to machine learning This link between perception and categorization reveals something important about our increasingly algorithmic world. Whether it’s a guard deciding who looks suspicious or an AI deciding who looks like a “shoplifter,” the underlying process is the same: assigning people to categories based on cues that feel objective but are culturally learned. When an AI system is described as “biased,” this often means that it reflects those social categories too faithfully. The Louvre heist reminds us that these categories don’t just shape our attitudes, they shape what gets noticed at all. After the theft, France’s culture minister promised new cameras and tighter security. But no matter how advanced those systems become, they will still rely on categorization. Someone, or something, must decide what counts as “suspicious behavior.” If that decision rests on assumptions, the same blind spots will persist. The Louvre robbery will be remembered as one of Europe’s most spectacular museum thefts. The thieves succeeded because they mastered the sociology of appearance: They understood the categories of normality and used them as tools. And in doing so, they showed how both people and machines can mistake conformity for safety. Their success in broad daylight wasn’t only a triumph of planning. It was a triumph of categorical thinking, the same logic that underlies both human perception and artificial intelligence. The lesson is clear: Before we teach machines to see better, we must first learn to question how we see.

Out in the Middle East, the autonomous A2RL crew held another race at Yas Marina, one that by all accounts was a lot more impressive than the last time the self-driving race cars competed against a human. Formula E teams are getting ready for the debut next year of their Gen4 era, which sees cars with real downforce and almost twice as much power. Meanwhile, we only have a few months left before we see the results of F1’s new technical rules change, as the sport adopts far more powerful electrical propulsion and active aerodynamics. But what if there was an electric single-seater that was faster around a track than any of these? That’s the idea behind the DRG-Lola, a racing concept designed from the ground up by Lola Cars, the storied-now-reborn British race car manufacturer, and Lucas di Grassi, veteran of the hybrid LMP1 sportscar days and FIA Formula E champion. Di Grassi is one of the more thoughtful racing drivers out there and is a passionate advocate of clean technologies in racing—in 2020 he shared his earlier thoughts on where Formula E could take its technical direction. The DRG-Lola is much closer to reality than that 2020 concept; di Grassi has relied on existing battery and motor technology, rather than some uninvented unobtanium to make it all work. It generates 804 hp (600 kW) from a pair of electric motors driving the front and rear axles and is powered by a 60 kWh battery pack that’s arranged in modules on either side of the driver’s cockpit.Read full article Comments",

The OnePlus 15 still doesn’t deliver the most satisfying software experience, and the camera may actually be a step back for the company, but the things OnePlus gets right are very right. It’s a fast, sleek phone that runs for ages on a charge, and it’s a little cheaper than the competition. But its shortcomings make it hard to recommend this device over the latest from Google or Samsung—or even the flagship phone OnePlus released 10 months ago. US buyers have time to mull it over, though. Because of the recent government shutdown, Federal Communications Commission approval of the OnePlus 15 has been delayed.

The DoorDasher was a 23-year-old woman named Olivia Henderson, and she felt like the whole situation was some kind of creepy exploitation play. Was this guy purposely exposing himself to her? Was he even asleep? Should she have to endure the sight of random male genitalia just to make a few bucks? She did not think so, and she decided to do something about it.

The Times obtained a recording of a call during which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to state health departments that the ongoing measles outbreak at the border of Arizona and Utah is a continuation of the explosive outbreak in West Texas that began in mid- to late-January. That is, the two massive outbreaks are being caused by the same subtype of measles virus. This is a significant link that hasn’t previously been reported despite persistent questions from journalists and concerns from health experts, particularly in light of Canada losing its elimination status last week. The loss of an elimination status means that measles will once again be considered endemic to the US, an embarrassing public health backslide for a vaccine-preventable disease.Read full article Comments",

A new build of Windows 11 released to Windows Insider Program testers yesterday includes a new “experimental agentic features” toggle in the Settings to support a feature called Copilot Actions, and Microsoft has published a detailed support article detailing more about just how those “experimental agentic features” will work. If you’re not familiar, “agentic” is a buzzword that Microsoft has used repeatedly to describe its future ambitions for Windows 11—in plainer language, these agents are meant to accomplish assigned tasks in the background, allowing the user’s attention to be turned elsewhere. Microsoft says it wants agents to be capable of “everyday tasks like organizing files, scheduling meetings, or sending emails,” and that Copilot Actions should give you “an active digital collaborator that can carry out complex tasks for you to enhance efficiency and productivity.” But like other kinds of AI, these agents can be prone to error and confabulations and will often proceed as if they know what they’re doing even when they don’t. They also present, in Microsoft’s own words, “novel security risks,” mostly related to what can happen if an attacker is able to give instructions to one of these agents. As a result, Microsoft’s implementation walks a tightrope between giving these agents access to your files and cordoning them off from the rest of the system.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "If you’ve ever tried to hook an old Nintendo 64 up to a modern HDTV, you know the results can be less than ideal. Assuming your original hardware still works and your flatscreen even has the requisite R/F and/or composite inputs to allow for the connection, the N64’s output will probably look like a blurry mess on a flatscreen that wasn’t designed with those old video signals as a priority. The Analogue 3D solves this very specific problem very well, with a powerful FPGA core that accurately replicates a Nintendo 64 and well-made display filters that do a good job of approximating that cathode-ray tube glow you remember from decades ago. But the lack of easy expandability limits the appeal of this $250 device to all but the most die-hard fans of original N64 hardware. A beauty to behold As a piece of physical design, the Analogue 3D is a work of art. The gentle curves of its sleek black shell evoke the original N64 design without copying it, coming in at a slightly smaller footprint and height. Plus, there’s no ugly power brick.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The big holiday releases are still waiting in the wings, but it’s not too soon to look forward to what’s coming in 2026. Amazon MGM Studios has released a new trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, which is based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. Weir told The New York Times that the inspiration for his novel came from a planned multi-book space opera called Zhek that he began writing after The Martian, about a potential fuel for interstellar travel. He eventually abandoned that effort and wrote the 2017 novel, Artemis, instead, but aspects of Zhek found their way into the Project Hail Mary novel. As we’ve previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star.

That’s now changing as he takes on the role of co-CEO of a new AI company, according to a New York Times report citing three people familiar with the company. Grandiosely named Project Prometheus (and not to be confused with the NASA project of the same name), the company will focus on using AI to pursue breakthroughs in research, engineering, manufacturing, and other fields that are dubbed part of “the physical economy”—in contrast to the software applications that are likely the first thing most people in the general public think of when they hear “AI.” Bezos’ co-CEO will be Vik Bajaj, a chemist and physicist who previously led life sciences work at Google X, an Alphabet-backed research group that worked on speculative projects that could lead to more product categories. (For example, it developed technologies that would later underpin Google’s Waymo service.) Bajaj also worked at Verily, another Alphabet-backed research group focused on life sciences, and Foresite Labs, an incubator for new AI companies.Read full article Comments",

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person.Read full article Comments",

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says there’s not much his Optimus robots won’t be able to do in the future—following people around to prevent them from committing crimes is the latest—despite the technology not quite existing yet. Musk’s robotaxis are a little closer to reality, with a kind of limited service being offered in Austin, Texas, as well as parts of San Francisco. But Tesla might need to rethink its approach to safety drivers after a Tesla rideshare passenger in San Francisco took to Reddit to share a video of the operator asleep in the driver’s seat. In fact, the safety driver fell asleep three times during the ride, which took place a little over a week ago, according to Reddit user ohmichael. In his post, which contains a 12-second clip of a man sleeping and then waking in the front seat of a moving Tesla, the poster says he contacted Tesla to report this behavior but never heard back.Read full article Comments",

The study, led by researchers at Harvard, fills a knowledge gap of how the Trump administration’s research funding cuts affected clinical trials specifically. It makes clear not just the wastefulness and inefficiency of the cuts but also the deep ethical violations, JAMA Internal Medicine editors wrote in an accompanying editor’s note. In March, the National Institutes of Health, under the control of the Trump administration, announced that it would cancel $1.8 billion in grant funding that wasn’t aligned with the administration’s priorities. The Harvard researchers, led by health care policy expert Anupam Jena, used an NIH database and a federal accountability tracking tool to find grants supporting clinical trials that were active as of February 28 but had been terminated by August 15.Read full article Comments",
