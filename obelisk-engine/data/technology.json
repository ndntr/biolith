          "standfirst": "Our LLM API bill was growing 30% month-over-month. Traffic was increasing, but not that fast. When I analyzed our query logs, I found the real problem: Users ask the same questions in different ways.\"What&#x27;s your return policy?,\" \"How do I return something?\", and \"Can I get a refund?\" were all hitting our LLM separately, generating nearly identical responses, each incurring full API costs.Exact-match caching, the obvious first solution, captured only 18% of these redundant calls. The same semantic question, phrased differently, bypassed the cache entirely.So, I implemented semantic caching based on what queries mean, not how they&#x27;re worded. After implementing it, our cache hit rate increased to 67%, reducing LLM API costs by 73%. But getting there requires solving problems that naive implementations miss.Why exact-match caching falls shortTraditional caching uses query text as the cache key. This works when queries are identical:# Exact-match cachingcache_key = hash(query_text)if cache_key in cache: return cache[cache_key]But users don&#x27;t phrase questions identically. My analysis of 100,000 production queries found:Only 18% were exact duplicates of previous queries47% were semantically similar to previous queries (same intent, different wording)35% were genuinely novel queriesThat 47% represented massive cost savings we were missing. Each semantically-similar query triggered a full LLM call, generating a response nearly identical to one we&#x27;d already computed.Semantic caching architectureSemantic caching replaces text-based keys with embedding-based similarity lookup:class SemanticCache: def __init__(self, embedding_model, similarity_threshold=0.92): self.embedding_model = embedding_model self.threshold = similarity_threshold self.vector_store = VectorStore() # FAISS, Pinecone, etc. self.response_store = ResponseStore() # Redis, DynamoDB, etc. def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\"Return cached response if semantically similar query exists.\"\"\" query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) # Find most similar cached query matches = self.vector_store.search(query_embedding, top_k=1) if matches and matches[0].similarity >= self.threshold: cache_id = matches[0].id return self.response_store.get(cache_id) return None def set(self, query: str, response: str): \"\"\"Cache query-response pair.\"\"\" query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) cache_id = generate_id() self.vector_store.add(cache_id, query_embedding) self.response_store.set(cache_id, { &#x27;query&#x27;: query, &#x27;response&#x27;: response, &#x27;timestamp&#x27;: datetime.utcnow() })The key insight: Instead of hashing query text, I embed queries into vector space and find cached queries within a similarity threshold.The threshold problemThe similarity threshold is the critical parameter. Set it too high, and you miss valid cache hits. Set it too low, and you return wrong responses.Our initial threshold of 0.85 seemed reasonable; 85% similar should be \"the same question,\" right?Wrong. At 0.85, we got cache hits like:Query: \"How do I cancel my subscription?\"Cached: \"How do I cancel my order?\"Similarity: 0.87These are different questions with different answers. Returning the cached response would be incorrect.I discovered that optimal thresholds vary by query type:Query typeOptimal thresholdRationaleFAQ-style questions0.94High precision needed; wrong answers damage trustProduct searches0.88More tolerance for near-matchesSupport queries0.92Balance between coverage and accuracyTransactional queries0.97Very low tolerance for errorsI implemented query-type-specific thresholds:class AdaptiveSemanticCache: def __init__(self): self.thresholds = { &#x27;faq&#x27;: 0.94, &#x27;search&#x27;: 0.88, &#x27;support&#x27;: 0.92, &#x27;transactional&#x27;: 0.97, &#x27;default&#x27;: 0.92 } self.query_classifier = QueryClassifier() def get_threshold(self, query: str) -> float: query_type = self.query_classifier.classify(query) return self.thresholds.get(query_type, self.thresholds[&#x27;default&#x27;]) def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]: threshold = self.get_threshold(query) query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) matches = self.vector_store.search(query_embedding, top_k=1) if matches and matches[0].similarity >= threshold: return self.response_store.get(matches[0].id) return NoneThreshold tuning methodologyI couldn&#x27;t tune thresholds blindly. I needed ground truth on which query pairs were actually \"the same.\"Our methodology:Step 1: Sample query pairs. I sampled 5,000 query pairs at various similarity levels (0.80-0.99).Step 2: Human labeling. Annotators labeled each pair as \"same intent\" or \"different intent.\" I used three annotators per pair and took a majority vote.Step 3: Compute precision/recall curves. For each threshold, we computed:Precision: Of cache hits, what fraction had the same intent?Recall: Of same-intent pairs, what fraction did we cache-hit?def compute_precision_recall(pairs, labels, threshold): \"\"\"Compute precision and recall at given similarity threshold.\"\"\" predictions = [1 if pair.similarity >= threshold else 0 for pair in pairs] true_positives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 1 and l == 1) false_positives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 1 and l == 0) false_negatives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 0 and l == 1) precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives) if (true_positives + false_positives) > 0 else 0 recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives) if (true_positives + false_negatives) > 0 else 0 return precision, recallStep 4: Select threshold based on cost of errors. For FAQ queries where wrong answers damage trust, I optimized for precision (0.94 threshold gave 98% precision). For search queries where missing a cache hit just costs money, I optimized for recall (0.88 threshold).Latency overheadSemantic caching adds latency: You must embed the query and search the vector store before knowing whether to call the LLM.Our measurements:OperationLatency (p50)Latency (p99)Query embedding12ms28msVector search8ms19msTotal cache lookup20ms47msLLM API call850ms2400msThe 20ms overhead is negligible compared to the 850ms LLM call we avoid on cache hits. Even at p99, the 47ms overhead is acceptable.However, cache misses now take 20ms longer than before (embedding + search + LLM call). At our 67% hit rate, the math works out favorably:Before: 100% of queries × 850ms = 850ms averageAfter: (33% × 870ms) + (67% × 20ms) = 287ms + 13ms = 300ms averageNet latency improvement of 65% alongside the cost reduction.Cache invalidationCached responses go stale. Product information changes, policies update and yesterday&#x27;s correct answer becomes today&#x27;s wrong answer.I implemented three invalidation strategies:Time-based TTLSimple expiration based on content type:TTL_BY_CONTENT_TYPE = { &#x27;pricing&#x27;: timedelta(hours=4), # Changes frequently &#x27;policy&#x27;: timedelta(days=7), # Changes rarely &#x27;product_info&#x27;: timedelta(days=1), # Daily refresh &#x27;general_faq&#x27;: timedelta(days=14), # Very stable}Event-based invalidationWhen underlying data changes, invalidate related cache entries:class CacheInvalidator: def on_content_update(self, content_id: str, content_type: str): \"\"\"Invalidate cache entries related to updated content.\"\"\" # Find cached queries that referenced this content affected_queries = self.find_queries_referencing(content_id) for query_id in affected_queries: self.cache.invalidate(query_id) self.log_invalidation(content_id, len(affected_queries))Staleness detectionFor responses that might become stale without explicit events, I implemented periodic freshness checks:def check_freshness(self, cached_response: dict) -> bool: \"\"\"Verify cached response is still valid.\"\"\" # Re-run the query against current data fresh_response = self.generate_response(cached_response[&#x27;query&#x27;]) # Compare semantic similarity of responses cached_embedding = self.embed(cached_response[&#x27;response&#x27;]) fresh_embedding = self.embed(fresh_response) similarity = cosine_similarity(cached_embedding, fresh_embedding) # If responses diverged significantly, invalidate if similarity < 0.90: self.cache.invalidate(cached_response[&#x27;id&#x27;]) return False return TrueWe run freshness checks on a sample of cached entries daily, catching staleness that TTL and event-based invalidation miss.Production resultsAfter three months in production:MetricBeforeAfterChangeCache hit rate18%67%+272%LLM API costs$47K/month$12.7K/month-73%Average latency850ms300ms-65%False-positive rateN/A0.8%—Customer complaints (wrong answers)Baseline+0.3%Minimal increaseThe 0.8% false-positive rate (queries where we returned a cached response that was semantically incorrect) was within acceptable bounds. These cases occurred primarily at the boundaries of our threshold, where similarity was just above the cutoff but intent differed slightly.Pitfalls to avoidDon&#x27;t use a single global threshold. Different query types have different tolerance for errors. Tune thresholds per category.Don&#x27;t skip the embedding step on cache hits. You might be tempted to skip embedding overhead when returning cached responses, but you need the embedding for cache key generation. The overhead is unavoidable.Don&#x27;t forget invalidation. Semantic caching without invalidation strategy leads to stale responses that erode user trust. Build invalidation from day one.Don&#x27;t cache everything. Some queries shouldn&#x27;t be cached: Personalized responses, time-sensitive information, transactional confirmations. Build exclusion rules.def should_cache(self, query: str, response: str) -> bool: \"\"\"Determine if response should be cached.\"\" # Don&#x27;t cache personalized responses if self.contains_personal_info(response): return False # Don&#x27;t cache time-sensitive information if self.is_time_sensitive(query): return False # Don&#x27;t cache transactional confirmations if self.is_transactional(query): return False return TrueKey takeawaysSemantic caching is a practical pattern for LLM cost control that captures redundancy exact-match caching misses. The key challenges are threshold tuning (use query-type-specific thresholds based on precision/recall analysis) and cache invalidation (combine TTL, event-based and staleness detection).At 73% cost reduction, this was our highest-ROI optimization for production LLM systems. The implementation complexity is moderate, but the threshold tuning requires careful attention to avoid quality degradation.Sreenivasa Reddy Hulebeedu Reddy is a lead software engineer.",

Each semantically-similar query triggered a full LLM call, generating a response nearly identical to one we&#x27;d already computed.Semantic caching architectureSemantic caching replaces text-based keys with embedding-based similarity lookup:class SemanticCache: def __init__(self, embedding_model, similarity_threshold=0.92): self.embedding_model = embedding_model self.threshold = similarity_threshold self.vector_store = VectorStore() # FAISS, Pinecone, etc. self.response_store = ResponseStore() # Redis, DynamoDB, etc. def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]: \"\"\"Return cached response if semantically similar query exists.\"\"\" query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) # Find most similar cached query matches = self.vector_store.search(query_embedding, top_k=1) if matches and matches[0].similarity >= self.threshold: cache_id = matches[0].id return self.response_store.get(cache_id) return None def set(self, query: str, response: str): \"\"\"Cache query-response pair.\"\"\" query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) cache_id = generate_id() self.vector_store.add(cache_id, query_embedding) self.response_store.set(cache_id, { &#x27;query&#x27;: query, &#x27;response&#x27;: response, &#x27;timestamp&#x27;: datetime.utcnow() })The key insight: Instead of hashing query text, I embed queries into vector space and find cached queries within a similarity threshold.The threshold problemThe similarity threshold is the critical parameter. Set it too high, and you miss valid cache hits. Set it too low, and you return wrong responses.Our initial threshold of 0.85 seemed reasonable; 85% similar should be \"the same question,\" right?Wrong. At 0.85, we got cache hits like:Query: \"How do I cancel my subscription?\"Cached: \"How do I cancel my order?\"Similarity: 0.87These are different questions with different answers. Returning the cached response would be incorrect.I discovered that optimal thresholds vary by query type:Query typeOptimal thresholdRationaleFAQ-style questions0.94High precision needed; wrong answers damage trustProduct searches0.88More tolerance for near-matchesSupport queries0.92Balance between coverage and accuracyTransactional queries0.97Very low tolerance for errorsI implemented query-type-specific thresholds:class AdaptiveSemanticCache: def __init__(self): self.thresholds = { &#x27;faq&#x27;: 0.94, &#x27;search&#x27;: 0.88, &#x27;support&#x27;: 0.92, &#x27;transactional&#x27;: 0.97, &#x27;default&#x27;: 0.92 } self.query_classifier = QueryClassifier() def get_threshold(self, query: str) -> float: query_type = self.query_classifier.classify(query) return self.thresholds.get(query_type, self.thresholds[&#x27;default&#x27;]) def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]: threshold = self.get_threshold(query) query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query) matches = self.vector_store.search(query_embedding, top_k=1) if matches and matches[0].similarity >= threshold: return self.response_store.get(matches[0].id) return NoneThreshold tuning methodologyI couldn&#x27;t tune thresholds blindly. I needed ground truth on which query pairs were actually \"the same.\"Our methodology:Step 1: Sample query pairs. I sampled 5,000 query pairs at various similarity levels (0.80-0.99).Step 2: Human labeling. Annotators labeled each pair as \"same intent\" or \"different intent.\" I used three annotators per pair and took a majority vote.Step 3: Compute precision/recall curves. For each threshold, we computed:Precision: Of cache hits, what fraction had the same intent?Recall: Of same-intent pairs, what fraction did we cache-hit?def compute_precision_recall(pairs, labels, threshold): \"\"\"Compute precision and recall at given similarity threshold.\"\"\" predictions = [1 if pair.similarity >= threshold else 0 for pair in pairs] true_positives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 1 and l == 1) false_positives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 1 and l == 0) false_negatives = sum(1 for p, l in zip(predictions, labels) if p == 0 and l == 1) precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives) if (true_positives + false_positives) > 0 else 0 recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives) if (true_positives + false_negatives) > 0 else 0 return precision, recallStep 4: Select threshold based on cost of errors. For FAQ queries where wrong answers damage trust, I optimized for precision (0.94 threshold gave 98% precision). For search queries where missing a cache hit just costs money, I optimized for recall (0.88 threshold).Latency overheadSemantic caching adds latency: You must embed the query and search the vector store before knowing whether to call the LLM.Our measurements:OperationLatency (p50)Latency (p99)Query embedding12ms28msVector search8ms19msTotal cache lookup20ms47msLLM API call850ms2400msThe 20ms overhead is negligible compared to the 850ms LLM call we avoid on cache hits. Even at p99, the 47ms overhead is acceptable.However, cache misses now take 20ms longer than before (embedding + search + LLM call). At our 67% hit rate, the math works out favorably:Before: 100% of queries × 850ms = 850ms averageAfter: (33% × 870ms) + (67% × 20ms) = 287ms + 13ms = 300ms averageNet latency improvement of 65% alongside the cost reduction.Cache invalidationCached responses go stale. Product information changes, policies update and yesterday&#x27;s correct answer becomes today&#x27;s wrong answer.I implemented three invalidation strategies:Time-based TTLSimple expiration based on content type:TTL_BY_CONTENT_TYPE = { &#x27;pricing&#x27;: timedelta(hours=4), # Changes frequently &#x27;policy&#x27;: timedelta(days=7), # Changes rarely &#x27;product_info&#x27;: timedelta(days=1), # Daily refresh &#x27;general_faq&#x27;: timedelta(days=14), # Very stable}Event-based invalidationWhen underlying data changes, invalidate related cache entries:class CacheInvalidator: def on_content_update(self, content_id: str, content_type: str): \"\"\"Invalidate cache entries related to updated content.\"\"\" # Find cached queries that referenced this content affected_queries = self.find_queries_referencing(content_id) for query_id in affected_queries: self.cache.invalidate(query_id) self.log_invalidation(content_id, len(affected_queries))Staleness detectionFor responses that might become stale without explicit events, I implemented periodic freshness checks:def check_freshness(self, cached_response: dict) -> bool: \"\"\"Verify cached response is still valid.\"\"\" # Re-run the query against current data fresh_response = self.generate_response(cached_response[&#x27;query&#x27;]) # Compare semantic similarity of responses cached_embedding = self.embed(cached_response[&#x27;response&#x27;]) fresh_embedding = self.embed(fresh_response) similarity = cosine_similarity(cached_embedding, fresh_embedding) # If responses diverged significantly, invalidate if similarity < 0.90: self.cache.invalidate(cached_response[&#x27;id&#x27;]) return False return TrueWe run freshness checks on a sample of cached entries daily, catching staleness that TTL and event-based invalidation miss.Production resultsAfter three months in production:MetricBeforeAfterChangeCache hit rate18%67%+272%LLM API costs$47K/month$12.7K/month-73%Average latency850ms300ms-65%False-positive rateN/A0.8%—Customer complaints (wrong answers)Baseline+0.3%Minimal increaseThe 0.8% false-positive rate (queries where we returned a cached response that was semantically incorrect) was within acceptable bounds. These cases occurred primarily at the boundaries of our threshold, where similarity was just above the cutoff but intent differed slightly.Pitfalls to avoidDon&#x27;t use a single global threshold. Different query types have different tolerance for errors. Tune thresholds per category.Don&#x27;t skip the embedding step on cache hits. You might be tempted to skip embedding overhead when returning cached responses, but you need the embedding for cache key generation. The overhead is unavoidable.Don&#x27;t forget invalidation. Semantic caching without invalidation strategy leads to stale responses that erode user trust. Build invalidation from day one.Don&#x27;t cache everything. Some queries shouldn&#x27;t be cached: Personalized responses, time-sensitive information, transactional confirmations. Build exclusion rules.def should_cache(self, query: str, response: str) -> bool: \"\"\"Determine if response should be cached.\"\" # Don&#x27;t cache personalized responses if self.contains_personal_info(response): return False # Don&#x27;t cache time-sensitive information if self.is_time_sensitive(query): return False # Don&#x27;t cache transactional confirmations if self.is_transactional(query): return False return TrueKey takeawaysSemantic caching is a practical pattern for LLM cost control that captures redundancy exact-match caching misses. The key challenges are threshold tuning (use query-type-specific thresholds based on precision/recall analysis) and cache invalidation (combine TTL, event-based and staleness detection).At 73% cost reduction, this was our highest-ROI optimization for production LLM systems. The implementation complexity is moderate, but the threshold tuning requires careful attention to avoid quality degradation.Sreenivasa Reddy Hulebeedu Reddy is a lead software engineer.",

          "standfirst": "At every CES I’ve ever been to, there’s been one or two gadgets promising to boost your mental health. In recent years, the number of companies making forays into this space has grown, and will likely continue to do so in the future. Could it be, much like the number of people wearing heart-monitoring wearables today, everyone will be strapping an EEG to their skulls a decade or so down the line? It’s more likely than you think, so it’s worth asking what these devices are good for, what benefit they could bring, and where does the science end and the hype begin.An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a clinical tool to monitor the electrical activity of our brains. Put very simply, our minds are constantly moving ions around, and when they reach the scalp, it’s possible to measure those ions. By placing electrodes on the scalp, you can record the changes in voltages pushed out by our brains more or less in real time. These voltages are commonly grouped into categories, which are often described as brain waves. Each one represents a different state of mind: Gamma (hard thinking), Beta (anxious or active), Alpha (relaxed), Theta (creative, or dreaming) and Delta (asleep). Professor Karl Friston at University College London is one of the world’s most influential neuroscientists and an expert in brain imaging. He explained that these technologies can be used to diagnose issues both in the structure and function of the brain. And while there are many technologies which can look at how our brains work, “we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.” Broadly speaking, EEGs are a fairly simple tool for looking at how our minds work, but they have one benefit over more complex methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), since they work in real time.Consumer-use EEGs are nothing new — in 2011 I tested the Zeo Mobile, a small device which you stuck to your forehead and wore overnight. It monitored how well you slept and sounded an alarm when you were at the top of a sleep cycle, so you woke up pretty easily. It worked well but with one downside: It’s hard to sleep with a hard plastic puck stuck to your forehead.EEGs are more recently used as part of brain computer interfaces, or for neurofeedback tools to help you calibrate the quality of your meditation. InteraXon, for instance, makes the Muse headbands which will monitor your brain waves, telling you when you shift states. Last year, EEG startup Neurable partnered with Master & Dynamic to launch the MW75S Neuro, a pair of high-end headphones designed to track your focus levels. When your attention starts to wane, the system will alert you, advising you to take a rest with the hope of alleviating burnout.NeurableDaniel Cooper for EngadgetAt CES this year, Neurable announced a partnership with HP’s gaming arm HyperX to produce EEG headsets with specific benefits for gamers. As gamers are looking for any way to improve their performance, the company has developed algorithms and training programs to help. You might already know that being in a place of high stress isn’t great for your concentration and focus. Consequently, Neurable research scientist Dr. Alicia Howell-Munson walked me through a system that encourages you to reach a state of calm focus with demonstrable improvements in reaction time and accuracy. It’s a system that was initially designed in partnership with Singapore’s Air Force to help ensure pilots remain in a state of calm focus. I sat through this demo myself, initially testing my skills in Aimlabs (a tool people use to test their reflexes) where my accuracy and reaction times were measured. Then, while wearing Neurable’s headset, I had to practice focusing my attention on a galaxy of dots, the greater my focus, the slower and closer together the dots got. That wasn’t an easy process, and it took me nearly five minutes to reach the point where I could push all of the dots to coalesce into a single point on the screen. But, when I had, I retook the shooting gallery, and saw dramatic spikes in my performance. My accuracy increased from 91.3 to 99.1 percent, while my reaction time fell from 623ms to 532ms. Neurable HyperX headsetDaniel Cooper for EngadgetNeurable believes that its systems, which are designed to integrate with any manufacturer’s gear, has the potential to dramatically increase a person’s brain health and productivity. For instance, by taking a break when a person’s focus started to wane, they were able to bounce back and function for far longer than if they’d simply pushed harder. Similarly, the company can advise on your cognitive speed and brain age and guide you toward making healthy choices. The company says that this isn’t just about wellness, either, as being able to identify loss of focus is vital, for instance, to help reduce auto accidents when truck drivers feel fatigued. Co-founder Adam Molnar explained that the benefits of this technology compound over time, so the more practice a user has in finding that mental state of calm focus, the easier it will be to maintain it for longer. CEO Ramses Alcaide added the company’s aim is to enable people to visualize the often invisible symptoms of cognitive stress to ensure they’re looking after themselves. He added that one thing that separates Neurable from other companies is that it’s looking at far finer-grain detail from its EEG data. MyWavesDaniel Cooper for EngadgetThere are plenty of companies at CES that are using EEGs for more specific goals, such as MyWaves. It uses an EEG as part of its broader offering to use sound patterns to make it easier to go to sleep. It sells you a pricey forehead-worn EEG which you wear for a few nights over the course of a year. From there, the system produces a half hour audio file that will mirror the pattern of your delta brainwaves. It claims that, if you listen to the track before you go to bed, the experience of hearing your delta waves will help you fall asleep faster and experience more REM sleep.And there are plenty of companies which are building EEGs for you to wear to keep an eye on your mental health. Brain-Life, for instance, showed off an early prototype of Focus+, a headband EEG with a companion app that can offer feedback on your cognitive load. It can also tell you how long you can sustain your attention and how well your mind relaxes and recovers. The company didn’t have details on when the hardware would be available or how much it cost, as it’s still early days.BrainEULink.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThere is broad potential to use an EEG as a brain computer interface, such as the one worked on by Braineulink. That company has combined an EEG with an AR headset to enable people to interact with the world just with their brains. For instance, in a demonstration in the show floor at CES, I was able to turn a light on and off by “focusing” on it, although it’s hard to know how useful that would be in, for instance, creating an assistive device for folks with limited mobility. Like Brain-Life, it’s early days, and so there’s no product that we can point to, but it’s clear we’re going to see more startups looking to enter this world. Brain-LifeDaniel Cooper for EngadgetAs EEGs become more commonplace, it’s likely they’ll be packaged in smaller devices which fit more seamlessly into our lives. One such example is NAOX, a French startup which has built a wearable, clinical-grade EEG into a pair of earbuds for the sort of longitudinal testing required to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. But the company is also planning on incorporating the technology into a pair of true wireless earbuds.These headphones won’t be arriving until the end of 2026, but Naox says the tech is small enough that it can be integrated with other companies earbuds. Consequently, it’s certainly plausible we could see plenty of earbuds that will keep an eye on our brain health as a side hustle.

For instance, if someone is to be diagnosed with a condition such as epilepsy, they need to undergo a 24-hour perambulatory EEG. As Professor Friston explained, the recording of that 24 hour EEG would be “carefully scrutinized by experts who are able to run a differential diagnosis ... to specify what further investigations are required.” He, like a lot of clinicians, is concerned about ill-informed consumers using these devices to make medical interventions without consulting a professional. Friston added that people shouldn’t expect wearable EEGs to be magic bullets for their brain health or cognition. He said the best way for a consumer to approach them is by treating them with the same level of reverence as a household thermometer. “Are thermometers useful in managing the wellness of my children?, Yes,” he explained, “can your thermometer tell you what particular virus you have? Absolutely not.” “In the context of well-being and to augment or validate practices such as mindfulness and meditation, they can be fun and useful quantitative devices.” But, fundamentally, that is all he feels they can be, especially right now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ces-companies-hoping-your-brain-is-the-next-big-thing-in-computing-175048601.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES always has its share of attention-grabbing robots. But this year in particular seemed to be a landmark year for robotics. The advancement in AI technology has not only given robots better “brains,” it’s enabled new levels of autonomy and given rise to an ambitious, if sometimes questionable, vision for our robot-filled future.From sassy humanoids to AI-powered pets and chore-handling assistants, we sought out as many cute, strange and capable robots as we could find in Las Vegas. These are the ones that made the biggest impression. Agibot HumanoidsAgibot's X2 humanoid robot.Karissa Bell for EngadgetOf all the humanoids we saw at CES, Agibot's made the biggest impression. The company was showing off two models: the larger A2 and the smaller X2 (pictured above). The latter impressed us with its dance moves — the company told us it can learn surprisingly complex choreography — but the A2 turned out to be surprisingly capable at chatting up CES goers.Later in the show, we came across the A2 at IntBot's booth, where the company had custom versions of both Agibot humanoids \"running\" their booth. I spent several minutes talking with \"Nylo\" and was genuinely impressed by its conversational skills, even if its roasts could use a little work. — Karissa Bell, Senior ReporterDreame's robo vac arms and legsDreame was back this year with some wild robot vacuums. The company showed of the Cyber 10 Ultra, a robot vacuum with a multipurpose extendable arm. The arm, which we got a glimpse of at last year's show, can pick up stuff, but it also has its own cleaning attachments, allowing the robot to clean hard-to-reach corners and other spots that wouldn't otherwise be accessible.Dreame also brought its latest wild concept, the Cyber X, which has legs that propel it up and down full-size staircases. The legs are somewhat unsettling — they look alarmingly similar to mini chainsaws — but watching it glide up and down stairs was impressive all the same. — KBOlloBotThe long neck version of OlloBot.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetOlloBot is one of those semi-ridiculous CES robots that's just impossible not to smile at. It has the goofiest face, with top-sitting frog eyes slapped onto a tablet where its mouth is displayed. Then, on top of that, it has a patch of soft fur on its neck and nowhere else on its body, which is penguin shaped and complete with flappy little arms. There are two versions of OlloBot, one that's short with a fixed neck and another where the neck can stretch out to make it much taller. And of course, it can be dressed up in silly outfits.It's a family-focused robot that responds to voice commands and touch, and is meant to capture memories as they happen, snapping pics and videos for its diary of notable moments. It can be used to make calls and control smart home devices. Everything is stored locally in its removable heart module, and there's a companion app for additional interactions. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorRovieA robot with a dust pan like appendage dumps toys into a bin.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetSure, we've seen multiple robots (particularly robovacuums) that can pick objects up off the floor and put them away to make homes tidier, but this one is cute and has a little face. Instead of using an arm to grab one thing at a time, Clutterbot's Rovie has a dustpan-style tray with two sweepers that fold out from its front. It drives around and, using computer vision, identifies toys that have been left on the floor and scoops them up. Then, it dumps them in a designated bin where they're consolidated and out of the way. It's still in the R&D phase, a team member said when I visited the booth, but this is one I'm hoping to see become a real, purchasable product soon. For parents of small children who are constantly leaving their toys around, it would be pretty convenient to have a tiny robot picking up after them. Also for me, who doesn't have children but a very sweet and hardworking cat who loves to steal socks and then deliver them as if they're her kills, leaving socks scattered all over the house. Clutterbot team, if you're reading this, please add socks to the list of items Rovie can sweep up. — CMSaros RoverNot to be outdone, Roborock also brought a stairclimbing robot vacuum to CES, Saros Rover. And, unlike Dreame's prototype, the Roborock can also clean the stairs while it climbs. No word on when it will be available or how much it might cost (probably a lot!) but the company says it is \"a real product in development.\" -KBCLOiDCLOiD folded laundry at LG's CES booth.Karissa Bell for EngadgetLG's CLOiD was definitely the most ambitious robot we saw at CES 2026. The company showed its home helper concept (slowly) folding and sorting laundry, fetching drinks from the fridge, putting food in the oven and retrieving a set of lost keys. But while the 15-minute demo gave us a tantalizing look at the appliance maker's vision for a \"zero labor home,\" it's unlikely to be anything more than a slick demo anytime soon. The company has made no commitment to actually make a version of CLOiD people can actually buy. — KBAllexWIRobotics' Allex robot makes a heart sign with its hands.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetWIRobotics brought its new humanoid, Allex, to CES, and the robot was really hamming it up when we stopped by the booth, striking poses and engaging with visitors. It's a waist-up robot with articulated parts, from its arms to its fingers, and is meant to be a general purpose tool that could be used in manufacturing, the service industry or even households. Each hand can hold objects of up to about 6.6 lbs, and the robotic hand has 15 degrees of freedom. The company's website shows the robot's fingers are dexterous enough to do the Gen-Z heart sign, but when it looked at Karissa and me it threw a millennial heart up. Did Allex lowkey call us unc? — CMPoketomoPoketomo in one of the many outfits Sharp brought to CES.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetSharp's Poketomo is an improbably adorable tiny meerkat. Well, technically it's an AI companion shaped like a fuzzy, portable meerkat. It might look like a toy, but the company says it's actually to be a companion for adults. It’s small enough you can carry it around with you throughout the day (Sharp even makes a tiny Poketomo-sized clear backpack). Like a lot of AI companion devices we saw at CES, it’s equipped with a small camera and microphone that enables it to constantly interact with you. The camera also enables its “memory” so the pet can recognize and deliver personalized updates to its person. Poketomo launched recently in Japan, but sadly Sharp says it has no current plans to sell it in other markets. — KBBiboMoony bibo (I-Type).Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetIt seemed like everyone was trying to cash in on Labubu hype at CES 2026. There were Pop Mart-style bag charms all over the place and countless products that looked suspiciously like the now ubiquitous toy monster. We even got one pitch for a \"a labubu-like robot that talks to you\" that, in fact, did not look like a Labubu in any way, shape or form. But there was one truly Labubu-like tiny robot that managed to stand out from the rest and kind of stole my heart, even though I'm not particularly into Labubus. (Please don't make me say Labubu ever again.)Bibo is a cute-as-hell AI toy that's meant to be a companion you bring with you everywhere. It has a little camera on its head that it uses to see the world around it, and can recognize its owner's face and tone of voice, so it can respond to interactions in an emotionally appropriate way. It'll keep a daily diary of its activities, and while the toy comes in two starting personality \"types\" — Sunny bibo (E-Type), the bubbly extrovert, and Moony bibo (I-Type), the gentle, sensitive one — they'll develop more unique personalities over time. Their fur is soft and warm, so it feels like you're petting a kitten.Why is it even cuter like this?Cheyenne MacDonaldAt the booth, the team had several of them on display wearing various outfits, in little dioramas showing them in classroom and camping scenes, and even deconstructed with the fur removed, which somehow made it look even cuter. Bibo isn't available to purchase yet, and when it is, it'll launch first in China before potentially expanding depending on its success at home. — CMSharpaSharpa's humanoid robot is seen playing ping-pong.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetSharpa's booth had a lot going on and was definitely one of the bigger crowd-pullers. There was a humanoid robot playing ping-pong, another taking selfies with people and another dealing blackjack, along with a disembodied robotic hand that could mirror visitors' finger movements. The autonomous demos showed off what that highly dexterous hand can do, and it was pretty impressive — especially seeing it draw individual cards from the deck. — CMZerothZeroth's W1 robot.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetChinese robotics startup Zeroth brought two adorable home robots to CES: a pint-sized humanoid companion bot and a rolling robot that looks like Wall-E, with tank-style tracked treads so it can ride around outside. We didn't see these guys doing too much, but they sure were cute. The one that resembles Wall-E, called W1, kind of melted my heart just looking at it. (Don't get attached, you can't afford it.) The tiny humanoid, M1, costs $2,400 while W1 costs $5,000. Both are expected to ship this spring, with a tentative date of April 15. — CMSweekarSweekars in their little outfits.Karissa Bell for EngadgetTakway's Sweekar pocket pet was something I looked at and immediately thought, sigh, I'm going to buy that. It's a Tamagotchi-like virtual pet with AI smarts so it can form a personality based on your interactions with it and the activities you do together. The idea is that it \"grows\" with you. Like a Tamagotchi, it will require more frequent care in the younger stages of its life cycle. But after it reaches the adult level, it autonomously cares for itself, and it never dies. It can eventually keep itself entertained, and go off on its own virtual adventures and bring you back tales of its travels. Sweekar is super cute as is, and it can be dressed up in little outfits for more personalization. The device comes in light yellow, pink, and blue, and we saw it sporting a snowboarder outfit and a full cowboy getup. — CMRealbotixOne of Realbotix' robots. Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetRealbotix is a company we've seen a lot at CES over the years, and it was at the show again for 2026 with several of its highly customizable, realistic humanoid robots. As always, it was among the most unnerving exhibits we saw. New for this year, Realbotix was demonstrating its Robotic Vision System, which allows its robots to see and react to their surroundings more naturally, tracking faces to look directly at whoever is talking and better reading emotion from facial expressions. Damn, it can sense my fear now… — CMOnero H1Onero H1 had an endearingly blank stare.Karissa Bell for EngadgetSwitchbot surprised us with its own chore-handling robot, Onero H1, which also won Engadget editors' pick for best robot of CES 2026. We were immediately taken by its weirdly long body and endearingly blank stare as it slowly wheeled around picking up laundry and depositing the items in a washing machine. Like a lot of robot demos we saw at CES, we only saw Onero performing a small part of what Switchbot says it's actually capable of. But Onero also seemed much more realistic in terms of the type of robot helpers that people might actually see outside of CES, and the company told us it does plan to sell Onero (albeit in limited quantities) by the end of the year. — KBCocomoLudens AI Cocomo robot.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAnother robot pet that won us over immediately was Cocomo. Created by Japanese startup Ludens AI, Cocomo is an autonomous robot friend that yes, uses AI to respond to voice and touch and is meant to bond with its owners over time. The egg-shaped creature can scoot around on a wheeled base, or you can carry it around with you. But what we loved about Cocomo is that it's not trying to be yet another AI assistant, give out life advice or perform tasks. Its goal is to provide companionship and well, be your friend. And while it can respond to voice input it doesn't exactly have a voice of its own: it communicates via cute humming sounds, which is a lot less creepy than some of the talking robots we saw. — KB Yonbo Yonbo at CES.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetYonbo is a kids' AI companion robot that totally charmed us. It kind of looks like a dog, and when we visited its booth at Unveiled, there were four of them playfully bopping their heads to a pop song and cycling through different cute facial expressions and emoji eyes (including bowls of ramen). It's designed to be an intelligent playmate that can tag along for activities, talk with a child and read them stories, and even help them work through emotions, like getting frustrated during a game. Yonbo's movement is controlled by a wristband, so it doesn't require a phone to play with. It can also be used as an extra pair of eyes for parents around the house. In Parental Monitor mode, which the team says is the only time its camera will be able to stream and store video, parents are able to see what Yonbo sees. The robot costs $800 and is available now. — CMMÖFOMÖFO in a glass case at CES.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetIf we're being completely honest, the pitch for will.i.am's MÖFO (yes, MOFO, like motherfucker) had us a bit, um, perplexed for a hot second. We read it and all the accompanying materials over and over trying to figure out what, exactly, this thing does. Some of the claims that added to this confusion: \"the agent 'octopuses' across your digital ecosystem through its eight USB-C connections\"; it \"converts moments into objects\"; it \"turns life notes into a life operating system.\" We get it now, (we think): It's agentic AI hardware, kind of like a Rabbit R1 or AI Pin but in the form of a teddy bear. Sadly, we didn't get to see MÖFO up close or watch it do anything, but we are nonetheless intrigued, if still a bit confused, by this strange teddy bear. — CM and KBThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-robots-we-saw-at-ces-2026-the-lovable-the-creepy-and-the-utterly-confusing-153537930.html?src=rss",
          "content": "CES always has its share of attention-grabbing robots. But this year in particular seemed to be a landmark year for robotics. The advancement in AI technology has not only given robots better “brains,” it’s enabled new levels of autonomy and given rise to an ambitious, if sometimes questionable, vision for our robot-filled future.From sassy humanoids to AI-powered pets and chore-handling assistants, we sought out as many cute, strange and capable robots as we could find in Las Vegas. These are the ones that made the biggest impression. Agibot HumanoidsAgibot's X2 humanoid robot.Karissa Bell for EngadgetOf all the humanoids we saw at CES, Agibot's made the biggest impression. The company was showing off two models: the larger A2 and the smaller X2 (pictured above). The latter impressed us with its dance moves — the company told us it can learn surprisingly complex choreography — but the A2 turned out to be surprisingly capable at chatting up CES goers.Later in the show, we came across the A2 at IntBot's booth, where the company had custom versions of both Agibot humanoids \"running\" their booth. I spent several minutes talking with \"Nylo\" and was genuinely impressed by its conversational skills, even if its roasts could use a little work. — Karissa Bell, Senior ReporterDreame's robo vac arms and legsDreame was back this year with some wild robot vacuums.

          "standfirst": "Chances are that you're here because you've heard a virtual private network (VPN) can change your virtual location, and want to know what that means. If you know already, head over to my best VPN list to learn which services I recommend for changing your location. But if you're clueless, read on.Whenever any device connects to the internet — whether it's a laptop, a phone or a smart Lego brick — it's assigned a unique IP address that other devices can use to identify it. Think of the name you give the barista at a coffee shop, except instead of a hot beverage, you’re being served websites and digital audio and video.That's the upside. The downside is that a device's IP address can be used to find its location in the real world. That means service providers can show you local weather reports — as well as targeted local ads. More ominously, however, it means service providers can restrict what you see online based on where you are physically. That impacts everything from the fun (what Netflix has available to stream) to the serious (what information gets censored on the government's behalf).A VPN gets around that downside by running all your online activity through a middleman server before sending it to its destination. Instead of your real IP address, everyone sees the address of the VPN server, along with its geolocation. That means you can subvert any local restrictions getting in your way: You’re actually in Houston, but so far as the website you’re viewing is concerned, you seem to be coming from Amsterdam. Here's how to do it.How to change your virtual location with a VPNWith so many excellent commercial VPNs on the market, changing your virtual location is a lot easier than it sounds. You don't need to be a hacker — just find a good VPN app and connect to a server in your desired location. On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.Sam Chapman for EngadgetHowever, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I've laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.How to change location on Windows or MacUse these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget's best VPN list or, if you're unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the best free VPNs. My personal choice is Proton VPN, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it's a forever-free service, this is when you'll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you're sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the best VPN deals for ideas.Download the VPN app. It's best to go through the VPN's website, even if you're on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you're trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you're in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you're after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like WhatIsMyIPAddress to check where you're coming from.When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you're in.It's not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN's kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren't perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn't visible for a millisecond.How to change location on iPhone or AndroidThe process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it's done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research. Make sure you're getting the real version of your chosen VPN and not a similarly named one trying to piggyback.Download the VPN from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. At this point, if you haven't paid yet, you may be able to take advantage of a free trial by opening the app and proceeding through the setup flow. This is a good time to test if the VPN is changing your location in ways that can't be seen through.Follow the VPN's instructions to create an account, including paying for a subscription if necessary.Take some time to learn to use the VPN app. Mobile interfaces have to pack more features into a smaller space, usually relying on tabs. Try and find the tabs for picking server locations and toggling VPN settings.Connect to a server in your desired location. Make sure the VPN is actually active before you proceed (most of them make it pretty clear, but it's still easy to forget).Get online through a browser or another internet-capable app.When you're finished, disconnect from the VPN to return to using your real location.One more note: on both mobile and desktop, I recommend using either a paid VPN or a free VPN supported by a paid subscription. Entirely free VPNs come with risks, and some popular apps secretly share problematic connections. Why change your virtual location?Changing your virtual location isn't hard, but it's still an extra step between you and the internet. However, the benefits of location masking far outweigh the small amount of extra work. Hiding your IP address — and your location along with it — is one of the most impactful steps you can take to stay safe online.Concealing your IP address has massive benefits on its own, even if you use one close to your real location (which gets you shorter loading times). Lots of web services track you without your consent, frequently for advertising purposes. Some of this is done through third-party cookies, but a lot of it starts with building profiles about your IP address.Illicit actors can also take advantage of your IP address and its geolocation. A hacker can track you down to within your ZIP code — though an IP address can't pinpoint your location to the square foot, it makes it much easier to narrow down where you live. Even with just your IP address, hackers can launch DDoS attacks against you, use the IP to make fake social media accounts in your name or even call in SWAT teams to your location.By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren't listed in the US.Sam Chapman for EngadgetAlthough masking your virtual location can be vital to staying safe online, there are other practical and even fun reasons to do it. For one thing, when traveling abroad, you might want to use a site only available in your home country. Simply connect to a server located near home and you can use your bank account and local streaming libraries as normal.If you're home, there are lots of benefits to being virtually in another region. You can see a foreign country's streaming libraries and shop for deals that may only be available in its currency. You can also get around any nationwide online censorship and potentially download banned apps. Just be sure to be aware of your local laws to know if doing so is merely frowned upon, or if it’s truly against the law.Can a VPN change your GPS location?There's one more critical point to remember when changing location with a VPN. The VPN server only changes your IP address and the physical location associated with it. It does not change the GPS location your device might be broadcasting.GPS data can leak out in a few ways. Tablets and phones have location services turned on by default, and as anyone who's heard a true crime podcast knows, they can also give away your location by contacting cell towers. Web browsers often have similar features. Websites can also use HTML5 geolocation to access your GPS — provided you give permission, but that's easy to do without thinking.Some VPNs, including Surfshark and Windscribe, do have features designed to fool GPS, but they're not standard. When you're changing your location with a VPN, make sure to turn off location services and avoid granting any permissions that might reveal where you really are. You can also run a separate GPS spoofing app alongside your VPN.How to troubleshoot a VPN that's not changing your locationIf you've found that browsers are still seeing your old IP address while you have a VPN active, or that websites show you the same content when you're supposed to be virtually abroad, there's a chance your VPN isn't actually changing your location. To test if your real position is leaking, start by checking your IP address (with a search engine or WhatIsMyIPAddress). If it matches your home location, something has gone wrong.Note that it's not necessarily a problem if it doesn't match your home location or the stated location of your VPN server. VPNs use virtual server locations to reach a lot of locations where brick-and-mortar servers aren't practical — Windscribe, for example, does not have a physical data center in Antarctica.If you find that your VPN is leaking your real IP address, try these troubleshooting steps in order. I've arranged them roughly from least to most time-intensive.Disconnect from your VPN and reconnect to the same location. This should hook you up with a different server in that same place. Test your IP again — there's a good chance the problem was isolated to the first server you tried.Try a new location (skip this step if you need a server in a particular country).Try a different VPN protocol. If you're using WireGuard, switch to OpenVPN or IKEv2.Make sure location services are turned off.Clear your browser cache and cookies to get rid of any saved information.Test for DNS leaks. Your VPN might accidentally be sending your IP address to a public server to resolve DNS requests. IPleak.org is a good tool for catching this.Try a different VPN. Use a free service like Proton or Windscribe and test for leaks. If the problem reoccurs, it might be coming from inside your network.Contact the helpdesk for your original VPN and inform them about the problem. Get screenshots of the VPN connected to the leaky location next to IP address data confirming the leak.I've already mentioned several VPNs that do a good job of changing your location, but in case you're here for product advice, here are all my recommendations in one place. My favorite VPN is Proton VPN, which is so far the only service to receive full marks on my location-change test. I used 15 of its servers in five different countries to access Netflix. Each time, I saw the destination country's full content library like I was really there.Surfshark is a close runner-up in this category. It passed 14 out of 15 tests, only slipping up once in Japan — and a quick disconnect and reconnect was enough to fix that. I got equally great results from ExpressVPN, only having to retry one server in the UK. NordVPN performed perfectly in every location except Nigeria, and that still didn't leak my real IP address. The problem only seemed to exist on Netflix.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Chances are that you're here because you've heard a virtual private network (VPN) can change your virtual location, and want to know what that means. If you know already, head over to my best VPN list to learn which services I recommend for changing your location. But if you're clueless, read on.Whenever any device connects to the internet — whether it's a laptop, a phone or a smart Lego brick — it's assigned a unique IP address that other devices can use to identify it. Think of the name you give the barista at a coffee shop, except instead of a hot beverage, you’re being served websites and digital audio and video.That's the upside. The downside is that a device's IP address can be used to find its location in the real world. That means service providers can show you local weather reports — as well as targeted local ads. More ominously, however, it means service providers can restrict what you see online based on where you are physically. That impacts everything from the fun (what Netflix has available to stream) to the serious (what information gets censored on the government's behalf).A VPN gets around that downside by running all your online activity through a middleman server before sending it to its destination. Instead of your real IP address, everyone sees the address of the VPN server, along with its geolocation. That means you can subvert any local restrictions getting in your way: You’re actually in Houston, but so far as the website you’re viewing is concerned, you seem to be coming from Amsterdam. Here's how to do it.How to change your virtual location with a VPNWith so many excellent commercial VPNs on the market, changing your virtual location is a lot easier than it sounds. You don't need to be a hacker — just find a good VPN app and connect to a server in your desired location. On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.Sam Chapman for EngadgetHowever, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I've laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.How to change location on Windows or MacUse these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget's best VPN list or, if you're unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the best free VPNs. My personal choice is Proton VPN, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it's a forever-free service, this is when you'll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you're sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the best VPN deals for ideas.Download the VPN app. It's best to go through the VPN's website, even if you're on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you're trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you're in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you're after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like WhatIsMyIPAddress to check where you're coming from.When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you're in.It's not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN's kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren't perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn't visible for a millisecond.How to change location on iPhone or AndroidThe process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it's done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research.

          "standfirst": "Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, was out in full force covering the show. The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It's appropriate, I guess, that as we're beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry's insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI's supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.We're by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it's fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA's marathon keynote and Lenovo's somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it's been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of weird new gadgets, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.If you've been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there's still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBest robot: Switchbot Onero H1Onero H1 robotOneroWe saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot's Onero H1, which we watched pick up clothes and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year. The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It's also kind of cute. The company hasn't said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we'll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterBest accessibility tech: WheelMoveWheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairsCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetWheelMove offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It's portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn't overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editorBest TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)LG OLED Evo W6 \"Wallpaper TV\"LGI’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like LG’s OLED Evo W6. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest AI hardware: Subtle VoicebudsSubtle VoicebudsSubtleSubtle’s Voicebuds are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it's below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, and you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart homeIKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb rangeIKEAThe best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots. It seems every other company, from Bosch to LG to Samsung, had one or both of the buzzy technologies baked into their new smart home offerings. But IKEA came to its first CES with a simple lineup of basic, Matter-enabled smart plugs, sensors, lamps and remotes at screamingly good prices. Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff. There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own DIRIGERA or use a Matter hub you already own. The new lineup should land at IKEA’s website and stores sometime in January. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterBest home theater: Samsung HW-QS90HSamsung HW-QS90H soundbarBilly Steele for EngadgetMany companies claim their soundbars have enough bass that you don’t need a separate subwoofer. Those promises rarely pan out, even when the company devises new technology to solve the problem. With the HW-QS90H, Samsung is pledging to do the same with its Quad Bass woofer system. Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest audio: Shokz OpenFit ProShokz OpenFit ProShokzWhen it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off. Shokz is one of the few that has cracked the code with its OpenFit Pro. The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1Tone Outdoors T1Whisper AeroOutdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear. Tone Outdoors isn’t your usual power tool outfit though; it’s a spin-off of the aerospace engineering company Whisper Aero. Through its development of quieter electric airplane engines, Whisper Aero realized its technology had other uses. Enter the T1 leaf blower.The T1 is significantly quieter than most handheld gas models, clocking in at just 52 decibels of peak noise on average. It’s also more powerful than most of them with 880 CFM of airflow volume. The T1 can run longer too, and an upcoming backpack will extend run time for several hours. But the most important advancement here is not annoying your neighbors — or yourself — when it’s time to do some yard work. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest toy: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoLego is constantly evolving, but rarely does it make as big a move as it did with Smart Play. The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life. The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego's Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader's TIE fighter, and you'll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don't need to know how it works — it just does. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editorBest PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16The Dell XPS 14 and 16.DellIn a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself. Last year, Dell showed up with a new naming scheme for all of its hardware that included replacing the iconic XPS line with the word “Premium.” And despite our objections, the company followed through with the rebrand. But now at CES 2026, not only has Dell admitted its mistake, it’s righting wrongs with two new members of the XPS family that are exactly what we wanted all along.On the XPS 14 and XPS 16, we’re getting brand new chassis featuring the latest chips from Intel, gorgeous tandem OLED displays and precision engineering that embodies everything we loved about XPS laptops from previous years. Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor. But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet. There are also placeholders for two more XPS models slated to arrive in the not too distant future. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest health tech: Eyebot vision test boothEyebot vision testEyebotWouldn’t it be nice if getting an updated eyeglasses prescription wasn’t as lengthy a process as it is right now? Eyebot’s new kiosk is designed to automate the process of visiting a doctor’s office to three minutes rocking up to a machine. It uses a combination of analog and digital wizardry to identify what you need to see properly in no time at all. Even better is that the prescriptions have to be signed off by a licensed eye doctor, so you can still rely on a degree of professional rigor. We like Eyebot because it proved itself in our tests: its brief examination matched my professionally completed prescription from last year. But its ability to make effective eye care accessible and affordable in a way that it isn’t at present is even more compelling than the tech itself. — Daniel Cooper, Senior reporterBest gaming tech: ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUSThe ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo is big, weird and potentially awkward to set up. But honestly, what kind of gamer doesn’t want more screens? Even if you can’t use its second display in the middle of a firefight, more real estate means extra room for Discord, build guides or anything else you might need. Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos. You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSamsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the Galaxy Z TriFold in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor. The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefMost promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovoConcept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market. But with the Legion Pro Rollable concept, Lenovo created something with a simple yet powerful premise: A gaming laptop with a screen that gets wider at the touch of a button.To make the Legion Pro Rollable, Lenovo took a regular Legion Pro 7i and then swapped its standard 16-inch display for a flexible one that can expand all the way up to 23.8 inches — with a bonus stop in between. This means you have the option to choose from 16:10, 21:9 or even 24:9 depending on the situation, which feels like an incredible way to enhance racing games, flight sims and anything else that can take advantage of extra wide aspect ratios. Granted, when its screen is fully deployed, it does look a bit ungainly. But of all the concepts we saw this year at CES, the Legion Pro Rollable is the one we hope survives to become a proper retail product someday. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest emerging technology: IXI autofocus lensesIXI Autofocus lensesIXIIXI’s autofocusing glasses were a late addition to our discussions, but we were impressed by what could be a significant advancement in spectacle technology — something that’s been largely static since the 1950s. IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user's eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds. Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription. Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe. The company has a busy year ahead as it turns its technology into a consumer product. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefBest in show: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoThere's perhaps no place better than CES to highlight how quickly industry trends die. Over the years the show has been a driver of cornerstone technologies like the VCR, DVD, flatscreen TVs, PDAs and more. Some trends stick, some don't.Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product: The company's core concept of creative play has remained in place throughout its long history, boosted by a gradual and ongoing evolution of block types and brand tie-ins.Announced at its first-ever CES press conference, Smart Play represents a thoughtful integration of technology to the classic toy. A tiny chip the size of a single Lego stud allows the company's Smart Bricks to sense what's around them, opening up new ways to play. The system will debut with a trio of Star Wars sets, but we’re sure Lego has plans for a wide range of licensed and unlicensed options.Our team instantly fell in love with Smart Play, and Deputy editor Nathan Ingraham had the opportunity to both build some sets and talk with some of the people behind the technology. Amid parental anxieties about screentime, it's refreshing that Smart Play doesn't require an app or a screen to get started. Kids can just get building. — Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Over 4,000 exhibitors flocked to Las Vegas, Nevada this week to showcase their wares at CES 2026. The Engadget team, as usual, was out in full force covering the show. The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It's appropriate, I guess, that as we're beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry's insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI's supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.We're by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it's fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models. So, away from all of the bombast of NVIDIA's marathon keynote and Lenovo's somehow simultaneously gaudy and dull Sphere show, it's been a pleasure to evaluate the crowd of weird new gadgets, appliances, toys and robots vying for our attention.Over the course of several days of exhaustive discussion and impassioned pitching, our CES team has whittled down the hundreds of products we saw to pick our favorites. Starting with an initial shortlist of around 50 candidates across a diverse range of product categories, we eventually landed on 15 winners and our singular best in show.If you've been with us all week, stay tuned for a lot more to come — despite publishing almost 200 articles from the show already, there's still plenty we have to tell you about. For now, though, here are our winners, each introduced by the editor most familiar with it. — Aaron Souppouris, Editor-in-chiefBest robot: Switchbot Onero H1Onero H1 robotOneroWe saw a lot of robots showing off intriguing and useful capabilities at CES 2026. While a lot of robots impressed us, there were fewer companies willing to commit to actually making them available. But Switchbot's Onero H1, which we watched pick up clothes and load a washing machine, is a helper robot the company intends to sell this year. The demo we saw was limited, but Switchbot claims it can help with an array of household chores (even if it might do them more slowly than a human). It's also kind of cute. The company hasn't said how much Onero will cost, though it promises the droid will be less than $10,000. A nearly five-figure price tag is still out of reach for most, but it at least gives us hope we'll see it somewhere outside of the CES showfloor. — Karissa Bell, Senior reporterBest accessibility tech: WheelMoveWheelMove power assist for manual wheelchairsCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetWheelMove offers a simple upgrade for manual wheelchairs that could make it much easier for the rider to navigate rough surfaces like grass and uneven dirt paths. The add-on is affixed to the front bars of the wheelchair and can lift the small caster wheels off the ground, in addition to providing power assistance with five speed options. It's portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful. It builds upon an existing category of wheelchair accessories to address a real issue in a way that doesn't overcomplicate things, and would work with the wheelchairs people already use. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend editorBest TV: LG Wallpaper TV (OLED Evo W6)LG OLED Evo W6 \"Wallpaper TV\"LGI’ve seen plenty of TVs at CES this year, but few stopped me in my tracks like LG’s OLED Evo W6. It’s the resurrection of the company’s “Wallpaper TV,” but this time it’s even thinner (about the depth of a pencil), and it’s no longer tied to a soundbar. It also uses LG’s wireless control box to reduce cabling — the only cord you need to hide is the one for power.And best of all, the OLED Evo W6 features LG’s latest OLED technology, which promises to be about 20 percent brighter than previous generations. Video demos looked absolutely stunning, with all of the wonderful contrast and black levels we’ve come to love from OLED. But it’s also a work of art when it’s turned off, one that practically disappears when viewed from an angle. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest AI hardware: Subtle VoicebudsSubtle VoicebudsSubtleSubtle’s Voicebuds are earbuds with a twist: They feature an AI model that’s trained to transcribe your voice accurately in very noisy environments, or when it's below a whisper in quiet spaces. We’ve seen these things in action on the bustling CES show floor, where they managed to transcribe several sentences amid the chaos. The only downsides is that the Voicebuds require internet access to use the best transcription models, and you need to subscribe to the Subtle app to use it. Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. — Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporterBest smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart homeIKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb rangeIKEAThe best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots. It seems every other company, from Bosch to LG to Samsung, had one or both of the buzzy technologies baked into their new smart home offerings. But IKEA came to its first CES with a simple lineup of basic, Matter-enabled smart plugs, sensors, lamps and remotes at screamingly good prices. Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff. There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own DIRIGERA or use a Matter hub you already own. The new lineup should land at IKEA’s website and stores sometime in January. — Amy Skorheim, Senior reporterBest home theater: Samsung HW-QS90HSamsung HW-QS90H soundbarBilly Steele for EngadgetMany companies claim their soundbars have enough bass that you don’t need a separate subwoofer. Those promises rarely pan out, even when the company devises new technology to solve the problem. With the HW-QS90H, Samsung is pledging to do the same with its Quad Bass woofer system. Those woofers move in two directions, producing a lot more low-end tone than most soundbars are capable of on their own. What’s more, Samsung included its Convertible Fit Design tech that debuted last year, so you can lay this speaker flat or mount it on a wall and the built-in sensors will automatically adjust the driver output accordingly. So, if you’ve longed for deep bass on a soundbar without a large or ugly sub in the corner, you may finally get your wish later this year. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest audio: Shokz OpenFit ProShokz OpenFit ProShokzWhen it comes to open fit earbuds, companies that claim to offer active noise cancellation (ANC) usually don’t deliver; It’s difficult to effectively block external sound when your ears aren’t completely sealed off. Shokz is one of the few that has cracked the code with its OpenFit Pro. The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1Tone Outdoors T1Whisper AeroOutdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear. Tone Outdoors isn’t your usual power tool outfit though; it’s a spin-off of the aerospace engineering company Whisper Aero. Through its development of quieter electric airplane engines, Whisper Aero realized its technology had other uses. Enter the T1 leaf blower.The T1 is significantly quieter than most handheld gas models, clocking in at just 52 decibels of peak noise on average. It’s also more powerful than most of them with 880 CFM of airflow volume. The T1 can run longer too, and an upcoming backpack will extend run time for several hours. But the most important advancement here is not annoying your neighbors — or yourself — when it’s time to do some yard work. — Billy Steele, Deputy editorBest toy: Lego Smart PlayLego Smart PlayLegoLego is constantly evolving, but rarely does it make as big a move as it did with Smart Play. The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life. The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego's Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader's TIE fighter, and you'll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don't need to know how it works — it just does. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editorBest PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16The Dell XPS 14 and 16.DellIn a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself. Last year, Dell showed up with a new naming scheme for all of its hardware that included replacing the iconic XPS line with the word “Premium.” And despite our objections, the company followed through with the rebrand. But now at CES 2026, not only has Dell admitted its mistake, it’s righting wrongs with two new members of the XPS family that are exactly what we wanted all along.On the XPS 14 and XPS 16, we’re getting brand new chassis featuring the latest chips from Intel, gorgeous tandem OLED displays and precision engineering that embodies everything we loved about XPS laptops from previous years. Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor. But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet. There are also placeholders for two more XPS models slated to arrive in the not too distant future. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest health tech: Eyebot vision test boothEyebot vision testEyebotWouldn’t it be nice if getting an updated eyeglasses prescription wasn’t as lengthy a process as it is right now? Eyebot’s new kiosk is designed to automate the process of visiting a doctor’s office to three minutes rocking up to a machine. It uses a combination of analog and digital wizardry to identify what you need to see properly in no time at all. Even better is that the prescriptions have to be signed off by a licensed eye doctor, so you can still rely on a degree of professional rigor. We like Eyebot because it proved itself in our tests: its brief examination matched my professionally completed prescription from last year. But its ability to make effective eye care accessible and affordable in a way that it isn’t at present is even more compelling than the tech itself. — Daniel Cooper, Senior reporterBest gaming tech: ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoASUSThe ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo is big, weird and potentially awkward to set up. But honestly, what kind of gamer doesn’t want more screens? Even if you can’t use its second display in the middle of a firefight, more real estate means extra room for Discord, build guides or anything else you might need. Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos. You also get a ton of ports, and with support for up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, the ROG Zephyrus Duo has more than enough performance to handle anything you can throw at it. — Sam Rutherford, Senior reporterBest mobile tech: Samsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSamsung Galaxy Z TriFoldSam Rutherford for EngadgetSamsung might have announced the latest iteration of its foldable smartphones in Korea, but CES was the first chance for many of us to see the Galaxy Z TriFold in person. It’s a 10-inch Android tablet hidden within a 6.5-inch smartphone form factor. The jump from the almost-square screen ratio of Samsung’s past foldables to approximately 4:3 is a major improvement. This is a device that I could happily watch entire movies on. There’s more horizontal space to read, more room to type and more bright, vivid AMOLED everything. Unfurling the sides is incredibly satisfying and, perhaps because it’s thicker, it has a reassuring heft, too. The rest of the spec sheet reflects another fashionable Galaxy phone with a 200-megapixel main camera and the biggest battery yet in a Samsung foldable.It’ll likely be expensive though. Samsung hasn’t confirmed pricing in the US, but based on its launch cost in Korea, it could be around $2,500. — Mat Smith, UK bureau chiefMost promising concept: Lenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovo Legion Pro RollableLenovoConcept devices are hard to judge because even the ones with a ton of potential might be too difficult to make or too niche to bring to market.

          "title": "Anthropic cracks down on unauthorized Claude usage by third-party harnesses and rivals",
          "standfirst": "Anthropic has confirmed the implementation of strict new technical safeguards preventing third-party applications from spoofing its official coding client, Claude Code, in order to access the underlying Claude AI models for more favorably pricing and limits — a move that has disrupted workflows for users of popular open source coding agent OpenCode. Simultaneously but separately, it has restricted usage of its AI models by rival labs including xAI (through the integrated developer environment Cursor) to train competing systems to Claude Code. The former action was clarified on Friday by Thariq Shihipar, a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic working on Claude Code. Writing on the social network X (formerly Twitter), Shihipar stated that the company had \"tightened our safeguards against spoofing the Claude Code harness.\"He acknowledged that the rollout had unintended collateral damage, noting that some user accounts were automatically banned for triggering abuse filters—an error the company is currently reversing. However, the blocking of the third-party integrations themselves appears to be intentional.The move targets harnesses—software wrappers that pilot a user’s web-based Claude account via OAuth to drive automated workflows. This effectively severs the link between flat-rate consumer Claude Pro/Max plans and external coding environments. The Harness ProblemA harness acts as a bridge between a subscription (designed for human chat) and an automated workflow. Tools like OpenCode work by spoofing the client identity, sending headers that convince the Anthropic server the request is coming from its own official command line interface (CLI) tool.Shihipar cited technical instability as the primary driver for the block, noting that unauthorized harnesses introduce bugs and usage patterns that Anthropic cannot properly diagnose. When a third-party wrapper like Cursor (in certain configurations) or OpenCode hits an error, users often blame the model, degrading trust in the platform.The Economic Tension: The Buffet AnalogyHowever, the developer community has pointed to a simpler economic reality underlying the restrictions on Cursor and similar tools: Cost.In extensive discussions on Hacker News beginning yesterday, users coalesced around a buffet analogy: Anthropic offers an all-you-can-eat buffet via its consumer subscription ($200/month for Max) but restricts the speed of consumption via its official tool, Claude Code.Third-party harnesses remove these speed limits. An autonomous agent running inside OpenCode can execute high-intensity loops—coding, testing, and fixing errors overnight—that would be cost-prohibitive on a metered plan.\"In a month of Claude Code, it&#x27;s easy to use so many LLM tokens that it would have cost you more than $1,000 if you&#x27;d paid via the API,\" noted Hacker News user dfabulich.By blocking these harnesses, Anthropic is forcing high-volume automation toward two sanctioned paths:The Commercial API: Metered, per-token pricing which captures the true cost of agentic loops.Claude Code: Anthropic’s managed environment, where they control the rate limits and execution sandbox.Community Pivot: Cat and MouseThe reaction from users has been swift and largely negative. \"Seems very customer hostile,\" wrote Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the creator of the popular Ruby on Rails open source web development framework, in a post on X. However, others were more sympathetic to Anthropic. \"anthropic crackdown on people abusing the subscription auth is the gentlest it could’ve been,\" wrote Artem K aka @banteg on X, a developer associated with Yearn Finance. \"just a polite message instead of nuking your account or retroactively charging you at api prices.\"The team behind OpenCode immediately launched OpenCode Black, a new premium tier for $200 per month that reportedly routes traffic through an enterprise API gateway to bypass the consumer OAuth restrictions.In addition, OpenCode creator Dax Raad posted on X saying that the company would be working with Anthropic rival OpenAI to allow users of its coding model and development agent, Codex, \"to benefit from their subscription directly within OpenCode,\" and then posted a GIF of the unforgettable scene from the 2000 film Gladiator showing Maximus (Russell Crowe) asking a crowd \"Are you not entertained?\" after chopping off an adversary&#x27;s head with two swords.For now, the message from Anthropic is clear: The ecosystem is consolidating. Whether via legal enforcement (as seen with xAI&#x27;s use of Cursor) or technical safeguards, the era of unrestricted access to Claude’s reasoning capabilities is coming to an end.The xAI Situation and Cursor ConnectionSimultaneous with the technical crackdown, developers at Elon Musk’s competing AI lab xAI have reportedly lost access to Anthropic’s Claude models. While the timing suggests a unified strategy, sources familiar with the matter indicate this is a separate enforcement action based on commercial terms, with Cursor playing a pivotal role in the discovery.As first reported by tech journalist Kylie Robison of the publication Core Memory, xAI staff had been using Anthropic models—specifically via the Cursor IDE—to accelerate their own developmet.\"Hi team, I believe many of you have already discovered that Anthropic models are not responding on Cursor,\" wrote xAI co-founder Tony Wu in a memo to staff on Wednesday, according to Robison. \"According to Cursor this is a new policy Anthropic is enforcing for all its major competitors.\"However, Section D.4 (Use Restrictions) of Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service expressly prohibits customers from using the services to:(a) access the Services to build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models... [or] (b) reverse engineer or duplicate the Services.In this instance, Cursor served as the vehicle for the violation. While the IDE itself is a legitimate tool, xAI&#x27;s specific use of it to leverage Claude for competitive research triggered the legal block.Precedent for the Block: The OpenAI and Windsurf CutoffsThe restriction on xAI is not the first time Anthropic has used its Terms of Service or infrastructure control to wall off a major competitor or third-party tool. This week’s actions follow a clear pattern established throughout 2025, where Anthropic aggressively moved to protect its intellectual property and computing resources.In August 2025, the company revoked OpenAI&#x27;s access to the Claude APIunder strikingly similar circumstances. Sources told Wired that OpenAI had been using Claude to benchmark its own models and test safety responses—a practice Anthropic flagged as a violation of its competitive restrictions.\"Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI&#x27;s own technical staff were also using our coding tools,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said at the time.Just months prior, in June 2025, the coding environment Windsurf faced a similar sudden blackout. In a public statement, the Windsurf team revealed that \"with less than a week of notice, Anthropic informed us they were cutting off nearly all of our first-party capacity\" for the Claude 3.x model family. The move forced Windsurf to immediately strip direct access for free users and pivot to a \"Bring-Your-Own-Key\" (BYOK) model while promoting Google’s Gemini as a stable alternative.While Windsurf eventually restored first-party access for paid users weeks later, the incident—combined with the OpenAI revocation and now the xAI block—reinforces a rigid boundary in the AI arms race: while labs and tools may coexist, Anthropic reserves the right to sever the connection the moment usage threatens its competitive advantage or business model.The Catalyst: The Viral Rise of &#x27;Claude Code&#x27;The timing of both crackdowns is inextricably linked to the massive surge in popularity for Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s native terminal environment.While Claude Code was originally released in early 2025, it spent much of the year as a niche utility. The true breakout moment arrived only in December 2025 and the first days of January 2026—driven less by official updates and more by the community-led \"Ralph Wiggum\" phenomenon.Named after the dim-witted Simpsons character, the Ralph Wiggum plugin popularized a method of \"brute force\" coding. By trapping Claude in a self-healing loop where failures are fed back into the context window until the code passes tests, developers achieved results that felt surprisingly close to AGI.But the current controversy isn&#x27;t over users losing access to the Claude Code interface—which many power users actually find limiting—but rather the underlying engine, the Claude Opus 4.5 model. By spoofing the official Claude Code client, tools like OpenCode allowed developers to harness Anthropic&#x27;s most powerful reasoning model for complex, autonomous loops at a flat subscription rate, effectively arbitraging the difference between consumer pricing and enterprise-grade intelligence.In fact, as developer Ed Andersen wrote on X, some of the popularity of Claude Code may have been driven by people spoofing it in this manner.Clearly, power users wanted to run it at massive scales without paying enterprise rates. Anthropic’s new enforcement actions are a direct attempt to funnel this runaway demand back into its sanctioned, sustainable channels.Enterprise Dev TakeawaysFor Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and scalability, this shift demands an immediate re-architecture of pipelines to prioritize stability over raw cost savings. While tools like OpenCode offered an attractive flat-rate alternative for heavy automation, Anthropic’s crackdown reveals that these unauthorized wrappers introduce undiagnosable bugs and instability. Ensuring model integrity now requires routing all automated agents through the official Commercial API or the Claude Code client. Therefore, enterprise decision makers should take note: even though open source solutions may be more affordable and more tempting, if they&#x27;re being used to access proprietary AI models like Anthropic&#x27;s, access is not always guaranteed.This transition necessitates a re-forecasting of operational budgets—moving from predictable monthly subscriptions to variable per-token billing—but ultimately trades financial predictability for the assurance of a supported, production-ready environment.From a security and compliance perspective, the simultaneous blocks on xAI and open-source tools expose the critical vulnerability of \"Shadow AI.\" When engineering teams use personal accounts or spoofed tokens to bypass enterprise controls, they risk not just technical debt but sudden, organization-wide access loss. Security directors must now audit internal toolchains to ensure that no \"dogfooding\" of competitor models violates commercial terms and that all automated workflows are authenticated via proper enterprise keys. In this new landscape, the reliability of the official API must trump the cost savings of unauthorized tools, as the operational risk of a total ban far outweighs the expense of proper integration.",

Tools like OpenCode work by spoofing the client identity, sending headers that convince the Anthropic server the request is coming from its own official command line interface (CLI) tool.Shihipar cited technical instability as the primary driver for the block, noting that unauthorized harnesses introduce bugs and usage patterns that Anthropic cannot properly diagnose. When a third-party wrapper like Cursor (in certain configurations) or OpenCode hits an error, users often blame the model, degrading trust in the platform.The Economic Tension: The Buffet AnalogyHowever, the developer community has pointed to a simpler economic reality underlying the restrictions on Cursor and similar tools: Cost.In extensive discussions on Hacker News beginning yesterday, users coalesced around a buffet analogy: Anthropic offers an all-you-can-eat buffet via its consumer subscription ($200/month for Max) but restricts the speed of consumption via its official tool, Claude Code.Third-party harnesses remove these speed limits. An autonomous agent running inside OpenCode can execute high-intensity loops—coding, testing, and fixing errors overnight—that would be cost-prohibitive on a metered plan.\"In a month of Claude Code, it&#x27;s easy to use so many LLM tokens that it would have cost you more than $1,000 if you&#x27;d paid via the API,\" noted Hacker News user dfabulich.By blocking these harnesses, Anthropic is forcing high-volume automation toward two sanctioned paths:The Commercial API: Metered, per-token pricing which captures the true cost of agentic loops.Claude Code: Anthropic’s managed environment, where they control the rate limits and execution sandbox.Community Pivot: Cat and MouseThe reaction from users has been swift and largely negative. \"Seems very customer hostile,\" wrote Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the creator of the popular Ruby on Rails open source web development framework, in a post on X. However, others were more sympathetic to Anthropic. \"anthropic crackdown on people abusing the subscription auth is the gentlest it could’ve been,\" wrote Artem K aka @banteg on X, a developer associated with Yearn Finance. \"just a polite message instead of nuking your account or retroactively charging you at api prices.\"The team behind OpenCode immediately launched OpenCode Black, a new premium tier for $200 per month that reportedly routes traffic through an enterprise API gateway to bypass the consumer OAuth restrictions.In addition, OpenCode creator Dax Raad posted on X saying that the company would be working with Anthropic rival OpenAI to allow users of its coding model and development agent, Codex, \"to benefit from their subscription directly within OpenCode,\" and then posted a GIF of the unforgettable scene from the 2000 film Gladiator showing Maximus (Russell Crowe) asking a crowd \"Are you not entertained?\" after chopping off an adversary&#x27;s head with two swords.For now, the message from Anthropic is clear: The ecosystem is consolidating. Whether via legal enforcement (as seen with xAI&#x27;s use of Cursor) or technical safeguards, the era of unrestricted access to Claude’s reasoning capabilities is coming to an end.The xAI Situation and Cursor ConnectionSimultaneous with the technical crackdown, developers at Elon Musk’s competing AI lab xAI have reportedly lost access to Anthropic’s Claude models. While the timing suggests a unified strategy, sources familiar with the matter indicate this is a separate enforcement action based on commercial terms, with Cursor playing a pivotal role in the discovery.As first reported by tech journalist Kylie Robison of the publication Core Memory, xAI staff had been using Anthropic models—specifically via the Cursor IDE—to accelerate their own developmet.\"Hi team, I believe many of you have already discovered that Anthropic models are not responding on Cursor,\" wrote xAI co-founder Tony Wu in a memo to staff on Wednesday, according to Robison. \"According to Cursor this is a new policy Anthropic is enforcing for all its major competitors.\"However, Section D.4 (Use Restrictions) of Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service expressly prohibits customers from using the services to:(a) access the Services to build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models... [or] (b) reverse engineer or duplicate the Services.In this instance, Cursor served as the vehicle for the violation. While the IDE itself is a legitimate tool, xAI&#x27;s specific use of it to leverage Claude for competitive research triggered the legal block.Precedent for the Block: The OpenAI and Windsurf CutoffsThe restriction on xAI is not the first time Anthropic has used its Terms of Service or infrastructure control to wall off a major competitor or third-party tool. This week’s actions follow a clear pattern established throughout 2025, where Anthropic aggressively moved to protect its intellectual property and computing resources.In August 2025, the company revoked OpenAI&#x27;s access to the Claude APIunder strikingly similar circumstances. Sources told Wired that OpenAI had been using Claude to benchmark its own models and test safety responses—a practice Anthropic flagged as a violation of its competitive restrictions.\"Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI&#x27;s own technical staff were also using our coding tools,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said at the time.Just months prior, in June 2025, the coding environment Windsurf faced a similar sudden blackout. In a public statement, the Windsurf team revealed that \"with less than a week of notice, Anthropic informed us they were cutting off nearly all of our first-party capacity\" for the Claude 3.x model family. The move forced Windsurf to immediately strip direct access for free users and pivot to a \"Bring-Your-Own-Key\" (BYOK) model while promoting Google’s Gemini as a stable alternative.While Windsurf eventually restored first-party access for paid users weeks later, the incident—combined with the OpenAI revocation and now the xAI block—reinforces a rigid boundary in the AI arms race: while labs and tools may coexist, Anthropic reserves the right to sever the connection the moment usage threatens its competitive advantage or business model.The Catalyst: The Viral Rise of &#x27;Claude Code&#x27;The timing of both crackdowns is inextricably linked to the massive surge in popularity for Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s native terminal environment.While Claude Code was originally released in early 2025, it spent much of the year as a niche utility. The true breakout moment arrived only in December 2025 and the first days of January 2026—driven less by official updates and more by the community-led \"Ralph Wiggum\" phenomenon.Named after the dim-witted Simpsons character, the Ralph Wiggum plugin popularized a method of \"brute force\" coding. By trapping Claude in a self-healing loop where failures are fed back into the context window until the code passes tests, developers achieved results that felt surprisingly close to AGI.But the current controversy isn&#x27;t over users losing access to the Claude Code interface—which many power users actually find limiting—but rather the underlying engine, the Claude Opus 4.5 model. By spoofing the official Claude Code client, tools like OpenCode allowed developers to harness Anthropic&#x27;s most powerful reasoning model for complex, autonomous loops at a flat subscription rate, effectively arbitraging the difference between consumer pricing and enterprise-grade intelligence.In fact, as developer Ed Andersen wrote on X, some of the popularity of Claude Code may have been driven by people spoofing it in this manner.Clearly, power users wanted to run it at massive scales without paying enterprise rates. Anthropic’s new enforcement actions are a direct attempt to funnel this runaway demand back into its sanctioned, sustainable channels.Enterprise Dev TakeawaysFor Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and scalability, this shift demands an immediate re-architecture of pipelines to prioritize stability over raw cost savings. While tools like OpenCode offered an attractive flat-rate alternative for heavy automation, Anthropic’s crackdown reveals that these unauthorized wrappers introduce undiagnosable bugs and instability. Ensuring model integrity now requires routing all automated agents through the official Commercial API or the Claude Code client. Therefore, enterprise decision makers should take note: even though open source solutions may be more affordable and more tempting, if they&#x27;re being used to access proprietary AI models like Anthropic&#x27;s, access is not always guaranteed.This transition necessitates a re-forecasting of operational budgets—moving from predictable monthly subscriptions to variable per-token billing—but ultimately trades financial predictability for the assurance of a supported, production-ready environment.From a security and compliance perspective, the simultaneous blocks on xAI and open-source tools expose the critical vulnerability of \"Shadow AI.\" When engineering teams use personal accounts or spoofed tokens to bypass enterprise controls, they risk not just technical debt but sudden, organization-wide access loss. Security directors must now audit internal toolchains to ensure that no \"dogfooding\" of competitor models violates commercial terms and that all automated workflows are authenticated via proper enterprise keys. In this new landscape, the reliability of the official API must trump the cost savings of unauthorized tools, as the operational risk of a total ban far outweighs the expense of proper integration.",

As Engadget’s editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris put it, “Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product.” Regardless of trends, Lego has always persisted. And in 2026, it’s getting much smarter. Lego The system consists of a Smart Brick, Tags and Minifigures. They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips. It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on right here), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing. Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human.

As Engadget’s editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris put it, “Lego could almost be seen as the antithesis of the typical CES product.” Regardless of trends, Lego has always persisted. And in 2026, it’s getting much smarter. Lego The system consists of a Smart Brick, Tags and Minifigures. They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips. It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on right here), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing. Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70. We'll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

Engadget On Monday, which feels like an age ago, Jensen Huang shared the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations. The centerpiece is Alpamayo 1, a 10-billion-parameter chain-of-thought system NVIDIA says can drive more like a human. When it comes to tech we all might use, we had to wait for a separate event, when NVIDIA announced DLSS 4.5 and G-Sync Pulsar. For both features, you’ll need a 50-series GPU. You got one, right?

          "standfirst": "Enterprise security teams are losing ground to AI-enabled attacks — not because defenses are weak, but because the threat model has shifted. As AI agents move into production, attackers are exploiting runtime weaknesses where breakout times are measured in seconds, patch windows in hours, and traditional security has little visibility or control.CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report documents breakout times as fast as 51 seconds. Attackers are moving from initial access to lateral movement before most security teams get their first alert. The same report found 79% of detections were malware-free, with adversaries using hands-on keyboard techniques that bypass traditional endpoint defenses entirely.CISOs’ latest challenge is not getting reverse-engineered in 72 hoursMike Riemer, field CISO at Ivanti, has watched AI collapse the window between patch release and weaponization.\"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches within 72 hours,\" Riemer told VentureBeat. \"If a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of release, they&#x27;re open to exploit. The speed has been enhanced greatly by AI.\"Most enterprises take weeks or months to manually patch, with firefighting and other urgent priorities often taking precedence. Why traditional security is failing at runtimeAn SQL injection typically has a recognizable signature. Security teams are improving their tradecraft, and many are blocking them with near-zero false positives. But \"ignore previous instructions\" carries payload potential equivalent to a buffer overflow while sharing nothing with known malware. The attack is semantic, not syntactic. Prompt injections are taking adversarial tradecraft and weaponized AI to a new level of threat through semantics that cloak injection attempts.Gartner&#x27;s research puts it bluntly: \"Businesses will embrace generative AI, regardless of security.\" The firm found 89% of business technologists would bypass cybersecurity guidance to meet a business objective. Shadow AI isn&#x27;t a risk — it&#x27;s a certainty.\"Threat actors using AI as an attack vector has been accelerated, and they are so far in front of us as defenders,\" Riemer told VentureBeat. \"We need to get on a bandwagon as defenders to start utilizing AI; not just in deepfake detection, but in identity management. How can I use AI to determine if what&#x27;s coming at me is real?\"Carter Rees, VP of AI at Reputation, frames the technical gap: \"Defense-in-depth strategies predicated on deterministic rules and static signatures are fundamentally insufficient against the stochastic, semantic nature of attacks targeting AI models at runtime.\"11 attack vectors that bypass every traditional security controlThe OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 ranks prompt injection first. But that’s one of eleven vectors security leaders and AI builders must address. Each requires understanding both attack mechanics and defensive countermeasures.1. Direct prompt injection: Models trained to follow instructions will prioritize user commands over safety training. Pillar Security&#x27;s State of Attacks on GenAI report found 20% of jailbreaks succeed in an average of 42 seconds, with 90% of successful attacks leaking sensitive data. Defense: Intent classification that recognizes jailbreak patterns before prompts reach the model, plus output filtering that catches successful bypasses.2. Camouflage attacks: Attackers exploit the model&#x27;s tendency to follow contextual cues by embedding harmful requests inside benign conversations. Palo Alto Unit 42&#x27;s \"Deceptive Delight\" research achieved 65% success across 8,000 tests on eight different models in just three interaction turns. Defense: Context-aware analysis evaluating cumulative intent across a conversation, not individual messages.3. Multi-turn crescendo attacks: Distributing payloads across turns that each appear benign in isolation defeats single-turn protections. The automated Crescendomation tool achieved 98% success on GPT-4 and 100% on Gemini-Pro. Defense: Stateful context tracking, maintaining conversation history, and flagging escalation patterns.4. Indirect prompt injection (RAG poisoning): A zero-click exploit targeting RAG architectures, this is an attack strategy providing especially difficult to stop. PoisonedRAG research achieves 90% attack success by injecting just five malicious texts into databases containing millions of documents. Defense: Wrap retrieved data in delimiters, instructing the model to treat content as data only. Strip control tokens from vector database chunks before they enter the context window.5. Obfuscation attacks: Malicious instructions encoded using ASCII art, Base64, or Unicode bypass keyword filters while remaining interpretable to the model. ArtPrompt research achieved up to 76.2% success across GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2 in evaluating how lethal this type of attack is. Defense: Normalization layers decode all non-standard representations to plain text before semantic analysis. This single step blocks most encoding-based attacks.6. Model extraction: Systematic API queries reconstruct proprietary capabilities via distillation. Model Leeching research extracted 73% similarity from ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo for $50 in API costs over 48 hours.Defense: Behavioral fingerprinting, detecting distribution analysis patterns, watermarking proving theft post-facto, and rate limiting, analyzing query patterns beyond simple request counts.7. Resource exhaustion (sponge attacks). Crafted inputs exploit Transformer attention&#x27;s quadratic complexity, exhausting inference budgets or degrading service. IEEE EuroS&P research on sponge examples demonstrated 30× latency increases on language models. One attack pushed Microsoft Azure Translator from 1ms to 6 seconds. A 6,000× degradation. Defense: Token budgeting per user, prompt complexity analysis rejecting recursive patterns, and semantic caching serving repeated heavy prompts without incurring inference costs.8. Synthetic identity fraud. AI-generated personas combining real and fabricated data to bypass identity verification is one of retailing and financial services’ greatest AI-generated risks. The Federal Reserve&#x27;s research on synthetic identity fraud notes 85-95% of synthetic applicants evade traditional fraud models. Signicat&#x27;s 2024 report found AI-driven fraud now constitutes 42.5% of all detected fraud attempts in the financial sector. Defense: Multi-factor verification incorporating behavioral signals beyond static identity attributes, plus anomaly detection trained on synthetic identity patterns.9. Deepfake-enabled fraud. AI-generated audio and video impersonate executives to authorize transactions, often attempting to defraud organizations. Onfido&#x27;s 2024 Identity Fraud Report documented a 3,000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023. Arup lost $25 million through a single video call with AI-generated participants impersonating the CFO and colleagues. Defense: Out-of-band verification for high-value transactions, liveness detection for video authentication, and policies requiring secondary confirmation regardless of apparent seniority.10. Data exfiltration via negligent insiders. Employees paste proprietary code and strategy documents into public LLMs. That is exactly what Samsung engineers did within weeks of lifting their ChatGPT ban, leaking source code and internal meeting notes in three separate incidents. Gartner predicts 80% of unauthorized AI transactions through 2026 will stem from internal policy violations rather than malicious attacks. Defense: Personally identifiable information (PII) redaction allows safe AI tool usage while preventing sensitive data from reaching external models. Make secure usage the path of least resistance.11. Hallucination exploitation. Counterfactual prompting forces models to agree with fabrications, amplifying false outputs. Research on LLM-based agents shows that hallucinations accumulate and amplify over multi-step processes. This becomes dangerous when AI outputs feed automated workflows without human review. Defense: Grounding modules compare responses against retrieved context for faithfulness, plus confidence scoring, flagging potential hallucinations before propagation.What CISOs need to do now Gartner predicts 25% of enterprise breaches will trace to AI agent abuse by 2028. The window to build defenses is now.Chris Betz, CISO at AWS, framed it at RSA 2024: \"Companies forget about the security of the application in their rush to use generative AI. The places where we&#x27;re seeing the security gaps first are actually at the application layer. People are racing to get solutions out, and they are making mistakes.\"Five deployment priorities emerge:Automate patch deployment.

That&#x27;s zero trust; not as a buzzword, but as an operational principle.\"Microsoft&#x27;s exposure went undetected for three years. Samsung leaked code for weeks.

          "title": "CES: So very big, so little sustainability tech",
          "standfirst": "Every third booth at CES showed off some new AI product or other. If you wanted to find a robotic lawn mower, throw a rock. Humanoid robots, smart locks and super thin TVs were everywhere. But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the multitude of problems the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s best of CES status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas. And gosh darn it, at least these guys are trying. Shine Turbine 2.0Spinning the Shine 2.0 wind turbineAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThis little guy could be a precursor to some serious personal wind power generation. That’s where the company is heading. For now, the Shine 2.0 can use as little as a light breeze to start generating power to charge your smartphones, laptops or even a power station. The whole unit weighs three pounds and sets up in around two minutes. The second generation model can output up to 75 watts and the company is working on a third version that goes up to 100 watts for even more substantial energy production. Learn more at Shine. Flint battery techFlint batteries break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a compost pile. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetWhen I approached Flint’s booth, the rep told me the company made cellulose batteries. And I thought, like paper-wrapped batteries? Nope. The chemicals inside the batteries are made from cellulose. They have a solvent-free, lithium-free, PFAS-free chemistry and break down by 70 percent in four weeks in a composting environment. They use the same basic architecture as a lithium-ion cell, with an anode, cathode and separator with ion transfers between the two. As of now, Flint is focused on partnering with manufacturers, and consumer products are on the horizon. Learn more at Flint. Clear Drop soft plastics compactorThe Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces.Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThe Clear Drop is a soft plastics compactor that creates eight by twelve by four-inch bricks out of hundreds of grocery bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks and plastic packaging. One brick is equivalent to a 30-pound trash bag-worth of bags. Once the brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities in a pre-paid USPS shipping envelope. They currently work with a few US-based recycling facilities and hope to one day create an infrastructure to include municipal recycling.Learn more at Clear Drop. Alpha Power by CPTIAlpha power by CPTIAmy Skorheim for EngadgetFrom what I’ve learned at the show, perovskite is the hottest thing in solar right now. It’s a mineral compound that’s been used to create more efficient solar panels. Some so sensitive to light that just indoor illumination is enough to create usable energy. Alpha Power by CPTI creates lightweight, flexible perovskite solar panels that can conform to multiple surfaces. Again, this is a company that’s partnering with manufacturers, so look for panels built into your laptop to charge it under the glare of your too-harsh office lights. Learn more at CPTI. Green Vigor 3D models of buildings using Green Vigor technology. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetDown in the lower levels of the Venetian Expo at CES I found Green Vigor in the Hong Kong pavilion. This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. Learn more at GreenVigor. Jackery Solar GazeboJackery's Solar Gazebo. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThis outdoor hangout spot can produce up to 10kWh of power on a given day. It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. Learn more at Jackery. Bluetti RV Solar SystemBluetti's DIY RV Solar power systemAmy Skorheim for EngadgetBluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries. This year, it brought a new power station made with bio-based plastic as well as a DIY system for adding solar power to your existing RV. Learn more at Bluetti. Airloom wind power generationAirloom's roller coaster-like wind power generator for data centers. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetEngadget’s Anna Washenko does a great job of explaining the tech behind Airloom. In short it’s a roller coaster for wind that’s comprised of 40 percent less mass than a standard wind turbine and uses 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. That makes it faster to deploy and cheaper to instal. I can also be sited in more places. Again, this is a utility-scale solution, geared towards data centers and their insatiable need for energy to power Very Important AI Things. Learn more at Airloom.Gaotu Innovation Energy GroupGaotu had a range of solar products in various formats. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetIf you are looking for a solar-powered anything, hit up Gaotu. At the company’s booth, I saw hats, a fishing chair, a backpack, a sunbrella and a car roof-top enclosure that unfurls to charge up your Tesla. The Shenzhen-based company has been in business for 18 years and plans to just keep sticking solar panels on anything it can. Learn more at Gaotu. Segway Muxi cargo e-bikeSegway's latest cargo e-bikeAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThe single largest booth in the CES sustainability section was Segway. This year, the company showed off two new e-bikes, which our own Dan Cooper covered. This one here is the Muxi, a cargo bike with an easily swappable battery, an optional passenger seat with foot pegs and an optional middle basket. Plus a beverage cup holder. Learn more at Segway. If we don’t all fall into the ocean before then, perhaps CES 2027 will have a stronger showing of sustainability tech. In the meantime, I’ll take a modicum of comfort in these few brave organizations still dedicated to keeping us afloat.

Clear Drop soft plastics compactorThe Clear Drop soft plastics compactor next to a pile of the bricks it produces.Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThe Clear Drop is a soft plastics compactor that creates eight by twelve by four-inch bricks out of hundreds of grocery bags, bubble wrap, ziplocks and plastic packaging. One brick is equivalent to a 30-pound trash bag-worth of bags. Once the brick is created, it can be shipped to one of Clear Drop’s partner facilities in a pre-paid USPS shipping envelope. They currently work with a few US-based recycling facilities and hope to one day create an infrastructure to include municipal recycling.Learn more at Clear Drop. Alpha Power by CPTIAlpha power by CPTIAmy Skorheim for EngadgetFrom what I’ve learned at the show, perovskite is the hottest thing in solar right now. It’s a mineral compound that’s been used to create more efficient solar panels. Some so sensitive to light that just indoor illumination is enough to create usable energy. Alpha Power by CPTI creates lightweight, flexible perovskite solar panels that can conform to multiple surfaces. Again, this is a company that’s partnering with manufacturers, so look for panels built into your laptop to charge it under the glare of your too-harsh office lights. Learn more at CPTI. Green Vigor 3D models of buildings using Green Vigor technology. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetDown in the lower levels of the Venetian Expo at CES I found Green Vigor in the Hong Kong pavilion. This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems. HydroVigor is currently in use in many buildings in Singapore and Hong Kong and they’re working to expand to more buildings globally. Learn more at GreenVigor. Jackery Solar GazeboJackery's Solar Gazebo. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetThis outdoor hangout spot can produce up to 10kWh of power on a given day. It’s a modular design that lets you choose louvered walls, sunshades, lights and fans when you order it and the solar panels are so strong that a full-sized human Jackery rep was able to stand on a sample panel in front of me and nothing cracked (though the company officially rates it at 20 pounds of snow per square foot). You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. Learn more at Jackery. Bluetti RV Solar SystemBluetti's DIY RV Solar power systemAmy Skorheim for EngadgetBluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries. This year, it brought a new power station made with bio-based plastic as well as a DIY system for adding solar power to your existing RV. Learn more at Bluetti. Airloom wind power generationAirloom's roller coaster-like wind power generator for data centers. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetEngadget’s Anna Washenko does a great job of explaining the tech behind Airloom. In short it’s a roller coaster for wind that’s comprised of 40 percent less mass than a standard wind turbine and uses 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. That makes it faster to deploy and cheaper to instal. I can also be sited in more places. Again, this is a utility-scale solution, geared towards data centers and their insatiable need for energy to power Very Important AI Things. Learn more at Airloom.Gaotu Innovation Energy GroupGaotu had a range of solar products in various formats. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetIf you are looking for a solar-powered anything, hit up Gaotu. At the company’s booth, I saw hats, a fishing chair, a backpack, a sunbrella and a car roof-top enclosure that unfurls to charge up your Tesla. The Shenzhen-based company has been in business for 18 years and plans to just keep sticking solar panels on anything it can. Learn more at Gaotu. Segway Muxi cargo e-bikeSegway's latest cargo e-bikeAmy Skorheim for EngadgetThe single largest booth in the CES sustainability section was Segway. This year, the company showed off two new e-bikes, which our own Dan Cooper covered. This one here is the Muxi, a cargo bike with an easily swappable battery, an optional passenger seat with foot pegs and an optional middle basket. Plus a beverage cup holder. Learn more at Segway. If we don’t all fall into the ocean before then, perhaps CES 2027 will have a stronger showing of sustainability tech. In the meantime, I’ll take a modicum of comfort in these few brave organizations still dedicated to keeping us afloat.

          "standfirst": "Dell's XPS 14 now costs over $2,000. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung's marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, told Bloomberg at CES: \"There's going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it's going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.\"Dell's new XPS 14 and XPS 16 are among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year's models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. But Dell later announced a shocking price jump: The XPS 14 now starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. While it didn't take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000, it's genuinely wild to me that the entry-level models are already starting there. And meanwhile, Apple still hasn't budged its $1,599 MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.On the desktop front, AMD's David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company's AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.\"I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,\" he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. \"Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there's a pretty big boost there.\"McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD's business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.\"There's no product that has memory in it that's immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it's doing to the market,\" he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. \"I think the, the truth is the volatility that we've seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.\" Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn't discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD's X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don't see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new Vera Rubin AI supercomputer, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its new Helios AI rack, which supports up to 31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.

          "standfirst": "Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that feels charmingly out-of-place in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab. That was obviously two years ago when the company first revealed its keyboard case that brought tactile typing to the iPhone and eventually other Android devices. Rather than that being a one-off curiosity, the company had two new announcements at CES 2026: a magnetic keyboard accessory that also doubles as a battery bank and small, squat mobile phone with a keyboard. And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetThe Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetAs someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. “You've got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you've got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there's a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You've got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you've got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetThe other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn't your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of the Niagara Android launcher, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we've optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it's not the thing you're going to reach for to do that. But we're not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience.

          "standfirst": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is upon us. All manner of companies descended on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew were on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we kept tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, LG showed off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There was some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some weird tech.You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either. Some are available to buy right now. You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We also had CES live updates with all the latest news from the event. Be sure to check out Engadget’s best of CES 2026 as well, in which we highlighted 15 winners across several categories, and named our best in show honoree.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and the imperial march.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGAlong with some TVs (which we’ll get to momentarily), LG brought plenty of other products to CES. For one thing, the company shone a spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon. During an in-person CES demo, Engadget senior reporter Karissa Bell saw CLOiD competently pull off some household tasks, albeit very slowly.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was largely a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some fresh news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios (self-driving car tech, in other words). The company also revealed that a supercomputer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture which it first unveiled in 2024 is now in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel in recent times, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it steady the ship. These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says these chips offer improvements to performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased an Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. This isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the previous iteration.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for more detailed specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint with the ROG Zephyrus Duo. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Lenovo, meanwhile, showed off a concept laptop with an expandable, rollable screen. You really need to see this thing in action.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetAs ever, TVs were front and center at CES. Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We saw more of these TVs at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that arena with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the latest Fire TV OS will be up to 30 percent faster. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates. Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too. Belkin, meanwhile, has a new wireless HDMI dongle that doesn't require a Wi-Fi connection. That should make it easy to beam videos from a device with a USB-C port to a TV, monitor or projector — handy if you’re planning an outdoor movie night in a space with spotty internet access.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first such model on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature, in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and have a dedicated section of the display for each. That could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that setup. You can control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors just ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES, though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over the previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for summer camping trips, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the lead up to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those as well). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. The First Look event has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to help you do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's at the prototype stage and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It has sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the bulkiness and the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea). However, after Sam opened up the Galaxy Z TriFold, his “concerns were quickly pushed aside” by “10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate may come in handy for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on story for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll learn the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then there’s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there was a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere were a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic ($399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle appSubtleAs for Subtle’s Voicebuds, those are said to be capable of picking up audio below the sound of a whisper, so you can very quietly dictate information to them and an AI model will transcribe what you can say. You can use the $199 voicebuds as regular earbuds too for making calls and listening to audio. However, you’ll need to fork over $17 a month for access to features like instant dictation and the option to transcribe notes without having to look at your phone (internet access is required to use Subtle’s best transcription models too). If you opt not to subscribe, the Voicebuds will use a smaller local model for transcription.On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that can draft an email when you mention that you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.Switchbot's Onero H1.Karissa Bell for EngadgetLG’s CLOiD is still a concept helper robot for now, but the Onero H1 is one you may be able to buy as soon as this year. During an in-person demo, we saw Switchbot’s Onero H1 robot (slowly) pick up clothes, chuck them in a washing machine and close the door. The company has also released a video that shows the Onero H1 carrying out other household tasks, from serving food and drinks to washing windows. We’re told Switchbot plans to sell the robot for \"less than $10,000.\"Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.Then there’s OlloBot, a companion robot with an optional extendable, fuzzy neck that’s warm to the touch. OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break. The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too. The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit. Adorable!TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony Honda Mobility plans to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona. However, after getting a close-up look at the latest iteration of the EV, Engadget contributor Tim Stevens reckons the Afeela 1 feels “more and more out of touch” with each passing year, even though it “was an audacious product when it was announced at CES 2020.”We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.Longbow Motors SpeedsterTim Stevens for EngadgetLongbow Motors announced a pair of lightweight EVs that have a curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. The Speedster and Roadster boast advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs, a Verge Motorcycles spinoff. Longbow brought the Speedster to CES and the EV looks quite fetching. The vehicles will be pricey, though. Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, and that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi looks quite pretty and it has a cup holder (love that), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year, even though I don’t think I’d actually use it very much. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. There are also several emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. As noted in our live blog, Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith had a chance to try out the FlipPad. We also saw a new Xbox controller from 8BitDo that has swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller — partly because I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk. So, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. The side panel can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio. There’s also an AI desktop companion device with several avatars to choose from, including an anime girl and legendary League of Legends player Faker.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while (largely due to the Sonos integration), and the Soundstage speaker — available this summer for $350 — is tempting too. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer but there’s no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model as well as on the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victrola and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds — which have Dolby Atmos support — and Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the outside of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now. Still, the audio quality is “excellent,” as Billy wrote in his hands-on story. Smart homeDreame Cyber X robot vacuumEngadgetAs ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a robot vacuum concept from Dreame. It's one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.Narwhal built a new vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a \"PetCare Mode\" you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you're not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both of these products should be available in the spring.Anker's Eufy brand has a new robot vacuum too, along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. This one’s pretty interesting: Lockin’s latest vein-recognition smart lock can wirelessly recharge via an optical infrared beam emitted by a separate device that’s plugged into an outlet.On a similar note, Ring has updated its door, window and break glass sensors, and it has introduced an OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. Most of those will be available in March, though you can pre-order the car alarm now.Elsewhere in home security, Ugreen announced a modular system that, refreshingly, does not require a subscription. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim checked out the products and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA's lamps and other devices.Amy also went hands-on (well, voice-on) with some pretty interesting devices from Emerson Smart. The company’s on-device voice command tech means that you can control its smart plugs, fans, heaters and air fryers without a Wi-Fi connection or having to set things up through an app.Philips Hue SpatialAware featureSpeaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES. You'll need a Hue Bridge Pro to use the SpatialAware feature, which uses augmented reality to make sure all of the lights in a room are working together harmoniously to create, for instance, a more natural-looking sunset scene. Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring. Also on the way is Apple Home support for the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors.Elsewhere in lighting, Govee has a new floor lamp, as well as a ceiling light that's said to simulate a skylight.GE Profile Smart Fridge on display at CES Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn terms of kitchen tech, GE Appliances has a new smart refrigerator that's designed to make restocking easier. It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It's possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There's also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge's crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899. Check out Amy’s hands-on story for our initial impressions.NoshDaniel Cooper for EngadgetNosh, meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you'll be able to buy in the next few months. Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh's repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you'll still need to prep fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you're ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the T1 leaf blower (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September. Meanwhile, Segway’s Navimow unit has a bunch of new robot mowers. Health and accessibilityImage of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that a toilet computer made an appearance in our roundup of weird CES tech. But if I’ve learned anything from watching Scrubs, it’s that our waste offers up a lot of revealing information about our health, so Throne is a pretty compelling device. It has a camera and microphone to track your bowel movements and urination levels. The idea is to figure out your regular toilet usage and then flag any deviations from that. The creators hope that Throne will help you gain a better understanding of your gut health, which could be beneficial for those on GLP-1 drugs or who have gastrointestinal conditions. Throne will start shipping in February for $340 and a $6 per month subscription.Image of Vivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo also showed off a toilet device that can monitor your urination levels. Not only that, the company unveiled a smart menstrual pad. The idea is for for wearers to scan the pad with their phone camera after use.Elsewhere, the latest version of Withing’s Body Scan scale can track 60 biomarkers, up from the 40 the first model;s 40. The Body Scan 2 should be available in the spring for $600.Image of the Eyebot KioskDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOne other health-focused product we found interesting was the Eyebot vision test booth. This kiosk aims to speed up the eye exam process with a test that takes just a couple of minutes. A licensed eye doctor who works remotely will take a look at Eyebot’s findings before signing off on a prescription. The kiosk can’t run medical tests, such as the brief blast of air that eye doctors use to assess the risk of glaucoma. But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the groundCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAccessibility tech is a welcome presence at CES, and WheelMove looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users. It’s a device with a large front wheel that can quickly be attached to any manual wheelchair. It can then raise the wheelchair’s smaller front wheels off the ground, primarily to help users navigate rough terrain. The $6,000 WheelMove will debut in France later their year before a broader rollout.ReviMo has built a robotic lift that it says can help people move themselves from (for instance) a bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a caregiver. The company expects Niko to cost around $15,000, but it’s attempting to get the device covered by insurance.Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as \"bionic footwear.\"Karissa Bell for EngadgetDephy’s Sidekick is designed as a walking aid. It’s an ankle-worn exoskeleton that hooks into a sneaker. The Sidekick has sensors that can detect the user’s gait and adapt to it in order to deliver an effective boost in each step. At $4,500, the Sidekick isn’t cheap, but it could be a boon for those who are perhaps not as physically active as they’d like to be. Dephy is also adapting the tech for athletic use — the company is working with Nike on a robotic sneaker project.WearablesPebble Round 2Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs ever, there were lots of wearables at CES. Pebble successor Core Devices was there with a followup to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted just over a decade ago. The circular ​​Pebble Round 2 has a far thinner bezel than its predecessor, a 1.3-inch color e-paper display and a promised battery life of over two weeks. The latest model from the revived smartwatch brand is coming your way in May for $199, and we've had a chance to try it out.Three Pebble Indexes side by side on a table.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThere's also a Pebble smart ring called the Index 01. It has a button that you can press to talk to Pebble's Claude-powered AI when there's something you want to remember. Engadget managing editor Cherlynn Low had a chance to pop one on at CES, and reckoned that Pebble and Core Devices founder Eric Migicovsky and his team might \"have the right approach to making an AI ring.\"You can pre-order the Index 01 now for $75. Once it starts shipping in March, the price will jump up to $99.Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThere was some intriguing news on the wristband front, particularly in terms of the Meta ecosystem. The company demoed a way to use its EMG wristband (which comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses) to control other devices, such as a car's infotainment system.On top of that, a startup called Hapware has made a haptic wristband that works with the computer vision functions of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. It's said to be capable of understanding the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of people you're chatting with, which could be beneficial for folks who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent. The Alaye wristband starts at $359. You can pay $637 for a version that includes a one-year subscription. Otherwise, Hapware's required plan costs $29 per month.Smart glasses were present at CES as well. Xreal gave its entry-level One cinema glasses a spec bump and a new name. The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99. Like the Xreal 1S, it’s available now.The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetASUS and Xreal teamed up to make the gaming-focused ROG Xreal R1 smart glasses. They have 1080p displays with a 240Hz refresh rate. An included control dock has two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4 port, making it a cinch to hook up and switch between console, handhelds and PC inputs. ASUS and Xreal have yet to announce a release date or pricing.Projector maker XGIMI also debuted its first smart glasses at CES, while Lumus demoed models with 30-degree and 70-degree fields of view. IXI had something compelling to show off too: a pair of glasses that can automatically focus on what you're looking at. The company is hoping to release a consumer version this year, Other things that caught our eyeThis roundup is pretty darn exhaustive (if I do say so myself), but there's still so much more that grabbed our attention at CES. Much of that tech perhaps doesn't quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let's jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:HP revived an old trend by stuffing a computer inside a keyboard.We've long liked Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand's first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.Yukai Engineering's Baby FuFu is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.Anker's Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The Bottle Washer S1 also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.Clear Drop can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don't accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It's a compelling idea, even if the company's device costs $1,400.It's always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. Birdbuddy showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026. Thanks for sticking with us this week!This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/all-the-tech-and-gadgets-announced-at-ces-2026-130124023.html?src=rss",
          "content": "It's the first week of a new year and there's no time for the tech world to slowly ease back into things following the holidays. That's because CES 2026 is upon us. All manner of companies descended on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future. Many of the Engadget crew were on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we kept tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, LG showed off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There was some hot gaming gear at the show too, not to mention some weird tech.You don’t necessarily have to wait to get your hands on all of these gadgets either. Some are available to buy right now. You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We also had CES live updates with all the latest news from the event. Be sure to check out Engadget’s best of CES 2026 as well, in which we highlighted 15 winners across several categories, and named our best in show honoree.LegoLego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.LegoIn its first CES appearance, Lego announced the Smart Brick, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. The first “Smart Play” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel & A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and the imperial march.Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.LGLG's CLOiD robot.LGAlong with some TVs (which we’ll get to momentarily), LG brought plenty of other products to CES. For one thing, the company shone a spotlight on its CLOiD robot. Like the far creepier-looking 1X Neo, the CLOiD is designed to help with household tasks such as starting laundry cycles, folding clothes, unloading the dishwasher and serving food. This appears to be more of a concept than something you'll be able to buy anytime soon. During an in-person CES demo, Engadget senior reporter Karissa Bell saw CLOiD competently pull off some household tasks, albeit very slowly.The company also debuted the LG Sound Suite, a modular home audio system it developed in conjunction with Dolby to take on the likes of Sonos. Just ahead of CES, LG pulled back the curtain on a new batch of xboom speakers as well as some monitors and ultralight Gram laptops that are made with a material it's calling Aerominum. The chipmakersNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang presents at CES 2026, wearing a black snakeskin-like jacket.NVIDIAIt's CES, so of course we're going to see a bunch of laptops and desktops, along with announcements about the tech that powers the new models. That means NVIDIA, Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were all in town to talk up their latest chips and other innovations.Given its lofty position in the industry (and the economy) NVIDIA’s CES press conference is always one to keep an eye on. This year’s edition was largely a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have some fresh news to share.NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios (self-driving car tech, in other words). The company also revealed that a supercomputer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture which it first unveiled in 2024 is now in production. As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable. He may have a better case than OpenAI does right now.Sam Chapman for EngadgetThings haven’t exactly been going great for Intel in recent times, but the company is surely hoping that its Core Ultra Series 3 chips can help it steady the ship. These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says these chips offer improvements to performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life for laptops. The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased an Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some Battlefield 6 on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and came away impressed. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU. That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.AMDOf course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party. The company announced several CPUs for laptops and desktops, while chillingly declaring that “AI is everywhere” and “changing the face of gaming.” Ick. There was a lot of AI chat during the two-hour(!) keynote, along with a “a jet-powered flying robot.” Illustration showing the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus on a stylized red circuit board showing the abbreviation \"X2.\"QualcommAnd then there’s Qualcomm. The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. This isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the previous iteration.Laptops Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-onMat Smith for EngadgetWhat would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips? As ever, laptop and desktop makers were at the show to offer up their latest models for your consideration. (Be sure to check out our dedicated roundup of all the laptops that grabbed our attention at this year’s show.)Samsung’s Galaxy Book 6 Ultra, Galaxy Book 6 Pro and Galaxy Book 6 boast Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 chips and revamped designs that are said to improve heat management. You can read our story on the Galaxy Book 6 series for more detailed specs of these laptops, though we don’t have pricing or a release window as yet.Dell realized it messed up by killing off the XPS name as part of a broader rebranding effort and we’re glad to see that the company is making a U-turn on that front. A full lineup of XPS laptops is coming this year, including an all-new XPS 13 (a long-time Engadget fave on the Windows ultraportable front). Dell also has 14- and 16-inch XPS models in the hopper, along with others it’s keeping under wraps for now.On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.We love an odd laptop and ASUS didn’t disappoint with the ROG Zephyrus Duo. This is a dual-screen gaming laptop with two 16-inch OLED panels, one of Intel’s new CPUs and up to an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU. The keyboard is detachable and can work wirelessly. A kickstand can help you set up the Zephyrus Duo in all kinds of orientations. You can even position the dual screens in an upside-down “V” tent mode. We don’t know the price of the Zephyrus Duo as yet, but it surely won’t be inexpensive.Marketing photo of a Kojima-inspired ROG Flow Z13 tabletASUSThat’s not all ASUS brought to the dance. The company made a special edition of the ROG Flow Z13 some that’s styled after the works of the famed game designer Hideo Kojima. The ROG Flow Z13-KJP has visual flair that’s draws from the likes of Death Stranding and Metal Gear. Kojima’s Ludens mascot is here too. There’s no pricing or release date for this variant or its matching accessories just yet.Lenovo, meanwhile, showed off a concept laptop with an expandable, rollable screen. You really need to see this thing in action.Micro RGB TVs Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetAs ever, TVs were front and center at CES. Micro RGB is a term you can expect to hear about quite a bit in the coming months and years, especially when you're shopping for your next TV. Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones. Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.We saw more of these TVs at CES 2026, including a mammoth 130-inch concept model that Samsung brought to Las Vegas. The company unveiled its first Micro RGB TV in August — that’s a 115-inch, $29,999 model. This year, you can expect it to start offering Micro RGB TVs in 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. There are also 85-, 100- and 115-inch models on the way.LG revealed its first Micro RGB set at CES as well. The largest variant is 100 inches, but there are 86- and 75-inch models too. Elsewhere, LG showed off its latest Wallpaper TV, which is a 100-inch OLED display. We also got a look at LG's new Gallery TV — The Gallery is the company's take on Samsung's Frame TV format.Other new TVs and OS updatesEmber Artline TV.AmazonWe’ve got another competitor to The Frame, as Amazon has entered that arena with the Ember Artline TV. The 4K OLED model has Amazon Photos integration and you can choose from 2,000 pieces of free art to show on the screen. The Ember Artline can switch on or off automatically when someone enters or leaves the room. It runs on the Fire TV platform and (of course) there’s Alexa+ integration, along with support for Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and Wi-Fi 6. The Ember Artline is expected to start shipping this spring. It starts at $899 for the 55-inch model.The rounder redesigned Fire TV UI.AmazonSpeaking of Fire TV, Amazon has revamped the platform’s user interface with rounded corners for show, movie and app tiles; a little more space for said tiles; and typography and color gradient changes. The company has reworked the platform’s codebase as well, and it says the latest Fire TV OS will be up to 30 percent faster. Amazon will start rolling out the updated UI next month.On the Google side of TV land, you can expect more Gemini-powered features. The company is bringing the ability to search Google Photos for certain moments and people to Google TV, along with the options to remix photos into different styles and create slideshows on the fly. The Veo and Nano Banana AI video and photo generation models are coming to Google TV as well. You can also expect the ability to adjust TV settings using your voice. These Gemini features are coming to Google TV-powered TCL models first, then other devices in the following months. In the meantime, you can check out senior reporter Amy Skorheim’s hands-on impressions of the Gemini updates. Also in TV-related news, Peacock and Dolby have expanded their partnership. Currently, Peacock’s Sunday Night Football streams have Dolby Atmos support. You’ll soon be able to watch more live sports on Peacock with Dolby Vision and Atmos, as support for NBA and MLB events are on the way. Dolby Vision is coming to Sunday Night Football on Peacock too. Belkin, meanwhile, has a new wireless HDMI dongle that doesn't require a Wi-Fi connection. That should make it easy to beam videos from a device with a USB-C port to a TV, monitor or projector — handy if you’re planning an outdoor movie night in a space with spotty internet access.Monitors and projectorsLet's keep the focus on display tech for a bit with a look at some of the monitors and projectors we've seen at CES this year. Dell revealed a 52-inch ultrawide curved 6K monitor (the first such model on the planet, according to the company). The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature, in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and have a dedicated section of the display for each. That could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that setup. You can control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.Samsung and LG revealed some new gaming monitors just ahead of CES. Samsung’s 32-inch Odyssey 3D is a model that offers glasses-free 3D on a 6K display, while LG has a new bunch of 5K monitors. During CES, though, the latter also pulled back the curtain on the 27-inch UltraGear GX7, a $1,000 QHD OLED display with a 540Hz refresh rate.Samsung brought the latest version of its FreeStyle+ projector to the show. Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith checked out the new model in person and reckoned that Samsung has given the projector a serious upgrade over the previous iteration. The FreeStyle+ is now much brighter, while the updated keystone correction feature seems very useful.Elsewhere, Anker’s Soundcore announced the Nebula P1i, a 1080p portable projector with speakers that you can fold out and tilt. At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for summer camping trips, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.XGIMI was also at CES to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max. There’s no word on pricing yet, but this appears to be an upgraded version of the $3,999 Titan model.SamsungSamsung's Music Studio 5 speakers at CES 2026.Billy Steele for EngadgetSamsung being Samsung, the company had a lot more up its sleeve at CES than just TVs. In the lead up to the event, it announced its two new soundbars (we're had some hands-on time with one) and the stylish Music Studio speakers (we've got some IRL impressions of those as well). It also announced plans to bring Google Photos to TVs.At the First Look showcase on Sunday, Samsung talked up \"AI experiences everywhere. For everyone\" (sigh). Here, we saw more TVs, such as the thin S95H OLED, which has a zero-gap mount that allows you to position the unit flush against a wall. The First Look event has long been focused on home products. Naturally, Samsung execs discussed some features for the company's fridges, such as ​​recipe selection updates, AI cooling tech and Google Gemini-powered AI Vision that's said to be able to recognize more items and help you figure out what you need to buy without having to manually take inventory. FoodNote, meanwhile, is a weekly summary that breaks down what has gone in and out of your fridge.Moreover, Samsung highlighted the Samsung Bespoke AI Laundry Combo and its new AI wash cycle. With the new Air Dresser — which has an Auto Wrinkle Care feature — Samsung aims to help you do away with irons (thank you, Samsung). As for the Bespoke AI smart vacuum and mop, that can apparently keep an eye on your pets when you're not home.L'OrealA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L'Oreal often brings some interesting beauty tech to CES and the company did so again this year with a trio of gadgets. The LED Eye Mask uses red light and near-infrared light to address the likes of puffiness, discoloration and fine lines.The LED Face Mask seems to be a more pliable version of masks that we've seen from the likes of Dr. Dennis Gross, Omnilux, Therabody and Shark in recent years. However, it's at the prototype stage and it isn't expected to hit the market until next year. The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to help dry and style hair in similar fashion to L'Oreal's AirLight Pro. It has sensors that employ \"built-in proprietary algorithms and machine learning\" so they can adapt to your gestures and \"maximize individual experience.\" L'Oreal claims that while traditional straighteners can operate at 400°F or higher (temperatures that can damage hair), its latest innovation \"effectively straightens hair while never exceeding 320°F.\" You can expect the Light Straight to arrive in 2027 as well.MobileSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold EngadgetAt CES 2026, we had our first chance to go hands on with the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold, which the company officially announced last month. Senior writer Sam Rutherford had qualms about the bulkiness and the price (not confirmed yet for North America, but it costs around $2,500 in Korea). However, after Sam opened up the Galaxy Z TriFold, his “concerns were quickly pushed aside” by “10 inches of vivid AMOLED goodness.” That extra real estate may come in handy for many folks. Combined with a keyboard and perhaps a mouse, it could well be the laptop/tablet replacement many have been waiting for. Be sure to read Sam’s hands-on story for his full initial impressions.Almost exactly three decades after releasing its first proper clamshell flip phone, Motorola revealed its very first side-folding phone. The Razr Fold has a 6.6-inch external screen and a 8.1-inch main display, with stylus support on both. The camera array includes a 50MP main sensor from Sony, a 50MP ultra-wide/macro lens and a 50MP telephoto. There’s a 32MP external selfie camera and a 20MP internal sensor too. We’ll learn the full specs, pricing and availability info in the coming months.Back at CES 2024, we got to try out a keyboard phone accessory from Clicks. Fast forward two years, and the brand is making its own Blackberry-esque phones, as well as a new physical phone keyboard accessory. The Android 16-based Clicks Communicator has a tactile keyboard with a fingerprint sensor in the spacebar, a 4-inch OLED display, a 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) and expandable microSD storage up to 2TB. You can reserve one now for $399 — the price will increase to $499 on February 27.As for the new accessory, Clicks is calling that the Power Keyboard. It connects to an iOS or Android phone via MagSafe or Qi2, and it can operate as a power bank in a pinch thanks to the 2,150mAh battery. The Power Keyboard has Bluetooth functionality as well, so you can use it with devices like tablets, smart TVs and virtual reality headsets. Pre-orders are open now and the Power Keyboard is expected to ship in the spring. Early adopters can lock in a pre-order for $79 before the retail price jumps to $110.The Punkt MC03 phone.PunktThose who prefer their mobile phones to have fewer bells and whistles might be interested in the latest model from Punkt. The MC03 is a nifty-looking touchscreen model that runs on the privacy- and security-centric AphyOS, which is based on the Android Open Source Project. It has a UI that borrows a page out of the Light Phone's playbook, though you can still install any Android app. The MC03 will hit European markets this month for €699 / CHF699 / £610. There's a mandatory subscription, however. You get a year of access included with a phone purchase, then there’s a €10 / CHF10 / £9 monthly fee (paying for a long-term plan up front can reduce the cost by up to 60 percent).Charging techAnker and Belkin feel like CES mainstays at this point. They each had some interesting charging gear to show off this year. Belkin offered up a refreshed Nintendo Switch 2 case that recharges the console via its 10,000mAh power bank (which delivers up to 30W of fast charging). The case has an LCD screen on the outside to show you at a glance how much juice it has left and there’s a built-in kickstand for you to prop the console up on. Belkin’s new Switch 2 charging case costs $100 and it’s available now. The company’s new $100 UltraCharge Pro Power Bank can recharge two devices simultaneously. You can get your hands on that next month. There’s also a very slim BoostCharge power bank that can fit into your pocket. That will run you $60 and will ship later this year. Anker Nano Charger (45W, Smart Display, 180° Foldable)AnkerAnker unveiled its neat Nano Charger, which can identify the iPhone model you hook up to it and provide the appropriate level of charging power. This plug will arrive later this month for $40. The company announced a string of other products that can charge multiple devices at the same time. The $150 foldable Prime Wireless Charging Station can juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods simultaneously, with up to 25W of Qi2 wireless power. That’ll arrive by the end of March. There’s a 10-in-1 Nano Power Strip ($70, late January release) with 70W of output, surge protection and multiple USB-C ports, USB-A ports and AC outlets. Anker also showed off a 13-in-1 Nano Docking Station that you can snag right now for $150. Among other things, this supports up to three 4K displays, as much as 100W of upstream charging and 10 Gbps of data transfer between devices that are hooked up to it. Handy!AI Amazon introduced Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers.AmazonNo prizes for guessing that there was a ton of AI-related news at CES this year. Amazon, for one, announced that it's rolling out a web-based version of Alexa+. That means you won't necessarily need to have an Amazon device to try out the generative AI-powered assistant. However, Alexa+ Early Access customers are getting first dibs on the web version.Two Sweekar devices are pictured on a table, one wearing a pink and blue snowboarder outfit and the other (behind it) wearing a cowboy hat and outfitKarissa Bell for EngadgetThere were a boatload of AI-powered devices on the CES show floor too. One that we saw early on is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet from a startup called Takway. The Sweekar will remember your interactions with it (you'll need to feed and play with the pet to keep it healthy and happy). Once it's all grown up, the Sweekar will head off on virtual adventures and tell you about its exploits when it \"returns.\" Takway will soon start a Kickstarter campaign for the Sweekar, which will likely cost between $100 and $150.Ludens AI's Cocomo robot,Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetLudens AI, meanwhile, showed off a pair of AI companion robots that are admittedly pretty cute. Cocomo can react to your voice and touch interactions, follow you around your home and learn about you over time. It stays close to human body temps, so it feels cozy if you hug it. Inu, on the other hand, stays on your desktop. It, too, responds to your voice and touch. The Fraimic art display at CESAmy Skorheim for EngadgetWe also saw the Fraimic, an E Ink display that can tap into OpenAI to generate images. There's no subscription for the Fraimic ($399 for the standard size, which has a 13-inch display) and you get 100 AI-generated images per year included with your purchase. Pre-orders are open now and the Fraimic is expected to start shipping this spring.MindClip held in a hand.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetSome companies are still trying to make wearable AI devices happen. SwitchBot has a wearable mic called the AI MindClip, which can seemingly record and transcribe everything you say (no, thank you!). Anker’s Soundcore division got in on the mix too with its Work voice recorder.Plaid, meanwhile, brought its NotePin follow up to the dance. This time around, the NotePin S has a button that you can push to record conversations. You can also press the button to flag key moments for an AI-generated summary to focus on. The NotePin S is available now for $179, should you be enticed to buy such a thing. Subtle Voicebuds and the Subtle appSubtleAs for Subtle’s Voicebuds, those are said to be capable of picking up audio below the sound of a whisper, so you can very quietly dictate information to them and an AI model will transcribe what you can say. You can use the $199 voicebuds as regular earbuds too for making calls and listening to audio. However, you’ll need to fork over $17 a month for access to features like instant dictation and the option to transcribe notes without having to look at your phone (internet access is required to use Subtle’s best transcription models too). If you opt not to subscribe, the Voicebuds will use a smaller local model for transcription.On a similar note, Bee provided an update on what it’s bee-n up to since Amazon bought the company last year. It has developed four features that it’s rolling out to its existing AI voice recording wearable devices, including one that can draft an email when you mention that you need to send one, and another that highlights trends in what you say over a period of weeks or months. There’s also a voice notes feature, because that’s something you can’t do with your phone already.RobotsThe product version of Boston Dynamics' Atlas.Boston DynamicsBoston Dynamics’ Atlas robot is ready to roll. We’ve seen a few iterations of this machine over the last few years and now the company’s latest model is set to go into production. In addition, Boston Dynamics has teamed up with Google DeepMind to fuse Gemini Robotics AI foundation models into Atlas robots. Per a press release, the partnership \"will focus on enabling humanoids to complete a wide variety of industrial tasks and is expected to become a driving force of manufacturing transformation, beginning in the automotive industry.\" As it happens, Hyundai (Boston Dynamics’ majority shareholder) and DeepMind will be among the first to receive Atlas robots.Switchbot's Onero H1.Karissa Bell for EngadgetLG’s CLOiD is still a concept helper robot for now, but the Onero H1 is one you may be able to buy as soon as this year. During an in-person demo, we saw Switchbot’s Onero H1 robot (slowly) pick up clothes, chuck them in a washing machine and close the door. The company has also released a video that shows the Onero H1 carrying out other household tasks, from serving food and drinks to washing windows. We’re told Switchbot plans to sell the robot for \"less than $10,000.\"Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.Then there’s OlloBot, a companion robot with an optional extendable, fuzzy neck that’s warm to the touch. OlloBot is designed to “grow” alongside your family — it can capture special moments and develop its own personality. Data is stored locally on a removable heart-shaped module for both privacy and the ability to move it to a new OlloBot should your first one break. The device’s “face” is a tablet that can display videos, photo and expressions. The robot can handle calls, find missing items and help you control Matter-compatible smart home devices. It responds to your voice and touch too. The team behind the robot plans to fire up a Kickstarter campaign this summer. The regular model will cost about $1,000, while the one with an extending neck will run you about twice that. Best of all, there will be several outfits available for the robots, including a giraffe suit. Adorable!TransportationSony Honda Mobility Afeela Press Conference at CES 2026 AfeelaSony and Honda brought the latest revision of their first Afeela EV to CES 2026. We already knew that you’d be able to play your PS5 remotely while the vehicle is parked, though we learned some new details from the companies’ presentation. The Afeela 1 will debut with an advanced hands-off, eyes-on driver assistance system. The aim is to eventually offer Level 4 autonomy via over-the-air updates. Sony Honda Mobility plans to start shipments at the tail end of 2026, first in California, then in Arizona. However, after getting a close-up look at the latest iteration of the EV, Engadget contributor Tim Stevens reckons the Afeela 1 feels “more and more out of touch” with each passing year, even though it “was an audacious product when it was announced at CES 2020.”We also got our first look at a model that’s a further down the pike. The Afeela Prototype 2026 is a taller version of the first EV. Just don’t expect to be able to try it yourself until at least 2028.Longbow Motors SpeedsterTim Stevens for EngadgetLongbow Motors announced a pair of lightweight EVs that have a curb weight of just 2,200 pounds. The Speedster and Roadster boast advanced in-wheel motors from Donut Labs, a Verge Motorcycles spinoff. Longbow brought the Speedster to CES and the EV looks quite fetching. The vehicles will be pricey, though. Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, and that’s before factoring in costs such as tariffs.MuxiSegwaySegway is expanding its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi looks quite pretty and it has a cup holder (love that), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.Gaming Slide from NVIDIA's CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5NVIDIANVIDIA announced the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech. DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.NVIDIA also detailed a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.8BitDo FlipPad8BitDoThe FlipPad is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year, even though I don’t think I’d actually use it very much. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use. There are a bunch of neat physical controllers for phones that are built for landscape mode. But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. There are also several emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick. As noted in our live blog, Engadget’s UK bureau chief Mat Smith had a chance to try out the FlipPad. We also saw a new Xbox controller from 8BitDo that has swappable joysticks and button modules.A keyboard thing.CorsairWhy have a numpad on the side of your keyboard when you can have a highly customizable controller instead? Corsair slapped a Stream Deck into a keyboard and it looks absolutely rad. I’ve yet to take the plunge on a Stream Deck-style controller — partly because I’d rather not have an extra device on my desk. So, I’m very tempted to pick up the $350 Galleon 100 SD, which is available now.It has 12 programmable keys that you can use for gaming (give me that Helldivers 2 profile so I don’t have to keep punching in stratagem codes) or livestreaming, but there are plenty of other applications too. The side panel can help with video editing, controlling smart home devices or simply adjusting media playback. There’s a five-inch screen and two dials for fine control too. Oh, and it’s a full-sized mechanical keyboard to boot.GameSir had a couple of interesting controllers to tell us about. The Swift Drive (which seems to be a working name) has a steering wheel with force feedback in the middle of a regular gamepad. It’s a cool idea and it seems to work pretty well. The Swift Drive should hit the market later this year. In addition, GameSir teamed up with Hyperkin to make a modular controller that works with phones, tablets and Nintendo Switch consoles. You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2. That variant of the handheld is heading your way in June for $1,199. Razer had some concept gear to show off, including an AI-driven headset with built-in cameras that can recognize objects and text, and a gaming chair with haptic feedback and spatial audio. There’s also an AI desktop companion device with several avatars to choose from, including an anime girl and legendary League of Legends player Faker.AudioA speaker and a turntable.Victrola Victrola announced a pretty Bluetooth speaker that sits neatly underneath its turntables. You can use a cable to connect the two as well. Of course, you can play audio from other devices, including phones and tablets. I’ve had my eye on a Victrola turntable for a while (largely due to the Sonos integration), and the Soundstage speaker — available this summer for $350 — is tempting too. The three sizes from the Cambridge Audio L/R speaker series. Green speakers in three sizes.Cambridge AudioSpeaking of pretty speakers, I really like the aesthetic of these three wireless bookshelf options from Cambridge Audio. The classy-lookin’ L/R Series speakers start at $549 for a 100W model with a 21mm hard-dome tweeter with a 3-inch long-throw woofer but there’s no support for Wi-Fi streaming (there is Bluetooth aptX HD, though). At the top end is the $2,299 L/R X, a 800W speaker that has a a 2.5-way acoustic design with a 28mm Torus tweeter and dual five-inch woofers. There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model as well as on the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victrola and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course. JBL was at the event to show off a whole bunch of earbuds and gaming headsets. Shure now has a USB-C version of its MV88 condenser microphone, making it compatible with Android devices and recent iPhones. That’ll run you $159. The latest version of JLab’s teeny JBuds Mini earbuds now have customizable active noise cancellation (ANC) and yet they still cost $40. PartyStudio is a speaker with 128 different instrument sounds that works with any MIDI keyboard.Nathan Ingraham for EngadgetPartyStudio seems like a fun product — it’s a MIDI speaker with 128 built-in instrument tones and 50-plus drum machine patterns. There’s a companion 36-key MIDI keyboard called PartyKeys as well (the speaker will work with any MIDI keyboard, though). PopuMusic is the company behind both.Anker, meanwhile, has new AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds that are pretty interesting. They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds — which have Dolby Atmos support — and Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the outside of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now. Still, the audio quality is “excellent,” as Billy wrote in his hands-on story. Smart homeDreame Cyber X robot vacuumEngadgetAs ever, there was a ton of smart home gear at CES this year. One thing that caught our eye is a robot vacuum concept from Dreame. It's one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.Narwhal built a new vacuum for your mattress. The U50 is a handheld model that has a UV sterilization light. It has a high-speed tapping feature that can help dislodge gunk and mites. The company also showed off a new robot vacuum and mop with a \"PetCare Mode\" you can use to track down your bestest furry friend and keep an eye on them when you're not home. You can even talk to your pet via a speaker system. Both of these products should be available in the spring.Anker's Eufy brand has a new robot vacuum too, along with a video doorbell, outdoor light and smart lock. This one’s pretty interesting: Lockin’s latest vein-recognition smart lock can wirelessly recharge via an optical infrared beam emitted by a separate device that’s plugged into an outlet.On a similar note, Ring has updated its door, window and break glass sensors, and it has introduced an OBD-II car alarm, motion detectors and panic buttons. Most of those will be available in March, though you can pre-order the car alarm now.Elsewhere in home security, Ugreen announced a modular system that, refreshingly, does not require a subscription. Devices that are part of Ugreen’s platform — including a video doorbell and 4K cameras — should be available later this year.IKEA made its CES debut to show off some of its smart home tech, namely a string of budget-friendly, Matter-compatible devices. Along with some home sensors, the company plans to offer a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug and a $6 smart remote in the coming weeks. Senior reporter Amy Skorheim checked out the products and particularly liked the BILREA remote, which you can use to control IKEA's lamps and other devices.Amy also went hands-on (well, voice-on) with some pretty interesting devices from Emerson Smart. The company’s on-device voice command tech means that you can control its smart plugs, fans, heaters and air fryers without a Wi-Fi connection or having to set things up through an app.Philips Hue SpatialAware featureSpeaking of smart bulbs, Philips announced some Hue updates at CES. You'll need a Hue Bridge Pro to use the SpatialAware feature, which uses augmented reality to make sure all of the lights in a room are working together harmoniously to create, for instance, a more natural-looking sunset scene. Philips will be rolling out SpatialAware to Hue users this spring. Also on the way is Apple Home support for the Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell and Hue contact sensors.Elsewhere in lighting, Govee has a new floor lamp, as well as a ceiling light that's said to simulate a skylight.GE Profile Smart Fridge on display at CES Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn terms of kitchen tech, GE Appliances has a new smart refrigerator that's designed to make restocking easier. It has a built-in barcode scanner you can use to quickly add items to a shopping list. It's possible to sync the items to Instacart for grocery delivery. There's also an interior camera that can help you keep tabs on the goods in your fridge's crisper drawer. As you might expect for a smart fridge, it has a touchscreen on the door that you can use to call up recipes. The GE Profile Smart Refrigerator will be available in April for $4,899. Check out Amy’s hands-on story for our initial impressions.NoshDaniel Cooper for EngadgetNosh, meanwhile, is an AI cooking robot that you'll be able to buy in the next few months. Load it with ingredients, pick one of the 500 dishes in Nosh's repertoire and the robot will put everything together. While it has water and oil reservoirs, as well as a built-in spice rack, you'll still need to prep fresh ingredients before adding them to the machine. Nosh will cost $2,000 but if you're ready to pre-order now, you can snag one for an early bird price of $1,200.Moving outside, Whisper Aero claims that the T1 leaf blower (from its Tone Outdoors division) is 80 percent quieter and 60 percent more powerful than “leading gas handheld blowers.” That seems pretty great on paper, so here’s hoping that your noisy neighbors will be convinced to shell out $599 for a T1 when it arrives in September. Meanwhile, Segway’s Navimow unit has a bunch of new robot mowers. Health and accessibilityImage of the Throne Toilet Computer perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetIt perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that a toilet computer made an appearance in our roundup of weird CES tech. But if I’ve learned anything from watching Scrubs, it’s that our waste offers up a lot of revealing information about our health, so Throne is a pretty compelling device. It has a camera and microphone to track your bowel movements and urination levels. The idea is to figure out your regular toilet usage and then flag any deviations from that. The creators hope that Throne will help you gain a better understanding of your gut health, which could be beneficial for those on GLP-1 drugs or who have gastrointestinal conditions. Throne will start shipping in February for $340 and a $6 per month subscription.Image of Vivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo also showed off a toilet device that can monitor your urination levels. Not only that, the company unveiled a smart menstrual pad. The idea is for for wearers to scan the pad with their phone camera after use.Elsewhere, the latest version of Withing’s Body Scan scale can track 60 biomarkers, up from the 40 the first model;s 40. The Body Scan 2 should be available in the spring for $600.Image of the Eyebot KioskDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOne other health-focused product we found interesting was the Eyebot vision test booth. This kiosk aims to speed up the eye exam process with a test that takes just a couple of minutes. A licensed eye doctor who works remotely will take a look at Eyebot’s findings before signing off on a prescription. The kiosk can’t run medical tests, such as the brief blast of air that eye doctors use to assess the risk of glaucoma. But Engadget senior editor Daniel Cooper found that Eyebot’s findings perfectly matched the prescription he received from a professional last year.A man sits in a manual wheelchair with an add-on attached that gives it a large central front wheel and raises the casters off the groundCheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetAccessibility tech is a welcome presence at CES, and WheelMove looks like it could be useful for many wheelchair users. It’s a device with a large front wheel that can quickly be attached to any manual wheelchair. It can then raise the wheelchair’s smaller front wheels off the ground, primarily to help users navigate rough terrain. The $6,000 WheelMove will debut in France later their year before a broader rollout.ReviMo has built a robotic lift that it says can help people move themselves from (for instance) a bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a caregiver. The company expects Niko to cost around $15,000, but it’s attempting to get the device covered by insurance.Dephy's Sidekick, which the company describes as \"bionic footwear.\"Karissa Bell for EngadgetDephy’s Sidekick is designed as a walking aid. It’s an ankle-worn exoskeleton that hooks into a sneaker. The Sidekick has sensors that can detect the user’s gait and adapt to it in order to deliver an effective boost in each step. At $4,500, the Sidekick isn’t cheap, but it could be a boon for those who are perhaps not as physically active as they’d like to be. Dephy is also adapting the tech for athletic use — the company is working with Nike on a robotic sneaker project.WearablesPebble Round 2Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs ever, there were lots of wearables at CES. Pebble successor Core Devices was there with a followup to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted just over a decade ago. The circular ​​Pebble Round 2 has a far thinner bezel than its predecessor, a 1.3-inch color e-paper display and a promised battery life of over two weeks. The latest model from the revived smartwatch brand is coming your way in May for $199, and we've had a chance to try it out.Three Pebble Indexes side by side on a table.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThere's also a Pebble smart ring called the Index 01. It has a button that you can press to talk to Pebble's Claude-powered AI when there's something you want to remember. Engadget managing editor Cherlynn Low had a chance to pop one on at CES, and reckoned that Pebble and Core Devices founder Eric Migicovsky and his team might \"have the right approach to making an AI ring.\"You can pre-order the Index 01 now for $75. Once it starts shipping in March, the price will jump up to $99.Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThere was some intriguing news on the wristband front, particularly in terms of the Meta ecosystem. The company demoed a way to use its EMG wristband (which comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses) to control other devices, such as a car's infotainment system.On top of that, a startup called Hapware has made a haptic wristband that works with the computer vision functions of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. It's said to be capable of understanding the facial expressions and other nonverbal cues of people you're chatting with, which could be beneficial for folks who are blind, low vision or neurodivergent. The Alaye wristband starts at $359. You can pay $637 for a version that includes a one-year subscription. Otherwise, Hapware's required plan costs $29 per month.Smart glasses were present at CES as well. Xreal gave its entry-level One cinema glasses a spec bump and a new name. The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99. Like the Xreal 1S, it’s available now.The ROG XREAL R1 AR smartglasses are a collaboration between ASUS and XREAL made just for gamers.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetASUS and Xreal teamed up to make the gaming-focused ROG Xreal R1 smart glasses. They have 1080p displays with a 240Hz refresh rate. An included control dock has two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 1.4 port, making it a cinch to hook up and switch between console, handhelds and PC inputs. ASUS and Xreal have yet to announce a release date or pricing.Projector maker XGIMI also debuted its first smart glasses at CES, while Lumus demoed models with 30-degree and 70-degree fields of view. IXI had something compelling to show off too: a pair of glasses that can automatically focus on what you're looking at. The company is hoping to release a consumer version this year, Other things that caught our eyeThis roundup is pretty darn exhaustive (if I do say so myself), but there's still so much more that grabbed our attention at CES. Much of that tech perhaps doesn't quite fit neatly into the above categories. So let's jam through some of those announcements in bullet point format:HP revived an old trend by stuffing a computer inside a keyboard.We've long liked Satechi's Thunderbolt 4 docking stations around these parts, so you can bet the brand's first Thunderbolt 5 version will make us sit up and pay attention. With the Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock with SSD Enclosure and new Pro Cable, Satechi is promising support for multiple 8K monitors, 180W smart power delivery and up to 120 Gb/s transfer speeds. The dock has several other ports and slots, including a headphone jack. You can stuff an 8TB SSD into the $400 CubeDock too.Yukai Engineering's Baby FuFu is a larger version of the company’s drink-cooling Nekojita FuFu gizmo. It’s a portable fan for babies that hooks onto strollers.Anker's Eufy showed off a baby bottle washer with built-in water softener to help remove stubborn minerals, sterilization up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and the ability to dry bottles in 40 minutes. The Bottle Washer S1 also offers app control, the capability to clean up to eight bottle sets at once and the option to keep them in a sterile state for up to 72 hours.Clear Drop can compress soft plastics (such as grocery bags that recycling centers typically don't accept) into cubes that can be sent off for recycling. It's a compelling idea, even if the company's device costs $1,400.It's always fun to learn about developments in the smart bird feeder space. Birdbuddy showed off two new models in different sizes, each with HD cameras and mics that can identify birds by their songs. The larger Birdbuddy 2 also has built-in solar panels.That about does it for all the key news coming out of CES 2026.

          "standfirst": "LG opened CES 2026 by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a robot will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.There’s obvious reasons for this: AI swallowed the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of Panther Lake is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away from EVs and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on production lines, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch. At least, I hope they were pretending.I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I've got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many toilet computers, massage chairs and scootcases we all need in our daily lives. There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. Holographic AI waifus that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of AI Labubus operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a tablet on a moveable base that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens. I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CES is a launchpad for serious tech, but it’s also where companies proudly unveil devices that make you stop mid-scroll and whisper, “Wait, this is real?” We’ve been keeping a running list of the strangest, funniest and most unexpectedly compelling gadgets we’ve spotted in Las Vegas, from bathroom computers to robots that look like they escaped a Pixar pitch meeting. Also, be sure to check out our list of the best CES tech we saw this year at the show.Dreame Cyber X robot vacuumDreame Cyber XEngadgetRobot vacuums can be a little unsettling already, but Dreame’s Cyber X takes it up a level by sprouting chunky treaded “legs” and hauling itself up a full staircase like a tiny cleaning tank. In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.OlloBotTwo OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.CES loves a companion robot, but OlloBot might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.ASUS ROG Zephyrus DuoOn top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo's screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect. The Zephyrus Duo uses a detachable keyboard and a built-in kickstand so you can stack screens, spread out, or generally arrange your portable battle station however you like. It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.Throne toilet computerThe Throne device perched on the side of a toilet.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetThrone is a toilet-mounted computer that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual padVivoo's FlowPadVivooVivoo looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized. Alongside its clip-on smart toilet that analyzes your hydration by literally monitoring your pee, the company also unveiled a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics that can track fertility and hormone markers once you scan it with your phone. It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.Lenovo Legion Pro RollableWhile it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetLenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.Lenovo ThinkBook XD RollableWith its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6's basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIf the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the ThinkBook XD Rollable is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.OhDoki Handy 2 ProImage of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 ProDaniel Cooper for EngadgetOhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.iPolishiPolishDaniel Cooper for EngadgetiPolish finally made Total Recall nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.Hisense S6 FollowMe displayHisense S6 FollowMe displayHisenseDespite the name, Hisense’s FollowMe doesn’t actually follow you at all. It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.GE Profile Smart FridgeFinally! A reasonably sized fridge screen.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIf you’ve ever bought a “just in case” bag of spinach and discovered three more at home, GE’s latest smart fridge wants to be your grocery reality check. A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.L’Oréal LED eye maskA pair of transparent eye masks with wires and bulbs inside them.L'Oréal L’Oréal’s beauty tech lineup includes an LED eye mask that looks delightfully ridiculous in the best way: ultra-thin, semi-transparent silicone with visible microcircuitry that makes it feel like sci-fi skincare. The company says it precisely controls red and near-infrared wavelengths in 10-minute sessions, and it’s working on a companion serum so your skin doesn’t feel like it’s been left out to dry.

          "standfirst": "Even as CES 2026 wraps up soon, there’s no shortage of standout hardware hiding in plain sight. From genuinely quieter yard tools to ultra-light EVs and companion robots that want to remember your family, Day 3 was all about tech that felt a little more considered — and in some cases, refreshingly practical.If you can’t get enough of CES, be sure to check out our picks for best of CES 2026, which highlights the most impressive new tech we’ve seen in Las Vegas. We’ve also rounded up the CES gadgets you can buy right now if you’re itching to place an order, along with a look at the weirdest tech at CES 2026, because it wouldn’t be CES without a few delightfully unhinged ideas.Tone Outdoors T1 leaf blowerTone Outdoors T1Billy Steele for EngadgetThe Tone Outdoors T1 leaf blower is one of the rare CES gadgets that makes an immediate, obvious impression — mostly because it’s shockingly quiet. Whisper Aero’s aerospace-derived motor redesign delivers 880 CFM of airflow at around 52 decibels, which we could confirm even amid the noise of the show floor. It also runs up to 50 minutes in Eco mode, supports a forthcoming battery backpack and even includes an LED for nighttime cleanup. Pre-orders are open now for $599, with shipping expected in September.GE Profile Smart FridgeFinally! A reasonably sized fridge screen.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe GE Profile Smart Fridge is the first smart fridge we’ve seen that feels like it was designed around real problems instead of just slapping a massive screen on the door. GE’s AI assistant can answer practical questions like where your water filter is, scan groceries via a built-in barcode reader and keep tabs on produce with a crisper drawer camera. The eight-inch display feels refreshingly restrained, while integrations with Instacart and recipe suggestions add utility. It launches in March for $4,899, and for once, we’re genuinely curious what it would be like to live with it.Longbow Motors Speedster EVLongbow Motors SpeedsterBilly Steele for EngadgetLongbow Motors brought one of the most emotionally compelling EVs we’ve seen to CES, and it’s unapologetically minimalist. The Speedster uses in-wheel motors from Donut Labs to hit a jaw-dropping curb weight of just 2,200 pounds, lighter than a Miata. Its stripped-back interior, mystery shift lever and exposed motors feel like a direct rejection of touchscreen-heavy modern cars. It’s wildly expensive at just under $100,000, but also one of the few EVs here that got us excited to drive.OlloBot companion robotA robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetOlloBot might win the award for most charmingly strange robot on the show floor. Designed as a family “cyber pet,” it responds to voice and touch, develops a personality over time and stores all its memories locally in a removable heart-shaped module. The robot can help find lost items, make calls and eventually control Matter smart home devices. A Kickstarter is planned for summer, with pricing starting around $1,000.Bluetti Charger 2Here's how the Bluetti Charger 2 would work with dual charging sources.BluettiBluetti’s Charger 2 fixes a very specific but real problem for off-grid users: charging from your engine and solar panels at the same time. The dual-input system supports up to 600W from solar and 800W from an alternator, dramatically speeding up battery top-ups. It also works with multiple Bluetti power stations and can even jump-start your vehicle in a pinch. Early pricing is $349 through February 7, after which it jumps to $499.CES is ending, but we’ve got more stories to tellThe CES show floor will soon be closing down, but Engadget still has a lot of stories in our pipeline. As the crowds thin out, we’re continuing to surface the tech that actually stands out — whether it’s solving everyday annoyances or simply doing something bold and different. Stay tuned to our CES 2026 hub for more hands-ons, deep dives and final takeaways even after CES 2026 comes to a close at the end of this week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ces-2026-day-3-the-most-interesting-tech-thats-still-on-the-show-floor-134724231.html?src=rss",

From genuinely quieter yard tools to ultra-light EVs and companion robots that want to remember your family, Day 3 was all about tech that felt a little more considered — and in some cases, refreshingly practical.If you can’t get enough of CES, be sure to check out our picks for best of CES 2026, which highlights the most impressive new tech we’ve seen in Las Vegas. We’ve also rounded up the CES gadgets you can buy right now if you’re itching to place an order, along with a look at the weirdest tech at CES 2026, because it wouldn’t be CES without a few delightfully unhinged ideas.Tone Outdoors T1 leaf blowerTone Outdoors T1Billy Steele for EngadgetThe Tone Outdoors T1 leaf blower is one of the rare CES gadgets that makes an immediate, obvious impression — mostly because it’s shockingly quiet. Whisper Aero’s aerospace-derived motor redesign delivers 880 CFM of airflow at around 52 decibels, which we could confirm even amid the noise of the show floor. It also runs up to 50 minutes in Eco mode, supports a forthcoming battery backpack and even includes an LED for nighttime cleanup. Pre-orders are open now for $599, with shipping expected in September.GE Profile Smart FridgeFinally! A reasonably sized fridge screen.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe GE Profile Smart Fridge is the first smart fridge we’ve seen that feels like it was designed around real problems instead of just slapping a massive screen on the door. GE’s AI assistant can answer practical questions like where your water filter is, scan groceries via a built-in barcode reader and keep tabs on produce with a crisper drawer camera. The eight-inch display feels refreshingly restrained, while integrations with Instacart and recipe suggestions add utility. It launches in March for $4,899, and for once, we’re genuinely curious what it would be like to live with it.Longbow Motors Speedster EVLongbow Motors SpeedsterBilly Steele for EngadgetLongbow Motors brought one of the most emotionally compelling EVs we’ve seen to CES, and it’s unapologetically minimalist. The Speedster uses in-wheel motors from Donut Labs to hit a jaw-dropping curb weight of just 2,200 pounds, lighter than a Miata. Its stripped-back interior, mystery shift lever and exposed motors feel like a direct rejection of touchscreen-heavy modern cars. It’s wildly expensive at just under $100,000, but also one of the few EVs here that got us excited to drive.OlloBot companion robotA robot with eyes on top of a screen showing a smile.Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetOlloBot might win the award for most charmingly strange robot on the show floor. Designed as a family “cyber pet,” it responds to voice and touch, develops a personality over time and stores all its memories locally in a removable heart-shaped module. The robot can help find lost items, make calls and eventually control Matter smart home devices. A Kickstarter is planned for summer, with pricing starting around $1,000.Bluetti Charger 2Here's how the Bluetti Charger 2 would work with dual charging sources.BluettiBluetti’s Charger 2 fixes a very specific but real problem for off-grid users: charging from your engine and solar panels at the same time. The dual-input system supports up to 600W from solar and 800W from an alternator, dramatically speeding up battery top-ups. It also works with multiple Bluetti power stations and can even jump-start your vehicle in a pinch. Early pricing is $349 through February 7, after which it jumps to $499.CES is ending, but we’ve got more stories to tellThe CES show floor will soon be closing down, but Engadget still has a lot of stories in our pipeline. As the crowds thin out, we’re continuing to surface the tech that actually stands out — whether it’s solving everyday annoyances or simply doing something bold and different.

          "title": "Lego is trying to make tech invisible with Smart Play",
          "standfirst": "Probably my favorite thing about the Lego Smart Play system unveiled this week at CES is that it was designed for kids, first and foremost. In the past 10 years or so, Lego has increasingly courted an older audience with more expensive and elaborate sets. But when it was time to bring more advanced technology to Lego, the idea right from the beginning was more social and interactive play. If you haven’t heard about Smart Play yet, its a way for Lego to make its sets more interactive. A Smart Brick filled with sensors makes it so sets can respond to each other, know when they’re moving, play sounds and know when the corresponding Smart Minifigures are near them. Tiny Smart Tags, meanwhile, help the Smart Brick know the context of how it’s being used — whether it’s in a helicopter, car or duck for example. Tom Donaldson, senior VP and Head of Creative Play Lab at the LEGO Group, told Engadget that the company worked on Smart Play for about eight years before introducing it this week, and that social play was the starting point. “We started really looking at consumer needs, and this idea that kids really like social play,” said Donaldson “Kids really like the sort of things that change when they come back to them, and the kids really like agency. They want to be able to change things.” Lego's Tom Donaldson demoing Smart Play at CES.LEGOBut a big part of the creation process was making the Smart Brick as flexible and powerful as possible and then seeing what scenarios could take advantage of it. “We wanted to build a really powerful platform,” he said. “What we shouldn't do is say, ‘this is what we think we're gonna need.’ We needed to say, ‘let's create something that has a lot of capabilities that we can then figure out how to use.’”One of the conflicts with the tech-packed Smart Play system, though, might be the cost. Obviously, Lego has been successful at most ventures it has undertaken in recent years, but the pricing of Smart Play sets could make adoption a bit challenging. The biggest Smart Play set, Star Wars Throne Room Duel & A-Wing, for example, has almost 1,000 pieces and costs $160. That’s quite a bit more than comparably sized sets. The dual factors of the Star Wars license and Smart Play tech certainly impacted the cost. Lego Smart Play Star Wars setLEGOThe set includes two Smart Bricks, five Smart Tags and three Smart Minifigures, the most “smart” gear included in any of the initial three Star Wars Smart Play sets. Will parents shell out for the more advanced capabilities that Smart Play offers, or will they stick with standard sets? For now, Lego is betting the extremely broad appeal of Star Wars will help these new Smart Play sets find an audience. About three years ago, Lego got its team focused on the Star Wars franchise involved, as well as Lucasfilm, to figure out how to roll Smart Play out to the world. “Very early on, we all decided that starting with the original trilogy would be great,” said Derek Stothard, Disney’s Director of Global Licensing “These are such well-known scenes and characters, and they cross generations, so parents can introduce them to their kids. All that works really well together.” Unsurprisingly, Lego is being coy about where things go beyond the initial three Star Wars sets, but it’s clear that after eight years of development, they’ll want to bring it to as many product lines as possible. “We're announcing a platform that you can see has tremendous growth [potential], Donaldson said. “We made the analogy with the minifigure as something that you’ll see across the entire [Lego] system, maybe not in every single SKU but it’ll reappear in many different places. But ultimately we're a company that really focuses on giving kids what they want, what they love, and we'll have to see how it lives in a market.”That last point about how it lives in the market is a good one, particularly given the pricing. We probably won’t know for sure until Lego moves beyond the safe confines of Star Wars and really shows us what Smart Play can do across more varied scenarios. And going to non-licensed sets might be where Smart Play really takes off — it’s easy to imagine a cheaper Smart Play add-on kit that can bring sets to life at a lower cost. But the idea of transforming anything kids create into something more interactive has a ton of potential if Lego can broaden its appeal beyond Star Wars fans.

If passed, the bill would go into effect in May and would also require adult sites to pay a $500 annual fee to the State Tax Commission. Per the legislation, the money made from the tax will be used by Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to provide more mental health support for teens. Musselman did not respond to a request for comment.Read full article Comments",

The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. ESA is also making money available to incentivize rocket upgrades to haul heavier cargo into orbit. ESA, the European Commission, and national governments are funding rocket hoppers to demonstrate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. While there is significant money behind these efforts, the projects are not unified, and progress has been slow.Read full article Comments",

An increasingly popular approach geared toward LLMs called \"content chunking\" may fall into that category. In the latest installment of Google's Search Off the Record podcast, John Mueller and Danny Sullivan say that breaking content down into bite-sized chunks for LLMs like Gemini is a bad idea. You've probably seen websites engaging in content chunking and scratched your head, and for good reason—this content isn't made for you. The idea is that if you split information into smaller paragraphs and sections, it is more likely to be ingested and cited by generative AI bots like Gemini. So you end up with short paragraphs, sometimes with just one or two sentences, and lots of subheds formatted like questions one might ask a chatbot. According to Sullivan, this is a misconception, and Google doesn't use such signals to improve ranking. \"One of the things I keep seeing over and over in some of the advice and guidance and people are trying to figure out what do we do with the LLMs or whatever, is that turn your content into bite-sized chunks, because LLMs like things that are really bite size, right?\" said Sullivan. \"So... we don't want you to do that.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country's communications regulatory agency, AGCOM, announced yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities. AGCOM issued the fine under Italy's controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company's annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent. The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren't subject to the dispute over piracy.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Collecting fallen (or \"shed\") elk antlers is a popular pastime in elk-heavy places like Montana, but it's usually a pretty low-tech, on-the-ground affair. That's why last year's story about a US Black Hawk helicopter descending from the skies to harvest shed elk antlers on a ranch was such an odd one. Was it really possible that US military personnel were using multimillion-dollar government aircraft to land on private property in the Crazy Mountains—yes, that's their actual name—just to grab some antlers valued at a few hundred bucks? Antler hunt In May 2025, Montana rancher Linda McMullen received a call from a neighbor. \"He said, 'Linda, there’s a green Army helicopter landed on your place, picking up elk antlers,’” McMullen told The New York Times last year. “I said, ‘Are you joking?’ He said, ‘I’m looking at them with binoculars.’”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Poisoned arrows or darts have long been used by cultures all over the world for hunting or warfare. For example, there are recipes for poisoning projective weapons, and deploying them in battle, in Greek and Roman historical documents, as well as references in Greek mythology and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Chinese warriors over the ages did the same, as did the Gauls and Scythians, and some Native American populations. Archaeologists have now found traces of a plant-based poison on several 60,000-year-old quartz Stone Age arrowheads found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the journal Science Advances. That would make this the oldest direct evidence of using poisons on projectiles—a cognitively complex hunting strategy—and pushes the timeline for using poison arrows back into the Pleistocene. The poisons commonly used could be derived from plants or animals (frogs, beetles, venomous lizards). Plant-based examples include curare, a muscle relaxant that paralyzes the victim's respiratory system, causing death by asphyxiation. Oleander, milkweeds, or inee (onaye) contain cardiac glucosides. In Southeast Asia, the sap or juice of seeds from the ancar tree is smeared on arrowheads, which causes paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest due to the presence of toxins like strychnine. Several species of aconite are known for their use as arrow poisons in Siberia and northern Japan.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing Internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company. “There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.” Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest Internet.Read full article Comments",

You can get a taste of what we're expecting this year in this feature. Other storylines are also worth watching this year that didn't make the Top 20. Will SpaceX's Starship begin launching Starlink satellites? Will United Launch Alliance finally get its Vulcan rocket flying at a higher cadence? Will Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket be certified by the US Space Force? I'm looking forward to learning the answers to these questions, and more. As for what has already happened in 2026, it has been a slow start on the world's launch pads, with only a pair of SpaceX missions completed in the first week of the year. Only? Two launches in one week by any company would have been remarkable just a few years ago. As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. New launch records set in 2025. The number of orbital launch attempts worldwide last year surpassed the record 2024 flight rate by 25 percent, with SpaceX and China accounting for the bulk of the launch activity, Aviation Week & Space Technology reports. Including near-orbital flight tests of SpaceX’s Starship-Super Heavy launch system, the number of orbital launch attempts worldwide reached 329 last year, an annual analysis of global launch and satellite activity by Jonathan’s Space Report shows. Of those 329 attempts, 321 reached orbit or marginal orbits. In addition to five Starship-Super Heavy launches, SpaceX launched 165 Falcon 9 rockets in 2025, surpassing its 2024 record of 134 Falcon 9 and two Falcon Heavy flights. No Falcon Heavy rockets flew in 2025. US providers, including Rocket Lab Electron orbital flights from its New Zealand spaceport, added another 30 orbital launches to the 2025 tally, solidifying the US as the world leader in space launch.Read full article Comments",

Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would write down $19.5 billion as a result of its failed EV bet. GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year. But GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles. Add to that the hostility from car dealers by having to sell EVs in the first place, and one can see why GM has decided to retreat, even if we might not sympathize.Read full article Comments",
