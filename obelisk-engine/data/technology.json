          "standfirst": "How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.The AI revolution finds an unexpected leaderEnterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil scienceBaxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.The declaration that changed everythingThe pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.Mining corporate memory for AI goldTurning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizerEarly trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.From drones to demand forecasting across the enterpriseThe transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.Competing like a startupSMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.When innovation meets immovable objectsNot every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futuresThe roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.What traditional industries can learnScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.",

(Getty Images) You've known it for a while: Microsoft has determined that it's moving Windows 10 to \"end of life\" status starting on October 14. That means while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work after that date, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. That leaves you with three choices if you want to make sure your computer remains secure: You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible. You can buy a new PC that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook). Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year. Since the last one is easy — and can now be done for free in many cases — that's what we're focusing on here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least. How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer We can question Microsoft's motives for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely. At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen. Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings > System > About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available. Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see \"Administrator\" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings > Your Info.) Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not) If you see an option to upgrade to Windows 11, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates. Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates Sign up for ESU by selecting Update & Security from the Settings menu. Click the \"Enroll Now\" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it). Find out if you need to update your computer. (Screenshot/Engadget) If you're not seeing the \"Enroll now\" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above). By enrolling in Extended Security Updates, you'll have another year before you need to upgrade to Windows 11. (Screenshots/Engadget) Step 5: Choose your upgrade method Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to be using your administrator account to get started. Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube) That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with no strings attached.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this \"free\" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe. The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first 5 GB of storage. Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings > OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start. Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says \"Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates.\" Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done. A note: Thanks to YouTube's Explaining Computers channel, where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their full video if you'd like a deeper dive into the process. That's it, you're done! (Until next year) You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are. You did it right if you see this window.

          "content": "You'll get access to Windows 10 a little longer by doing this. (Getty Images) You've known it for a while: Microsoft has determined that it's moving Windows 10 to \"end of life\" status starting on October 14. That means while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work after that date, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. That leaves you with three choices if you want to make sure your computer remains secure: You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible. You can buy a new PC that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook). Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year.

Some gorgeous new games arrived this week, and we've got some demos and reveals from upcoming projects to take a look at. Later this month, Lorelai and the Laser Eyes studio Simogo is going to celebrate its 15th anniversary with some news and surprises. Perhaps the developer is porting some of its earlier games to more platforms. I'm hoping that we'll learn about Simogo's next game as well.I'm not holding out hope for a sequel to Sayonara Wild Hearts, which is my favorite game of all time depending on the day you ask me (on other days, it's The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, FYI). However, if Simogo announces a live concert of music from the game, I'm going to do my damndest to be there. I'll be tuning in on October 28 to learn what the studio has for me us in any case.Speaking of showcases, Entalto Publishing and developer GGTech ran one of their own this week. The Out of Bounds event shone a spotlight on a dozen indie games, spanning a breadth of genres. Also, a quick reminder that the latest Steam Next Fest starts at 1PM ET on Monday, October 13. As always, the week-long event will have tons of demos for you to check out. It’s always worth trying a bunch of them. You never know, you might end up being one of the first few folks to play the next Balatro, Manor Lords or Deep Rock Galactic Survivor.New releasesAbsolum is a beat-'em-up from the folks behind Streets of Rage 4. It's the first original IP from Dotemu, which has found success with the likes of the terrific Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. It co-developed this game with Guard Crush Games and Supamonks. The art and animation from the latter looks absolutely divine. You can play Absolum solo or with a friend. Since it's a roguelite, you'll gain upgrades to bolster your character on each run while earning experience that goes toward permanent progression. There are multiple paths to explore, so the replayability factor seems strong here. Engadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent some time with Absolum this summer and was impressed by it. The game received strong reviews this week too.Absolum is out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5. Dotemu also has another beat-'em-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, coming soon.A few reviews I've read for Bye Sweet Carole (which are fairly mixed) dinged it for having clunky controls and some other quality-of-life problems, such as getting softlocked while trying to complete puzzles. I hope Little Sewing Machine can iron out those issues since the presentation of this game is quite something. It looks like an early-'90s animated movie, with hand-drawn animations and, seemingly, a soundtrack to match. Bye Sweet Carole is a 2D horror-platformer from publisher Maximum Entertainment in which you play as a young girl trying to find her best friend, who disappeared from an orphanage. It's out now on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S.Want to see another new game with a unique look that makes it stand out from the crowd? Of course you do. Exploration action game Dreams of Another — which landed on PS5, PS VR2 and Steam this week — sees you creating the environment in a dream-like world by shooting at it. Director Baiyon (PixelJunk Eden) and the team at Q-Games used point cloud rendering technology to create the unusual, but captivating visuals. Dunno why they felt the need to put a clown in this game though. Clowns are rotten things.Dreams of Another arrived on the same day that Q-Games' PixelJunk Eden 2 hit PS4, PS5 and Steam (it's coming to Epic Games Store as well). That game debuted on Nintendo Switch in 2020.Here's yet another lovely-looking project, and this time it's a pixel-art game from Teenage Astronauts and publisher No More Robots. In Little Rocket Lab, you play as aspiring engineer Morgan, who sets out to build factories with the aim of achieving her family's dream of making a rocket ship. It’s more build a rocket, girl, than Build A Rocket Boy.This is a blend of a factory builder and life sim, and it looks rather charming. Little Rocket Lab has touched down on Steam and Xbox. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. On the subject of pixel-art games, I couldn't not include one that came out this week from a developer based in my hometown. Cairn: Mathair’s Curse is a turn-based RPG. It's set in the early 2000s in the Scottish Highlands and it sees a young lad and his mates dealing with the aftermath of a cult casting an ancient curse on their home. Solo developer Ross McRitchie spent five years making Cairn: Mathair’s Curse and his partner, Christine, composed the Celtic soundtrack. It's said to have plenty of Scottish humor, which speaks to me. The game, which Steam reviews have likened to EarthBound, is out on Steam now.Upcoming I'm looking forward to checking out Blackwood, which is slated to hit Steam in the second half of 2026. It has a pretty great pitch:By day, you run a DVD store in 2012 New York. By night, you’re a ruthless assassin. Blackwood is a cinematic third-person shooter with grounded melee combat, brutal takedowns, responsive gunplay and a double life to manage.The facial animations look a little rough in the reveal trailer, but it's alpha footage and there's plenty of time to polish it. I'm hoping the team at Bangladesh-based AttritoM7 Productions manages to do that, because otherwise this game is looking quite nifty with its John Wick-style combat.I do love a game with a great name, and I've got a couple to tell you about. Action RPG Bittersweet Birthday has hand-drawn pixel art and nothing but boss battles when it comes to combat. Bittersweet Birthday — from World Eater Games and publisher Dangen Entertainment — is set to land on Steam, GOG, Humble and Itch on November 11. It's coming to consoles later.Here’s a pinball-themed precision platformer in the mold of games like Baby Steps and Getting Over It. Fittingly, it's called A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad and you can control it with a single button.There’s no release date as yet for this project from Azimuth Studios. However, a demo is available on Steam now. Like a good teenage cousin, it's fun and annoying in equal measure.Another pre-Next Fest demo I've had a chance to check out is for Don't Stop, Girlypop!, a fast-paced arena shooter with an anti-capitalist bent. I've been looking forward to this one since I found out about it late last year. The demo, with its Y2K girly-pop aesthetics and Doom Eternal/Ultrakill-style gameplay, does not disappoint. I'm glad the team trimmed the first word from the original name — Incolatus: Don't Stop, Girlypop! — since the shorter version is much punchier and more memorable. Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee haven't revealed a release date as yet, but I'll be checking my T9 flip phone impatiently in the meantime.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/stylish-beat-em-ups-platformers-and-rpgs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000184.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Proton VPN review 2025: A nonprofit service with premium performance",
          "standfirst": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Table of contents Findings at a glance Installing, configuring and using Proton VPN Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols How much does Proton VPN cost? Proton VPN side apps and bundles Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Investigating Proton VPN's server network Features of Proton VPN Proton VPN customer support options Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Final verdict Findings at a glance The table summarizes what we found while reviewing Proton VPN, both good and bad. Keep it open in a tab while you comparison shop for a VPN. Category Notes Installation and UI Windows has the best interface, but all apps are smooth Android users get unique preset protocols Browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox can be used for split tunneling on Mac and iOS Speed Retains 88 percent of download speeds and 98 percent of upload speeds Global latency average stays under 300 ms, with 52 ms on the fastest server Security No DNS leaks or WebRTC leaks on any servers Full IPv6 support is available on Android, Linux and browser extensions; Mac, Windows and iOS still block IPv6 to prevent leaks WireShark test showed active packet encryption Pricing Best plan costs $81.36 for two years ($3.39 per month) Free plan includes unlimited data and critical security features, but you can't choose your server Bundles Proton Unlimited saves money if you want two or more Proton products Privacy policy General Proton policy prevents collection of IP addresses unless a user has violated the terms of service (such as by using a Proton VPN server to abuse another site) No third parties are allowed to handle personally identifiable information Confirmed by Securitum audit in 2024 Virtual location change Unblocked Netflix repeatedly in all five testing locations, with new content proving a successful location change A free server in Romania got into Netflix but had trouble loading the library Server network 154 locations in 117 countries More servers in Africa than any other VPN, plus many others across the globe About two-thirds of server locations are virtual Features NetShield can block just malware, or all malware, ads and trackers Kill switch on all platformsSplit tunneling on Windows, Android and browser extensions only Secure Core servers route VPN through two locations, one of which is physically secured in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland Almost all paid servers are P2P-enabled Tor over VPN servers in six countries let you access dark web sites from any browser Profiles saves time when you repeatedly need specific connection settings Customer support Most articles in the online help center, while well-written, are invisible unless you use the search function Live chat is only for paying customers, and is unavailable from midnight to 9 AM CET Background check Launched in 2017 by the same company that developed ProtonMail Majority owned by the Proton Foundation, whose board includes the company founders and can resist takeover attempts While ProtonMail has worked with Swiss authorities in the past, Proton VPN is not governed by the same laws that compelled this Claims of a vulnerability in WireGuard's memory don't hold water Installing, configuring and using Proton VPN This section explains how it feels to run Proton VPN on the various platforms it supports. As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Weaponized AI can dismantle patches in 72 hours — but Ivanti's kernel defense can help",
          "standfirst": "Adversaries from cybercrime gangs to nation-state cyberattack squads are fine-tuning weaponized AI with the goal of defeating new patches in 3 days or less. The quicker the attack, the more time to explore a victim’s network, exfiltrate data, install ransomware or set up reconnaissance that will last for months or years. Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks \"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they&#x27;re doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,\" Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at Ivanti told VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"They&#x27;re able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of that release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.\"This isn&#x27;t theoretical speculation. It&#x27;s the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls \"tangible evidence\" of the company&#x27;s commitment to meeting this threat head-on.At DEF CON 33 researchers from AmberWolf proved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in Zscaler, Netskope, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler&#x27;s failure to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2025-54982), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure.Why Kernel Security matters The kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware. If an attacker compromises the kernel, they&#x27;ve seized total control of a device that can scale to compromising an entire network. Any other security layer or application, platform or safeguard is immediately bypassed with attackers take control of the kernel.Nearly all operating systems rely on the concept of enforcing rings of privilege. Applications run in user mode with limited access. The kernel operates in kernel mode with complete control. When adversaries break that barrier, they’ve gained access to what many security researchers consider the holy grail of a systems and entire networks’ vulnerabilities.Ivanti&#x27;s new release directly addresses this reality. Connect Secure 25.X runs on an enterprise-grade Oracle Linux operating system with strong Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enforcement that can limit a threat actor&#x27;s abilities within the system. The solution includes Secure Boot protection, disk encryption, key management, secure factory reset, a modern secure web server, and Web Application Firewall (WAF), all designed to secure key aspects of the system and significantly deter external threats.\"In the past year, we&#x27;ve significantly advanced our Secure by Design strategy, translating our commitment into real action through substantial investments and an expanded security team,\" Riemer explained. \"This release stands as tangible evidence of our commitment. We listened to our customers, invested in both technology and talent, and modernized the security of Ivanti Connect Secure to provide the resilience and peace of mind our customers expect and deserve.\"From OS rings to Deployment Rings: A more complete defense strategyWhile operating system rings define privilege levels, modern patch management has adopted its own ring strategy to combat the 72-hour exploit window. Ring deployment provides a phased, automated patching strategy that rolls out updates incrementally: a Test Ring for core IT validation, an Early Adopter Ring for compatibility testing, and a Production Ring for enterprise-wide rollout.This approach directly addresses the speed crisis. Ring deployment achieves 99% patch success within 24 hours for up to 100,000 PCs, according to Gartner research. Ponemon Institute research shows organizations take an alarming average of 43 days to detect cyberattacks even after a patch is released.Jesse Miller, SVP and director of IT at Southstar Bank, emphasized: \"When judging how impactful something can be, you have to take everything from current events, your industry, your environment and more into the equation.\" His team uses ring deployment to reduce their attack surface as quickly as possible.Attackers aggressively exploit legacy vulnerabilities with 76% of vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware were reported between 2010 and 2019. When kernel access is at stake, every hour of delay multiplies the risk exponentially.The Kernel Dilemma centers on balancing security versus stabilityAt CrowdStrike&#x27;s FalCon conference, Chief Technology Innovation Officer Alex Ionescu laid out the problem: \"By now, it&#x27;s clear that if you want to protect against bad actors, you need to operate in the kernel. But to do that, the reliability of your machine is put at risk.\"The industry is responding with fundamental shifts:Microsoft&#x27;s WISP mandates multi-year changes for every Windows security vendorLinux embraced eBPF for safer kernel instrumentationApple&#x27;s Endpoint Security Framework enables user-mode operationAuthentication bypass happens when kernels are compromised AmberWolf researchers spent seven months analyzing ZTNA products. Zscaler failed to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2024-54982). Netskope&#x27;s authentication could be bypassed using non-revocable OrgKey values. Check Point had hard-coded SFTP keys (CVE-2025-3831).These vulnerabilities existed for months. Some vendors patched quietly without CVEs. As of August 2025, 16 months after disclosure, many organizations still used exploitable configurations.Lessons learned from compressing 3 years of kernel security into 18 months When nation-state attackers exploited Ivanti Connect Secure in January 2024, it validated Ivanti’s decision to rapidly advance its kernel-level security strategy, compressing a three-year project into just 18 months. As Riemer explained, \"We had already completed phase one of the kernel-hardening project before the attack. That allowed us to quickly pivot and accelerate our roadmap.”Key accomplishments included:Migration to 64-bit Oracle Linux: Ivanti replaced an outdated 32-bit CentOS OS with Oracle Linux 9, significantly reducing known vulnerabilities tied to legacy open-source components.Custom SELinux enforcement: Implementing strict SELinux policies initially broke a significant number of product features, requiring careful refactoring without compromising security parameters. The resulting solution now runs in permanent enforcement mode, Riemer explained. Process de-privileging and secure boot with TPM: Ivanti eliminated root privileges from critical processes and integrated TPM-based secure boot and RSA encryption, ensuring continuous integrity checks, aligning with AmberWolf’s research recommendations and findings.There were also a series of independent penetration testing initiatives, and each confirmed zero successful compromises, with threat actors typically abandoning attempts within three days. Riemer explained to VentureBeat that global intelligence community customers actively watched threat actors probe the hardened systems. \"They tried old TTPs, pivoted to web server exploits. They pretty much gave up after about three days,\" Riemer said. The decision to go kernel-level wasn&#x27;t a panic response. \"We actually had plans in place in 2023 to address this before we ever got attacked,\" Riemer said. The conversation that sealed the decision happened in Washington, DC. \"I sat down with the CIO of a federal agency, and I asked him flat out: Is there going to be a need for the U.S. government to have an L3 VPN solution on-prem in the future?\" Riemer recalled. \"His response was that there would always be a mission need for an L3 VPN on-prem type solution in order to give encrypted communication access to the warfighter.\"The future beyond kernel security includes eBPF and Behavioral MonitoringGartner&#x27;s Emerging Tech Impact Radar: Cloud Security report rates eBPF as having \"high\" mass with 1-3 years to early majority adoption. \"The use of eBPF allows for enhanced visibility and security without relying solely on kernel-level agents,\" Gartner notes.The majority of cybersecurity security vendors are investing heavily in eBPF. \"Today, almost our entire customer base runs Falcon sensor on top of eBPF,\" Ionescu said during his keynote at this year’s Fal.Con. \"We&#x27;ve been part of that journey as eBPF foundation members.\"Palo Alto Networks has also emerged as a major player in eBPF-based security, investing heavily in the technology for their Cortex XDR and Prisma Cloud platforms. This architectural shift allows Palo Alto Networks to provide deep visibility into system calls, network traffic, and process execution while maintaining system reliability.The convergence of CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and other major vendors on eBPF technology signals a fundamental transformation—providing the visibility security teams need without catastrophic failure risks.Defensive strategies that are workingPatching is often relegated to one of those tasks that gets procrastinated about because so many security teams are short-handed, facing chronic time shortages. Those are the conditions that adversaries bank on when they choose victims. It’s a sure bet that if a company is not prioritizing cybersecurity, they will be months or even years back on their patching. That’s what adversaries look for. Patterns emerge from different industries of victims and they share a common trait of procrastinating about system maintenance in general and security patterns specifically. Based on interviewing victims of breaches that started with patches sometimes years old, VentureBeat has seen the following immediate steps they take to reduce the probabilo9ty of being hit again: Automate patching immediately. Monthly cycles are obsolete. Tony Miller, Ivanti&#x27;s VP of enterprise services, confirmed ring deployment eliminates the reactive patching chaos that leaves organizations vulnerable during the critical 72-hour window.Audit kernel-level security. Ask vendors about eBPF/ESF/WISP migration plans and timelines.Layer defenses. This is table stakes for any cybersecurity strategy but critical to get right. \"Whether it was SELinux profiling, root privilege avoidance, an updated web server, or the WAF—each layer stopped attacks,\" Riemer said.Demand transparency. \"Another vendor had been attacked in November 2023. That information didn&#x27;t come available until August 2024,\" Riemer revealed. \"This is why Ivanti has been so public about transparency.\"The bottom lineKernel-level transformation isn&#x27;t optional. It&#x27;s survival when AI weaponizes vulnerabilities in three days.Ivanti Connect Secure 25.X represents what&#x27;s possible when a vendor commits fully to kernel-level security, not as a reactive measure, but as a fundamental architectural principle. Gartner&#x27;s strategic planning assumption is sobering: \"By 2030, at least 80% of enterprise Windows endpoints will still rely on hybrid endpoint protection agents, increasing the attack surface and requiring rigorous validation.\"Organizations must harden what they can now, automate immediately, and prepare for architectural upheaval. As Gartner emphasizes, combining ring deployment with integrated compensating controls including endpoint protection platforms, multifactor authentication, and network segmentation as part of a broader zero-trust framework ensures security teams can shrink exposure windows.",
          "content": "Adversaries from cybercrime gangs to nation-state cyberattack squads are fine-tuning weaponized AI with the goal of defeating new patches in 3 days or less. The quicker the attack, the more time to explore a victim’s network, exfiltrate data, install ransomware or set up reconnaissance that will last for months or years. Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks \"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they&#x27;re doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,\" Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at Ivanti told VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"They&#x27;re able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of that release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.\"This isn&#x27;t theoretical speculation. It&#x27;s the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls \"tangible evidence\" of the company&#x27;s commitment to meeting this threat head-on.At DEF CON 33 researchers from AmberWolf proved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in Zscaler, Netskope, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler&#x27;s failure to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2025-54982), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure.Why Kernel Security matters The kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware. If an attacker compromises the kernel, they&#x27;ve seized total control of a device that can scale to compromising an entire network. Any other security layer or application, platform or safeguard is immediately bypassed with attackers take control of the kernel.Nearly all operating systems rely on the concept of enforcing rings of privilege. Applications run in user mode with limited access. The kernel operates in kernel mode with complete control. When adversaries break that barrier, they’ve gained access to what many security researchers consider the holy grail of a systems and entire networks’ vulnerabilities.Ivanti&#x27;s new release directly addresses this reality. Connect Secure 25.X runs on an enterprise-grade Oracle Linux operating system with strong Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enforcement that can limit a threat actor&#x27;s abilities within the system. The solution includes Secure Boot protection, disk encryption, key management, secure factory reset, a modern secure web server, and Web Application Firewall (WAF), all designed to secure key aspects of the system and significantly deter external threats.\"In the past year, we&#x27;ve significantly advanced our Secure by Design strategy, translating our commitment into real action through substantial investments and an expanded security team,\" Riemer explained. \"This release stands as tangible evidence of our commitment. We listened to our customers, invested in both technology and talent, and modernized the security of Ivanti Connect Secure to provide the resilience and peace of mind our customers expect and deserve.\"From OS rings to Deployment Rings: A more complete defense strategyWhile operating system rings define privilege levels, modern patch management has adopted its own ring strategy to combat the 72-hour exploit window. Ring deployment provides a phased, automated patching strategy that rolls out updates incrementally: a Test Ring for core IT validation, an Early Adopter Ring for compatibility testing, and a Production Ring for enterprise-wide rollout.This approach directly addresses the speed crisis. Ring deployment achieves 99% patch success within 24 hours for up to 100,000 PCs, according to Gartner research. Ponemon Institute research shows organizations take an alarming average of 43 days to detect cyberattacks even after a patch is released.Jesse Miller, SVP and director of IT at Southstar Bank, emphasized: \"When judging how impactful something can be, you have to take everything from current events, your industry, your environment and more into the equation.\" His team uses ring deployment to reduce their attack surface as quickly as possible.Attackers aggressively exploit legacy vulnerabilities with 76% of vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware were reported between 2010 and 2019. When kernel access is at stake, every hour of delay multiplies the risk exponentially.The Kernel Dilemma centers on balancing security versus stabilityAt CrowdStrike&#x27;s FalCon conference, Chief Technology Innovation Officer Alex Ionescu laid out the problem: \"By now, it&#x27;s clear that if you want to protect against bad actors, you need to operate in the kernel. But to do that, the reliability of your machine is put at risk.\"The industry is responding with fundamental shifts:Microsoft&#x27;s WISP mandates multi-year changes for every Windows security vendorLinux embraced eBPF for safer kernel instrumentationApple&#x27;s Endpoint Security Framework enables user-mode operationAuthentication bypass happens when kernels are compromised AmberWolf researchers spent seven months analyzing ZTNA products. Zscaler failed to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2024-54982). Netskope&#x27;s authentication could be bypassed using non-revocable OrgKey values. Check Point had hard-coded SFTP keys (CVE-2025-3831).These vulnerabilities existed for months. Some vendors patched quietly without CVEs. As of August 2025, 16 months after disclosure, many organizations still used exploitable configurations.Lessons learned from compressing 3 years of kernel security into 18 months When nation-state attackers exploited Ivanti Connect Secure in January 2024, it validated Ivanti’s decision to rapidly advance its kernel-level security strategy, compressing a three-year project into just 18 months. As Riemer explained, \"We had already completed phase one of the kernel-hardening project before the attack. That allowed us to quickly pivot and accelerate our roadmap.”Key accomplishments included:Migration to 64-bit Oracle Linux: Ivanti replaced an outdated 32-bit CentOS OS with Oracle Linux 9, significantly reducing known vulnerabilities tied to legacy open-source components.Custom SELinux enforcement: Implementing strict SELinux policies initially broke a significant number of product features, requiring careful refactoring without compromising security parameters. The resulting solution now runs in permanent enforcement mode, Riemer explained. Process de-privileging and secure boot with TPM: Ivanti eliminated root privileges from critical processes and integrated TPM-based secure boot and RSA encryption, ensuring continuous integrity checks, aligning with AmberWolf’s research recommendations and findings.There were also a series of independent penetration testing initiatives, and each confirmed zero successful compromises, with threat actors typically abandoning attempts within three days.

          "standfirst": "We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but most of them don’t come cheap. To help you get the most value possible, we’re keeping a constant eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.This week has been a particularly fruitful time to be in the market for an Apple tablet: Amazon held its latest Prime Day sale on October 7-8, while other retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart are still running sweeping sales of their own. A number of Apple device discounts from these events are still available today, including the base iPad (A16) for $279 and a $150 drop for the iPad Air. Beyond iPads, other gadgets like the AirPods 4, MacBook Air and AirTag remain heavily discounted as well. Here are all the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. We saw the base model drop as low as $437 during Amazon's Prime Day sale this week, but this $150 discount ties the best price we've seen otherwise. Other configurations are also $150 off. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart but is otherwise the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for multitasking or just taking in movies. This discount is an all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The 8.3-inch iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. The newest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — alongside 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. You’d buy it if you want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. We saw it available for $20 less during Amazon's Prime Day sale, but this is still a decent drop from its typical going rate. Also at Best Buy. Best Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): If you don't need ANC, the standard AirPods 4 are still a good buy for those who hate the feeling of pairs that jut into their ear canal. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass response as traditional in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs of this type, and they still offer a host of Apple-friendly features. This is another all-time low. Also at Walmart, or Best Buy for $1 more. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s lowest-ever price, but it’s the biggest drop we’ve seen since July. Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

This technique (called speculative decoding) has become essential for enterprises trying to reduce inference costs and latency. Instead of generating tokens one at a time, the system can accept multiple tokens at once, dramatically improving throughput.Together AI today announced research and a new system called ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) that aims to help enterprises overcome the challenge of static speculators. The technique provides a self-learning inference optimization capability that can help to deliver up to 400% faster inference performance than a baseline level of performance available in existing inference technologies such as vLLM.. The system addresses a critical problem: as AI workloads evolve, inference speeds degrade, even with specialized speculators in place.The company which got its start in 2023, has been focused on optimizing inference on its enterprise AI platform. Earlier this year the company raised $305 million as customer adoption and demand has grown.\"Companies we work with generally, as they scale up, they see shifting workloads, and then they don&#x27;t see as much speedup from speculative execution as before,\" Tri Dao, chief scientist at Together AI, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"These speculators generally don&#x27;t work well when their workload domain starts to shift.\"The workload drift problem no one talks aboutMost speculators in production today are \"static\" models. They&#x27;re trained once on a fixed dataset representing expected workloads, then deployed without any ability to adapt. Companies like Meta and Mistral ship pre-trained speculators alongside their main models. Inference platforms like vLLM use these static speculators to boost throughput without changing output quality.But there&#x27;s a catch. When an enterprise&#x27;s AI usage evolves the static speculator&#x27;s accuracy plummets.\"If you&#x27;re a company producing coding agents, and most of your developers have been writing in Python, all of a sudden some of them switch to writing Rust or C, then you see the speed starts to go down,\" Dao explained. \"The speculator has a mismatch between what it was trained on versus what the actual workload is.\"This workload drift represents a hidden tax on scaling AI. Enterprises either accept degraded performance or invest in retraining custom speculators. That process captures only a snapshot in time and quickly becomes outdated.How adaptive speculators work: A dual-model approachATLAS uses a dual-speculator architecture that combines stability with adaptation:The static speculator - A heavyweight model trained on broad data provides consistent baseline performance. It serves as a \"speed floor.\"The adaptive speculator - A lightweight model learns continuously from live traffic. It specializes on-the-fly to emerging domains and usage patterns.The confidence-aware controller - An orchestration layer dynamically chooses which speculator to use. It adjusts the speculation \"lookahead\" based on confidence scores.\"Before the adaptive speculator learns anything, we still have the static speculator to help provide the speed boost in the beginning,\" Ben Athiwaratkun, staff AI scientist at Together AI explained to VentureBeat. \"Once the adaptive speculator becomes more confident, then the speed grows over time.\"The technical innovation lies in balancing acceptance rate (how often the target model agrees with drafted tokens) and draft latency. As the adaptive model learns from traffic patterns, the controller relies more on the lightweight speculator and extends lookahead. This compounds performance gains.Users don&#x27;t need to tune any parameters. \"On the user side, users don&#x27;t have to turn any knobs,\" Dao said. \"On our side, we have turned these knobs for users to adjust in a configuration that gets good speedup.\"Performance that rivals custom siliconTogether AI&#x27;s testing shows ATLAS reaching 500 tokens per second on DeepSeek-V3.1 when fully adapted.

When a model generates one token at a time, it&#x27;s memory-bound. The GPU sits idle while waiting for memory. But when the speculator proposes five tokens and the target model verifies them simultaneously, compute utilization spikes while memory access remains roughly constant.\"The total amount of compute to generate five tokens is the same, but you only had to access memory once, instead of five times,\" Dao said.Think of it as intelligent caching for AIFor infrastructure teams familiar with traditional database optimization, adaptive speculators function like an intelligent caching layer, but with a crucial difference.Traditional caching systems like Redis or memcached require exact matches. You store the exact same query result and retrieve it when that specific query runs again. Adaptive speculators work differently.\"You can view it as an intelligent way of caching, not storing exactly, but figuring out some patterns that you see,\" Dao explained. \"Broadly, we&#x27;re observing that you&#x27;re working with similar code, or working with similar, you know, controlling compute in a similar way. We can then predict what the big model is going to say. We just get better and better at predicting that.\"Rather than storing exact responses, the system learns patterns in how the model generates tokens. It recognizes that if you&#x27;re editing Python files in a specific codebase, certain token sequences become more likely.

          "standfirst": "It seems like almost every week for the last two years since ChatGPT launched, new large language models (LLMs) from rival labs or from OpenAI itself have been released. Enterprises are hard pressed to keep up with the massive pace of change, let alone understand how to adapt to it — which of these new models should they adopt, if any, to power their workflows and the custom AI agents they&#x27;re building to carry them out? Help has arrived: AI applications observability startup Raindrop has launched Experiments, a new analytics feature that the company describes as the first A/B testing suite designed specifically for enterprise AI agents — allowing companies to see and compare how updating agents to new underlying models, or changing their instructions and tool access, will impact their performance with real end users. The release extends Raindrop’s existing observability tools, giving developers and teams a way to see how their agents behave and evolve in real-world conditions.With Experiments, teams can track how changes — such as a new tool, prompt, model update, or full pipeline refactor — affect AI performance across millions of user interactions. The new feature is available now for users on Raindrop’s Pro subscription plan ($350 monthly) at raindrop.ai. A Data-Driven Lens on Agent DevelopmentRaindrop co-founder and chief technology officer Ben Hylak noted in a product announcement video (above) that Experiments helps teams see “how literally anything changed,” including tool usage, user intents, and issue rates, and to explore differences by demographic factors such as language. The goal is to make model iteration more transparent and measurable.The Experiments interface presents results visually, showing when an experiment performs better or worse than its baseline. Increases in negative signals might indicate higher task failure or partial code output, while improvements in positive signals could reflect more complete responses or better user experiences.By making this data easy to interpret, Raindrop encourages AI teams to approach agent iteration with the same rigor as modern software deployment—tracking outcomes, sharing insights, and addressing regressions before they compound.Background: From AI Observability to ExperimentationRaindrop’s launch of Experiments builds on the company’s foundation as one of the first AI-native observability platforms, designed to help enterprises monitor and understand how their generative AI systems behave in production. As VentureBeat reported earlier this year, the company — originally known as Dawn AI — emerged to address what Hylak, a former Apple human interface designer, called the “black box problem” of AI performance, helping teams catch failures “as they happen and explain to enterprises what went wrong and why.\" At the time, Hylak described how “AI products fail constantly—in ways both hilarious and terrifying,” noting that unlike traditional software, which throws clear exceptions, “AI products fail silently.” Raindrop’s original platform focused on detecting those silent failures by analyzing signals such as user feedback, task failures, refusals, and other conversational anomalies across millions of daily events.The company’s co-founders— Hylak, Alexis Gauba, and Zubin Singh Koticha — built Raindrop after encountering firsthand the difficulty of debugging AI systems in production. “We started by building AI products, not infrastructure,” Hylak told VentureBeat. “But pretty quickly, we saw that to grow anything serious, we needed tooling to understand AI behavior—and that tooling didn’t exist.”With Experiments, Raindrop extends that same mission from detecting failures to measuring improvements. The new tool transforms observability data into actionable comparisons, letting enterprises test whether changes to their models, prompts, or pipelines actually make their AI agents better—or just different.Solving the “Evals Pass, Agents Fail” ProblemTraditional evaluation frameworks, while useful for benchmarking, rarely capture the unpredictable behavior of AI agents operating in dynamic environments. As Raindrop co-founder Alexis Gauba explained in her LinkedIn announcement, “Traditional evals don’t really answer this question. They’re great unit tests, but you can’t predict your user’s actions and your agent is running for hours, calling hundreds of tools.”Gauba said the company consistently heard a common frustration from teams: “Evals pass, agents fail.”Experiments is meant to close that gap by showing what actually changes when developers ship updates to their systems. The tool enables side-by-side comparisons of models, tools, intents, or properties, surfacing measurable differences in behavior and performance.Designed for Real-World AI BehaviorIn the announcement video, Raindrop described Experiments as a way to “compare anything and measure how your agent’s behavior actually changed in production across millions of real interactions.”The platform helps users spot issues such as task failure spikes, forgetting, or new tools that trigger unexpected errors. It can also be used in reverse — starting from a known problem, such as an “agent stuck in a loop,” and tracing back to which model, tool, or flag is driving it. From there, developers can dive into detailed traces to find the root cause and ship a fix quickly.Each experiment provides a visual breakdown of metrics like tool usage frequency, error rates, conversation duration, and response length. Users can click on any comparison to access the underlying event data, giving them a clear view of how agent behavior changed over time. Shared links make it easy to collaborate with teammates or report findings.Integration, Scalability, and AccuracyAccording to Hylak, Experiments integrates directly with “the feature flag platforms companies know and love (like Statsig!)” and is designed to work seamlessly with existing telemetry and analytics pipelines. For companies without those integrations, it can still compare performance over time—such as yesterday versus today—without additional setup.Hylak said teams typically need around 2,000 users per day to produce statistically meaningful results. To ensure the accuracy of comparisons, Experiments monitors for sample size adequacy and alerts users if a test lacks enough data to draw valid conclusions.“We obsess over making sure metrics like Task Failure and User Frustration are metrics that you’d wake up an on-call engineer for,” Hylak explained. He added that teams can drill into the specific conversations or events that drive those metrics, ensuring transparency behind every aggregate number.Security and Data ProtectionRaindrop operates as a cloud-hosted platform but also offers on-premise personally identifiable information (PII) redaction for enterprises that need additional control. Hylak said the company is SOC 2 compliant and has launched a PII Guard feature that uses AI to automatically remove sensitive information from stored data. “We take protecting customer data very seriously,” he emphasized.Pricing and PlansExperiments is part of Raindrop’s Pro plan, which costs $350 per month or $0.0007 per interaction. The Pro tier also includes deep research tools, topic clustering, custom issue tracking, and semantic search capabilities.Raindrop’s Starter plan — $65 per month or $0.001 per interaction — offers core analytics including issue detection, user feedback signals, Slack alerts, and user tracking. Both plans come with a 14-day free trial.Larger organizations can opt for an Enterprise plan with custom pricing and advanced features like SSO login, custom alerts, integrations, edge-PII redaction, and priority support.Continuous Improvement for AI SystemsWith Experiments, Raindrop positions itself at the intersection of AI analytics and software observability. Its focus on “measure truth,” as stated in the product video, reflects a broader push within the industry toward accountability and transparency in AI operations.Rather than relying solely on offline benchmarks, Raindrop’s approach emphasizes real user data and contextual understanding. The company hopes this will allow AI developers to move faster, identify root causes sooner, and ship better-performing models with confidence.",

As VentureBeat reported earlier this year, the company — originally known as Dawn AI — emerged to address what Hylak, a former Apple human interface designer, called the “black box problem” of AI performance, helping teams catch failures “as they happen and explain to enterprises what went wrong and why.\" At the time, Hylak described how “AI products fail constantly—in ways both hilarious and terrifying,” noting that unlike traditional software, which throws clear exceptions, “AI products fail silently.” Raindrop’s original platform focused on detecting those silent failures by analyzing signals such as user feedback, task failures, refusals, and other conversational anomalies across millions of daily events.The company’s co-founders— Hylak, Alexis Gauba, and Zubin Singh Koticha — built Raindrop after encountering firsthand the difficulty of debugging AI systems in production. “We started by building AI products, not infrastructure,” Hylak told VentureBeat. “But pretty quickly, we saw that to grow anything serious, we needed tooling to understand AI behavior—and that tooling didn’t exist.”With Experiments, Raindrop extends that same mission from detecting failures to measuring improvements. The new tool transforms observability data into actionable comparisons, letting enterprises test whether changes to their models, prompts, or pipelines actually make their AI agents better—or just different.Solving the “Evals Pass, Agents Fail” ProblemTraditional evaluation frameworks, while useful for benchmarking, rarely capture the unpredictable behavior of AI agents operating in dynamic environments. As Raindrop co-founder Alexis Gauba explained in her LinkedIn announcement, “Traditional evals don’t really answer this question. They’re great unit tests, but you can’t predict your user’s actions and your agent is running for hours, calling hundreds of tools.”Gauba said the company consistently heard a common frustration from teams: “Evals pass, agents fail.”Experiments is meant to close that gap by showing what actually changes when developers ship updates to their systems. The tool enables side-by-side comparisons of models, tools, intents, or properties, surfacing measurable differences in behavior and performance.Designed for Real-World AI BehaviorIn the announcement video, Raindrop described Experiments as a way to “compare anything and measure how your agent’s behavior actually changed in production across millions of real interactions.”The platform helps users spot issues such as task failure spikes, forgetting, or new tools that trigger unexpected errors. It can also be used in reverse — starting from a known problem, such as an “agent stuck in a loop,” and tracing back to which model, tool, or flag is driving it. From there, developers can dive into detailed traces to find the root cause and ship a fix quickly.Each experiment provides a visual breakdown of metrics like tool usage frequency, error rates, conversation duration, and response length. Users can click on any comparison to access the underlying event data, giving them a clear view of how agent behavior changed over time. Shared links make it easy to collaborate with teammates or report findings.Integration, Scalability, and AccuracyAccording to Hylak, Experiments integrates directly with “the feature flag platforms companies know and love (like Statsig!)” and is designed to work seamlessly with existing telemetry and analytics pipelines. For companies without those integrations, it can still compare performance over time—such as yesterday versus today—without additional setup.Hylak said teams typically need around 2,000 users per day to produce statistically meaningful results. To ensure the accuracy of comparisons, Experiments monitors for sample size adequacy and alerts users if a test lacks enough data to draw valid conclusions.“We obsess over making sure metrics like Task Failure and User Frustration are metrics that you’d wake up an on-call engineer for,” Hylak explained. He added that teams can drill into the specific conversations or events that drive those metrics, ensuring transparency behind every aggregate number.Security and Data ProtectionRaindrop operates as a cloud-hosted platform but also offers on-premise personally identifiable information (PII) redaction for enterprises that need additional control. Hylak said the company is SOC 2 compliant and has launched a PII Guard feature that uses AI to automatically remove sensitive information from stored data. “We take protecting customer data very seriously,” he emphasized.Pricing and PlansExperiments is part of Raindrop’s Pro plan, which costs $350 per month or $0.0007 per interaction. The Pro tier also includes deep research tools, topic clustering, custom issue tracking, and semantic search capabilities.Raindrop’s Starter plan — $65 per month or $0.001 per interaction — offers core analytics including issue detection, user feedback signals, Slack alerts, and user tracking. Both plans come with a 14-day free trial.Larger organizations can opt for an Enterprise plan with custom pricing and advanced features like SSO login, custom alerts, integrations, edge-PII redaction, and priority support.Continuous Improvement for AI SystemsWith Experiments, Raindrop positions itself at the intersection of AI analytics and software observability. Its focus on “measure truth,” as stated in the product video, reflects a broader push within the industry toward accountability and transparency in AI operations.Rather than relying solely on offline benchmarks, Raindrop’s approach emphasizes real user data and contextual understanding. The company hopes this will allow AI developers to move faster, identify root causes sooner, and ship better-performing models with confidence.",

The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks. Table of contents Best smartwatches for 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Other smartwatches our experts tested Smartwatch FAQs Best smartwatches of 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Fossil Yes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please. Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Compatibility Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone. The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things. Price The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials. Battery life Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates. Communication Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now. Fitness tracking Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well. Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more. Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Music Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds. Displays Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives. You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again. NFC Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth. Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems. Other smartwatches our experts tested Apple Watch Ultra 3 The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple Watch SE 3 The Apple Watch SE 3 is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay. Amazfit Bip 6 The Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably. The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily. We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere). Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter Smartwatch FAQs Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker? While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes. A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind. A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice. How long do smartwatches last? How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability. Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster. Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support. You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary. How much should you spend on a smartwatch? How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it. If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two. High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.

We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay. Amazfit Bip 6 The Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably. The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily. We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere). Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter Smartwatch FAQs Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker? While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes. A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind. A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice. How long do smartwatches last? How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability. Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster. Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support. You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary. How much should you spend on a smartwatch? How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it. If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two. High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.

          "standfirst": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a new technique that flips the script on how large language models (LLMs) learn to reason. The method, called reinforcement learning pre-training (RLP), integrates RL into the initial training phase rather than saving it for the end.This approach encourages the model to “think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining,” the researchers state in their paper. By learning to reason on plain text without needing external verifiers, models trained with RLP show significant improvements in learning complex reasoning tasks downstream, hinting at a future of more capable and adaptable AI for real-world tasks.The typical LLM training cycleTypically, large language models are first pre-trained on vast amounts of text using a \"next-token prediction\" objective, where they are given a string of text and asked to continuously guess what the next word (or token) will be. In this phase, they learn grammar, facts, and basic associations.In the later post-training phase, models usually learn complex reasoning abilities such as chain-of-thought (CoT) where a model lays out its reasoning step-by-step. This stage often involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which require specialized, curated datasets.The paper’s authors argue this sequential process does not match human comprehension, which is “not a linear token-by-token process, but rather a parallel integration of input with prior knowledge.” Existing pre-training methods lack this mechanism, hindering a model&#x27;s ability to develop deep reasoning from the start.How reinforcement learning pre-training worksRLP reframes this process by treating CoT generation as an action the model takes before predicting the next token. At each step, the model first generates an internal \"thought\" or reasoning chain. It then predicts the next word in the text, using the original context augmented with its new thought.The model receives a reward based on how much its thought improved the accuracy of its prediction compared to a baseline that didn&#x27;t generate a thought (pure next-token prediction). This reward signal is calculated automatically based on the change in probability, eliminating the need for external verifiers or human-labeled data. The reward is positive only when the generated thought helps the model better predict the next token. By rewarding thoughts based on their predictive benefit, RLP effectively teaches the model how to think usefully on the same massive, unstructured datasets used for standard pre-training. This continuous feedback loop allows the model to learn when a simple predictive guess is sufficient and when it needs to engage in deeper reasoning. As the researchers put it, “RLP is designed to shape thinking in base models by rewarding only those thoughts that measurably help next-token prediction.”This foundational approach, however, doesn&#x27;t make later fine-tuning stages obsolete. According to Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research at Nvidia and a co-author of the paper, RLP is designed to complement, not replace, these crucial steps. \"RLP isn’t meant to replace the later post-training stages like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback,\" Catanzaro told VentureBeat. \"Those stages remain crucial for refining model behavior... It’s really designed to amplify the effectiveness of those later phases by giving the model a head start.\"RLP in actionIn experiments with Qwen3-1.7B and Nemotron-Nano-12B, Nvidia’s team tested RLP across a suite of math and science reasoning benchmarks. The results show that models enhanced with RLP consistently outperformed their conventionally trained counterparts, with particularly strong gains in reasoning-heavy tasks. For an enterprise, this improved reasoning could translate to more reliable outputs in multi-step workflows like financial analysis or legal document summarization.\"RLP encourages the model during pretraining to think before it predicts, helping the model internalize a more coherent reasoning style,\" said Catanzaro. \"This could help reduce subtle logical errors, especially in longer workflows.” While stressing that RLP-trained models will still need the usual guardrails such as verification layers, human oversight, and consistency checks, Catanzaro said that “RLP gives you a stronger baseline.\"Importantly, the benefits of RLP compound instead of disappearing during subsequent fine-tuning stages (catastrophic forgetting is a common problem in LLM training, where later training stages cause the model to forget its previously learned skills and knowledge). The RLP-trained model achieved an overall score that was 7-8% higher than baselines after an identical post-training regimen. The researchers conclude that RLP “establishes robust reasoning foundations that are not washed out by downstream alignment but instead compound with post-training.”The efficiency of the technique is a key finding. On the Qwen3-1.7B model, RLP improved performance by 17% over standard continuous pre-training and also beat a similar technique called Reinforcement Pretraining via prefix-matching rewards (RPT). This advantage held even when the baseline model was trained with 35 times more data to match the computational cost, confirming the gains come from the method itself, not just more processing.Furthermore, RLP demonstrates impressive scalability and versatility, successfully extracting a reasoning signal from general-purpose web data—not just curated datasets. When applied to the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model Nemotron-Nano-12B, RLP achieved a 35% relative improvement over a heavily trained baseline while using just a tiny fraction of the data.While these results point toward a more efficient path for building powerful models, Catanzaro frames the innovation as a fundamental shift in the learning process itself, rather than an immediate solution to high training costs. \"This research is exciting because it offers a shift in how models absorb information during pretraining leading to a smarter learning process,\" he explained. \"It wouldn’t replace large-scale pretraining, but offer another creative method in building the best possible models.\"A new foundation for AI trainingUltimately, RLP points toward a future where pre-training is no longer a monolithic process of next-token prediction. Instead, the next generation of models could be built on a hybrid of objectives, creating AI that learns to think more robustly from day one. Catanzaro offers a powerful analogy to frame this shift:\"Next-token prediction teaches a model what the world looks like; reinforcement-style objectives like RLP can teach it how to think about what it’s seeing,\" he said. \"The combination of these two objectives could help models develop deeper, more structured thinking much earlier in training... Tools like RLP can build on top of that foundation, making learning more active, curious, and even more efficient.\"There is still a lot to learn about the dynamics of reinforcement learning in the pre-training phase, but what seems clear is that “introducing exploration earlier in training opens a new axis for scaling — not just in size, but in how models learn to reason,” Catanzaro said.",

The country's antitrust regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has confirmed that Google has \"strategic market status,\" paving the way to more limits on how Google does business in the UK. Naturally, Google objects to this course of action. The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding \"yes.\" This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation.

          "content": "Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week announced its newest stunt: a \"Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke\" edition that ditches the game's rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project \"informational material\" rather than a \"game,\" and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship. While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be? In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).Read full article Comments",

Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware. The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward.\"Read full article Comments",

Baron Zemo (Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum.

Now that we're nearly five full years into the PS5 era, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls \"a future console in a few years' time.\" In a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about \"Project Amethyst,\" a co-engineering effort between both companies that was also teased back in July. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the \"results are quite promising\" for a project that's still in the \"early days.\" Mo’ ML, fewer problems? Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to \"brute force that with raw power alone,\" Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind AMD's FSR upscaling technology and Sony's similar PSSR system.Read full article Comments",

You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it. Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine-learning tools. These machine-learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities.

The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size.

On the right tires, it could show a VW Golf GTI a thing or two, and while it might have been slow-charging, it could still be a decent road-tripper. All of this helped the Bolt become General Motors' best-selling EV, at least until its used-to-be-called Ultium platform got up and running. And that's despite a costly recall that required replacing batteries in tens of thousands of Bolts because of some badly folded cells. But GM had other plans for the Bolt's factory, and in 2023, it announced its impending death. The reaction from EV enthusiasts, and Bolt owners in particular, was so overwhelmingly negative that just a few months later, GM CEO Mary Barra backtracked, promising to bring the Bolt back, this time with a don't-call-it-Ultium-anymore battery.Read full article Comments",

Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement.

There, the fungi break down the tough plant fibers, making them accessible for the termites in an elaborate form of symbiotic agriculture. Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices. Going blind Termites do not look like particularly good gardeners at first glance. They are effectively blind, which is not that surprising considering they spend most of their life in complete darkness working in endless corridors of their mounds. But termites make up for their lack of sight with other senses. \"They can detect the environment based on advanced olfactory reception and touch, and I think this is what they use to identify the weeds in their gardens,\" Raychoudhury says. To learn how termites react once they detect a weed infestation, his team collected some Odontotermes obesus and challenged them with different gardening problems.Read full article Comments",
