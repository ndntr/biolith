          "title": "Bowers & Wilkins Px8 S2 review: Headphone extravagance",
          "standfirst": "There’s a fine line between luxurious and ludicrous. When you’re talking about a pair of $799 headphones, that line begins to blur. Bowers & Wilkins has been on an excellent run of form over the past few years, consistently offering some of the best sound quality you’ll find on any headphones. It doesn’t load its models down with features — sometimes it could use a few more — but there’s always a great blend of design, audio performance and capable active noise cancellation (ANC) that make for well-rounded products. And then there’s the Px8 S2. At $799, it’s $100 more expensive than its predecessor (the Px8) was at launch, which puts them even further out of reach for most. Bowers & Wilkins did change up its familiar design slightly, and there’s a big improvement to audio performance, the addition of high-res music over USB-C and improved call quality. There’s no doubt the Px8 S2 is beyond premium, but did the company go too far? What’s new on the Px8 S2? After several generations of the Px7 and Px8 that had pretty much the same design, Bowers & Wilkins changed things up a bit with the Px8 S2. There isn't a comprehensive redesign here, but the slimmer ear cup silhouette and the exposed cabling on the headband yokes are notable improvements to the overall look. Once again, the company opted for a mix of soft leather and die-cast aluminum, both of which give the Px8 S2 a decidedly high-end aesthetic. Inside, new 40mm carbon cone dynamic drivers were updated with a new chassis and motor. Those components are powered by 24-bit DSP (digital signal processing) with a dedicated amplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). There’s also a more robust five-band EQ with True Sound bypass, which allows you to disable any equalizer tweaks to quickly return to Bowers & Wilkins’ stock tuning. The company added aptX Lossless support on top of the existing aptX Adaptive availability, and you can get “true” lossless — 24-bit/96kHz — sound quality over USB-C. Compared to the previous model, the Px8 S2 has two more microphones, bringing the total to eight. Six of those are used for external monitoring for ANC while two keep tabs on noise inside the headphones. All eight are used during calls, in addition to an upgraded “pure voice” algorithm to improve performance there. You can also hear yourself better in transparency mode, which is the biggest boost to calls. What’s still good on the Px8 S2? The Px8 S2 has some subtle, but welcome design changes. Billy Steele for Engadget Bowers & Wilkins has excelled at crafting a warm, inviting and immersive sound profile across its headphones for a while now. That’s still the case on the Px8 S2 as the audio quality is rich and detailed, with a wide soundstage that envelops you — almost to the point of bombarding your ears. While I don’t think the bass tuning is well-suited for mellow genres, there’s plenty to like here. On albums like Jason Isbell’s Foxes in the Snow, for example, the amount of texture and subtle nuance where the only instruments are the singer’s voice and a single acoustic guitar is incredible. Reliable battery life has been a strong point for the company in the past, and that remains true on the Px8 S2. The 30-hour battery figure (ANC on) is the same as the previous model, and I was able to easily achieve that longevity during my testing. With a mix of active noise cancellation, high-res tunes and transparency mode for work calls, the headphones easily kept up with Bowers & Wilkins’ promised numbers. What’s not so good about the Px8 S2? The Px8 S2's controls are tiny buttons in awkward locations. Billy Steele for Engadget The biggest knock against the Px8 S2 is the price. These headphones are way more expensive than what most companies charge for their top-of-the-line models, which is around $500 these days. Sure, $799 is only $50 more than the tariff-adjusted rate for the Px8 (which was originally $699), and there are several upgrades here, but that price will be prohibitively expensive for many, thus making the S2 harder to recommend despite their strengths. Even with the upgraded sound, I feel like Bowers & Wilkins may have gone too far with the bass tuning. There is some absolutely booming low-end tone on display here, especially for bass-heavy genres like rock, metal, EDM and hip-hop. On Spiritbox’s “Perfect Soul,” as one example, the kick drum edges dangerously close to drowning out the lead and bass guitars. A bit more restraint here would’ve provided ample thump and depth that isn’t almost exhausting to listen to. At times, the enhanced bass is great, but at others, like on Ruston Kelly’s Pale, Through the Window, it can really be too much for the style of music. On its recent headphones, Bowers & Wilkins relocated the physical controls from sitting on the edge of their ear cups to a ridge on the outside. In the process, the company also made the buttons much smaller. As I said when I reviewed the Px7 S3, this makes the controls harder to find with your thumbs, and you also have to be more accurate with your presses. That’s especially true for the three-button array on the right side that handles volume changes and playback controls. Like it did with its previous headphone models, Bowers & Wilkins hasn’t packed the Px8 S2’s spec sheet with advanced features. You do get a couple of basic items — multipoint Bluetooth and wear detection/automatic pausing — but things like speech recognition, hands-free assistants or automatic sound profiles aren’t here. This is an area where the likes of Sony, Bose and Sennheiser surpass Bowers & Wilkins, even though products like the Px8 S2 typically offer superior sound quality. Wrap-up The Px8 S2 offers a few notable upgrades over the Px8. Billy Steele for Engadget So how well does Bowers & Wilkins straddle that line between luxury and ludicrousness? I’d say the Px8 S2 is a luxurious set of headphones with a ludicrous price. I fully understand that Bowers & Wilkins is a high-end audio brand and that its products typically demand a premium over most of the competition. But like I already said, the price puts these excellent headphones out of reach. When you consider the price tag alongside the lack of advanced features, the Px8 S2 becomes hard to recommend. But for those who can afford them, a tantalizing symphony of sound awaits.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/bowers--wilkins-px8-s2-review-headphone-extravagance-193000794.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "We generally think Apple’s iPads are the best tablets for most people, but they don’t come cheap. To help those looking to grab one today get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.This week’s selection includes the return of a $100 price drop for the iPad mini, along with a $50 discount for the entry-level iPad and early discounts on the recently updated iPad Pro. Beyond tablets, the MacBook Air, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 have all dropped to new all-time lows, while a four-pack of AirTags is also steeply discounted at $65. It’s worth remembering that official Black Friday sales are just around the corner, so we expect to see more deals in the days and weeks ahead. But if you can’t hold out a little longer, here are all the top deals on Apple gear that we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $945 ($54 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's already $50 or so off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage is down to a slightly less pricey $945. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $949. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,247 ($52 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($50 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Just note that this deal only applies to the Starlight finish as of this writing. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS) for $280 ($119 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the new Apple Watch Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the Series 10: The battery lasts a little longer, the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash and still need the more advanced health features the SE lacks — such as an ECG app and hypertension alerts — this is the best discount we've seen for last year’s model. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target.

To help those looking to grab one today get the most value possible, we’re keeping an eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.This week’s selection includes the return of a $100 price drop for the iPad mini, along with a $50 discount for the entry-level iPad and early discounts on the recently updated iPad Pro. Beyond tablets, the MacBook Air, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 have all dropped to new all-time lows, while a four-pack of AirTags is also steeply discounted at $65. It’s worth remembering that official Black Friday sales are just around the corner, so we expect to see more deals in the days and weeks ahead. But if you can’t hold out a little longer, here are all the top deals on Apple gear that we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for much of the past several months — it's $20 above the tablet's all-time low, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target. Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M5) for $945 ($54 off): Apple's newest iPad only came out less than a month ago, but it's already $50 or so off at various retailers. At Amazon, the base model with an M5 chip and 256GB of storage is down to a slightly less pricey $945. We gave this iPad Pro a score of 85 in our review. It has a class-leading OLED display and an impressively thin design, while the new M5 chip is more than powerful enough to do just about anything you'd want to do with an iPad. It's the only Apple tablet to support fast charging, too. That said, it's still far more iPad than casual buyers ever need, so it's best suited for hardcore iPad users and those with cash to burn. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $949. Apple iPad Pro (13-inch, M5) for $1,247 ($52 off): The 13-inch iPad Pro is virtually the same as the 11-inch version, only it's bigger. It's also more expensive, but the extra screen space might be worth it if you're committed to using the Pro as your main computer. Amazon isn't listing this as a discount, but rest assured it's still about $50 off Apple's MSRP. Again, given that these tablets were just launched, any sort of price drop is worth noting. Also at Best Buy and B&H for $1,249. Best Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $750 ($250 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This is a new all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but higher-end configurations are also $250 off. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $950 ($250 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version; apart from its roomier display, it adds better speakers and a more spacious trackpad. This deal marks another all-time low, and other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Walmart. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($50 off): This is the first major discount we've seen for the third-gen version of Apple's entry-level smartwatch, which was released in September. The big upgrade here is the always-on display, which means you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. (This tech was previously limited to the more expensive Apple Watch models.) The watch now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings as well, plus it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it's a strong value. Just note that this deal only applies to the Starlight finish as of this writing. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS) for $280 ($119 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the new Apple Watch Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the Series 10: The battery lasts a little longer, the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support and that’s about it. If you’re mostly worried about saving cash and still need the more advanced health features the SE lacks — such as an ECG app and hypertension alerts — this is the best discount we've seen for last year’s model. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $700 ($100 off): The Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than Apple's other wearables, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gym-goer. It's the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. This discount doesn't make it cheap by any means, but it does represent a new low. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 before, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and Target.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $38 (16 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 (50 percent off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple iPad mini for $399 ($100 off): Apple's smallest tablet, the iPad mini is the best option for those who prefer their tablet be roughly the size of a paperback book. The latest model runs on the A17 Pro chipset and has an upgraded 128GB of storage in the base configuration. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Also available at Best Buy. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.

Apple's most affordable smartwatch is even cheaper right now, down to just $200.

While Black Friday sales can help with that, there are some great early deals running for anyone who wants to check off their list with time to spare. Take the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has only been out since late August. It's now down to $1,499 from $1,799 — a 17 percent discount. This deal is available at both Amazon and Best Buy, and seems to be the first big markdown on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Notably, this deal is on the 256GB model, but the 512GB and 1TB Pixel 10 Pro Folds are also $300 off. We gave the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold an 88 in our review, thanks to its improved durability, with an IP68 rating. It also has upgraded software and multitasking, along with Pixelsnap charging. Plus, we found it has the \"best cameras of any flexible phone.\" One of our biggest gripes is the price — though this discount certainly helps. It's also quite a bulky device and can feel pretty heavy. Other Google phones are also on sale for Black Friday right now. The Pixel 10 Pro has dropped to a record low of $749, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a whopping 1TB of storage is also cheaper than ever at $1,249.

          "standfirst": "EcoFlow is hosting an early Black Friday sale on portable power stations. This drops prices by up to 42 percent on many of its well-regarded products. For instance, the Delta Pro 3 is on sale for $2,299. This is a discount of 37 percent, as the typical cost is $3,699. That's a significant drop in price. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,599. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle. The Delta Pro 3 is just one of the products on sale right now. The Delta Pro Ultra, which is intended as a whole-home backup, is down to $3,999. This represents a savings of more than $2,000. Another Yahoo top pick, the Delta 2 Max, is $1,000 off and down to $899.

We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

          "title": "Anker Laptop Power Bank review: All my favorite battery features together at last",
          "standfirst": "Over the past couple years, I’ve tested around 60 different power banks for Engadget. In that time, battery manufacturers have given their products features with varying degrees of usefulness, ranging from smart (straps and built-in cables) to handy (displays and wireless charging pads) to really not necessary (Bluetooth connectivity, specialized recharging bases). Anker’s Laptop Power Bank (25K, 165W) manages to combine all the cleverest new features into one sleek-looking charging brick — and it costs less than some other banks in its class. There’s a built-in display that not only lets you know how much charge the bank has left, it also tells you how many watts are flowing through each port to your devices. Pressing the button on the side cycles through the battery’s current temperature and the overall health of the bank, including how many charge cycles it’s gone through. All of those bits of info should help prolong and gauge the bank’s longevity. Big capacity in a tidy package The 25,000 mAh capacity puts it well within the TSA’s 100Wh capacity limit and I have taken this battery on two flights in my carry-on with no issue. The capacity is enough to fill my tester smartphones (an iPhone 15 and a Galaxy S23 Ultra) around four times each. Separately, it pushed my aging 16-inch MacBook Pro from 10 percent to 78 percent. That translates to around nine additional hours of use for my typical workload (Wi-Fi, VPN, too many Chrome tabs and other basic productivity apps). My only gripe with the design is that the very shiny screen has become slightly dull with use. It doesn’t look bad, just not as mint-fresh as when it was unboxed. That’s to be expected, and I’ll take the luxe finish over some ruggedized enclosure any day. Two built-in cables and a big capacity let you charge two devices at once. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Sure, forget your cables at home Possibly the power bank’s most useful features are the two built-in USB-C cables, and one even loops around to create a handy carry strap. It feels robust and well-anchored enough that I don’t fear lugging it around like that. The other cable retracts into the unit and extends up to two feet when needed. The end stays neatly tucked into a well in the body and stays magnetically in place. The cords not only look tidy, their inclusion means you’ll never find yourself in the ironic position of having a dead device and a full battery pack, but no way to connect the two. Both cables serve in-out functions so you can easily plug them into any USB-C power adapter for a refill. There are also two additional USB (one Type-A and one Type-C) ports, so if you’ve got a specialized cable, such as Lightning, smartwatch or microUSB connector, you’ll be able to charge those devices too. Admirable speeds The 165-watt rating, as with any power bank, doesn't mean you’ll get that power out of a single port. The rating is a combined, almost theoretical total, achieved with all four ports engaged. The three USB-C outlets are rated at a max of 100W, but to get to that speed, you’ll need a device capable of taking it — my biggest energy hog is my laptop and it maxed out at around 90 watts using the power bank. But for all but the most extreme cases, that’s plenty fast. My tester iPhone 15 went from near-dead to 70 percent refilled in around 40 minutes. The Galaxy S23 Ultra powered up from five to 100 percent in under an hour, and my 16-inch MacBook got a 68 percent refill in just over 50 minutes. That’s not the fastest performance I’ve tested, but it’s better than most other banks and plenty quick enough to get you back in action in a decent amount of time. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Wrap-up It’s gratifying when, after years of testing one type of product, you get one that is, more or less, an ideal example of the category. This is the battery I grab when I’m heading to get some work done at the coffee shop. I’ve taken it with me on road trips and on flights, and it hasn’t let me down once. The fact that you don’t need to remember to grab a cable takes away an extra bit of stress, and the accurate display means you know just about how much more you can squeeze out of the bank's rather sizable depths.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html?src=rss",

The cords not only look tidy, their inclusion means you’ll never find yourself in the ironic position of having a dead device and a full battery pack, but no way to connect the two. Both cables serve in-out functions so you can easily plug them into any USB-C power adapter for a refill. There are also two additional USB (one Type-A and one Type-C) ports, so if you’ve got a specialized cable, such as Lightning, smartwatch or microUSB connector, you’ll be able to charge those devices too. Admirable speeds The 165-watt rating, as with any power bank, doesn't mean you’ll get that power out of a single port. The rating is a combined, almost theoretical total, achieved with all four ports engaged. The three USB-C outlets are rated at a max of 100W, but to get to that speed, you’ll need a device capable of taking it — my biggest energy hog is my laptop and it maxed out at around 90 watts using the power bank. But for all but the most extreme cases, that’s plenty fast. My tester iPhone 15 went from near-dead to 70 percent refilled in around 40 minutes. The Galaxy S23 Ultra powered up from five to 100 percent in under an hour, and my 16-inch MacBook got a 68 percent refill in just over 50 minutes. That’s not the fastest performance I’ve tested, but it’s better than most other banks and plenty quick enough to get you back in action in a decent amount of time. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Wrap-up It’s gratifying when, after years of testing one type of product, you get one that is, more or less, an ideal example of the category. This is the battery I grab when I’m heading to get some work done at the coffee shop. I’ve taken it with me on road trips and on flights, and it hasn’t let me down once. The fact that you don’t need to remember to grab a cable takes away an extra bit of stress, and the accurate display means you know just about how much more you can squeeze out of the bank's rather sizable depths.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/anker-laptop-power-bank-review-all-my-favorite-battery-features-together-at-last-130036854.html?src=rss",

Following a period where it briefly wasn't available to free users, you now don't even pay for one of OpenAI's subscriptions to use the tool. And while making images inside of ChatGPT is easy, there are some nuances worth explaining. For example, did you know you can ask ChatGPT to edit photos you've taken? It's more powerful than you might think. Here’s everything you need to know about generating AI images with ChatGPT. How to create images with ChatGPT using text prompts To begin making an image in ChatGPT, you can start by typing in the prompt bar. Igor Bonifacic for EngadgetTo begin generating images in ChatGPT, start typing in the prompt bar what you want to see. There's no need to overthink things; as long as you have some version of \"generate an image\" followed by a description of your idea, ChatGPT will do the rest. Depending on the complexity of your prompt, it may take up to two minutes for ChatGPT to complete your image request. Sometimes the process can take longer if OpenAI's servers are experiencing greater traffic than usual. How to create images with ChatGPT using existing photosYou can also upload images to ChatGPT.Igor Bonifacic for EngadgetIn addition to generating images from text prompts, ChatGPT can modify existing photos or images you upload. This is my preferred way of making images with ChatGPT; I don't need to describe the composition, I can use an existing one to guide the chatbot. To use a photo as a starting point for a new generation, follow these steps: Tap the \"+\" icon, located to the left of the prompt bar. Select Add photos & files. Select the image you want ChatGPT to edit. If uploading an image from your phone, you'll need to grant ChatGPT access to your camera roll. Write a prompt describing the changes you want. Keep in mind any photos you upload to OpenAI's servers may be used by the company to train future models. You can opt out of allowing your data to be used for training by following these steps: Open the sidebar menu. On mobile, tap the two lines on the top left of the interface. On desktop, click on the OpenAI logo.Tap your name to access account settings. Tap Data controls.Toggle off Improve the model for everyone. How to edit the images ChatGPT generatesChatGPT gives you a few different ways to modify an image to your liking. Igor Bonifacic for EngadgetIf you're unhappy with ChatGPT's output, you have two options. You can either prompt it to create an entirely new image, or edit parts of the picture it just generated. As before, you can simply write what changes you want to see in the prompt bar. OpenAI also gives users a few different shortcuts to accomplish the same task.To generate an entirely new image: On mobile, tap the two arrows icon below the image ChatGPT created. Select Try again, Add details or More concise. Alternatively, tap the image ChatGPT created and select Edit. Describe what you want ChatGPT to add, remove or replace through the prompt bar. To edit part of an existing image generation: Tap the image ChatGPT created. Tap Select. On desktop, instead click on the paintbrush icon on the top right. Use your finger to mask the section of the image you want ChatGPT to tweak. The slider on the left allows you to adjust the size of the masking brush. Describe what you want ChatGPT to add, remove or replace through the prompt bar. Like all AI systems, ChatGPT is non-deterministic, meaning even if you prompt it in the same way multiple times, it won't generate the exact same response each time. Tips to create better images with ChatGPTThe best advice I can offer is to be specific when prompting ChatGPT. The more detail you can provide when describing what you want from it, the better the results. And remember: ChatGPT can hallucinate — as you may have noticed from one of the example pictures I included above. In the image of the tortoiseshell cat, not only is the tortie not sitting on the window sill as instructed, it's sitting on a table that doesn't make much sense. So, most of all, be patient. Prompting an AI model is not exact science, and it can take a few tries before it creates the result you want. FAQsHow do you access ChatGPT?ChatGPT is available on the web, desktop and mobile. To access it on your computer, open your preferred browser and navigate to chatgpt.com. OpenAI also offers dedicated Mac and Windows apps you can download from the company's website. On iOS and Android, you'll need to download the ChatGPT app from either the App Store or Google Play before you can start using the chatbot. Since ChatGPT runs on OpenAI's servers, as long as you can access the chatbot, you'll be able to use it to create images no matter the age of your phone or computer. Can ChatGPT generate images for free? Yes, ChatGPT can generate images for free, as long as you have an OpenAI account. However, there is a daily rate cap and GPT-5 will take longer to make an image. Following March 27, 2025, OpenAI briefly limited free users to three image generations per day. The company has since relaxed that restriction, though it doesn't list a specific limit on its website. In my experience, you'll be able to generate about six to seven images every 24 hours. OpenAI's $20-per-month Plus plan offers \"expanded and faster image creation,\" while its $200-per-month Pro tier includes unlimited image generation as a perk. Can ChatGPT recreate an existing photo? No. For copyright reasons, ChatGPT can't replicate photos or exact real world events. For example, when I asked it to recreate the photo of Zinedine Zidane's iconic 2006 World Cup headbutt, ChatGPT refused. \"I can make an artistic reinterpretation inspired by the emotion or energy of that moment — for example, a stylized painting showing the tension and intensity of competition, without depicting real individuals,\" it told me.

          "standfirst": "Handheld gaming systems are having a moment. While people have been gaming on the go since the halcyon days of the Game Boy, recent years have brought an avalanche of devices that let you play all sorts of games anywhere you want. But new machines seem to arrive every week, and figuring out which ones are actually worth buying can be overwhelming. Depending on your tastes, the right handheld could be a $100 emulator or a $1,000 portable PC. To help you narrow things down, we’ve spent months researching the best handheld gaming consoles and testing several top contenders. Here are the ones we like the most right now.Editor’s note (11/7/25): A barrage of new mobile emulation handhelds have been announced since our last update, including two follow-ups to our current “best for most” pick (the Retroid Pocket 6 and the more marginally updated Retroid Pocket G2) and a new version of our “best overall” pick (the AYN Odin 3). Other competitors like Ayaneo’s KONKR Pocket Fit are also on the way, and there’s been a wave of new dual-screen models like the AYN Thor, Ayaneo Pocket DS and Anbernic RG DS. We think our current recommendations will still satisfy most shoppers, but since we’re still working to test most of these newer devices, we wanted to give a heads-up for anyone who wants the absolute latest. In the meantime, we’ve added testing notes on a few other emulation-focused handhelds as well as a couple new portable PCs like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. Table of contents Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Other gaming handhelds we've tested What to know about the gaming handheld market Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Sam Rutherford for Engadget Read our full Nintendo Switch 2 review The new Nintendo Switch 2 is already more popular than any of the handhelds above, but we haven’t made it a formal pick in this guide since it exists in its own world. As one of the newest devices from the big three console manufacturers, most people aren’t choosing between it and the handheld PCs or emulation devices above. The main reason to buy a Switch 2 is to play new Nintendo games, and no other device can (legally) offer that. Likewise, the Switch 2 doesn’t even try to offer the flexibility of a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X or even the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, the hardware itself is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with dramatically improved performance, a sharper, faster and bigger 7.9-inch display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers and more storage. It’s a wholly more polished take on the Switch 1’s ideas. Does that make it a must-buy right now? Unless you’re worried about a tariff-induced price hike — which may not be the most outlandish fear — not really. Donkey Kong Bananza is a joy, Mario Kart World is fun enough and playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Nintendo console is kind of surreal, but the list of true must-plays that are exclusive to the Switch 2 is still limited. That’s OK — it’s only been a few months. But don’t feel like you must rush out and splash the cash today unless you have a serious case of Donkey Kong-induced FOMO. Other gaming handhelds we've tested The Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming handhelds we’ve tested, not a comprehensive list of everything we've ever tried. Lenovo Legion Go 2 The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is a capable alternative to the ROG Xbox Ally X with a mondo-sized 8.8-inch display. That screen is the main reason to consider it, as it’s a vivid OLED panel that supports VRR and has a 144Hz native refresh rate. Like the Switch, it also comes with detachable controllers — one of which includes a useful touchpad for navigating Windows — plus a built-in kickstand for tabletop play. That said, it’s an absolute tank at just over two pounds, and we found it to perform a little worse than the Xbox Ally X at equal settings. It’s also even more expensive, starting at $1,100 and rising to $1,350 for a config with the same Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. It’s a lovely device if you’ve got cash to burn — and to be fair, none of these Windows handhelds are for anyone looking for “value” — but the Xbox Ally X is a better buy for most. The MSI Claw 8 AI+. Sam Rutherford for Engadget MSI Claw 8 AI+ The original MSI Claw was a flop, but the newer Claw 8 AI+ is much more appealing if you’re willing to pay for a larger and slightly more powerful alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X. With its Intel Core Ultra 7-258V chip and 32GB of RAM, it typically pumped out 10 to 15 percent higher frame rates than last-gen models like the ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go in our testing. (Another model is available with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip.) Battery life is relatively strong, while its 8-inch 120Hz IPS display is plenty bright and supports VRR. There are smooth Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a built-in fingerprint sensor beyond that. The Claw’s main issue is its price: At $1,100 after recent price hikes, it’s hard to justify over the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is already too expensive for most people. ASUS' handheld is lighter and easier to grip on top of that — though the Claw is thinner — and its overhauled Xbox UI, while far from perfect, is still easier to get around than MSI’s Center M hub. There's a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900 as well, but we haven’t tested that one. The ModRetro Chromatic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget ModRetro Chromatic The ModRetro Chromatic is a competitor to the Analogue Pocket that can similarly play actual Game Boy cartridges via FPGA. With its premium metal frame, loud speaker, tight d-pad and beautifully bright 2.56-inch display, it’s an impressive modernization of Nintendo’s classic handheld. ModRetro also publishes a number of games specifically for the device, including a pretty great version of Tetris that comes bundled in the box. However, for many, its faithfulness to the original Game Boy probably goes too far: It requires three AA batteries for power, and unlike the Analogue Pocket it doesn’t support custom save states. It’s also designed for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games only; it can’t play any Game Boy Advance cartridges or games from other retro handhelds like Analogue’s device, nor does doesn’t support ROMs. For only $20 less than the Pocket, that makes it a tough sell, even if the hardware is arguably higher-quality. There’s also the lethal, autonomous elephant in the room: ModRetro is founded by Palmer Luckey, the idiosyncratic entrepreneur behind the Oculus Rift who has gone on to form Anduril Industries, a defense contractor that makes drones, surveillance systems and other AI-powered military tech. He has also espoused political views that many people — and this is the tamest way I can put this — may not be comfortable backing. We are not here to police where you can spend your money, and the Chromatic does much of what it wants to do well. Still, all of these handhelds are just so inessential, and no other option that we know of is as closely tied to an arms dealer. The Lenovo Legion Go S. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows, Z2 Go chip) The Windows 11 version of the Lenovo Legion Go S has the same relatively comfortable design and commendable 8-inch 120Hz display as the SteamOS model we highlight above. With the Z2 Go model we tested, though, its performance lags too far behind the ROG Ally X, Claw 8 AI+ and original Legion Go for something priced at $730. Windows is still clunky, too. The Ayaneo Flip DS. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Ayaneo Flip DS The Ayaneo Flip DS is a cool concept: a powerful Windows machine with a clamshell design and dual displays, sort of like a supercharged Nintendo DS. It feels sturdy, it performs roughly on par with the other Ryzen 7 7840U (or 8840U) handhelds in this guide, and its 7-inch top display is sharp, fast and bright. The second screen makes it a natural fit for emulating Wii U or 3DS games, but you could also, say, look up a guide or play a YouTube video without having to close whatever you’re playing. Unfortunately, this is more of a neat idea than a fully thought-out product. The folding design means that the joysticks have to be short and recessed, while the face buttons and d-pad are uncomfortably flat. The whole thing is overly thick and heavy, plus it runs very hot. Battery life tops out around two hours, and actually managing two displays on a Windows handheld is about as clunky as you'd expect. With prices now starting above $1,100, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator. We're always happy to see more weird hardware, though. The Ayaneo Kun. Photo by James Trew / Engadget Ayaneo Kun The Ayaneo Kun is one of the more decadent Windows handhelds we’ve tested. With a sharp 8.4-inch display, a Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of RAM, up to 4TB of storage, a sizable 75Whr battery and a 54W max TDP, it’s both a capable gaming device and a feasible replacement for a desktop PC. But it now starts at a pricey $999, it’s huge and it suffers from the usual Windows-related issues. It also lacks VRR, and that Ryzen chip is no longer the latest and greatest. The Kun is still a fine device in a vacuum, but the ROG Xbox Ally X is a better buy. This is technically an older model for Ayaneo, too, as the company seems to launch a new handheld every other hour these days. The Retroid Pocket Classic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Classic The Retroid Pocket Classic is another Game Boy-style vertical handheld in the vein of the Analogue Pocket, but like the other Retroid models we’ve highlighted, it’s an Android device designed to emulate games via ROM files, not genuine cartridges. (Naturally, it can also play native Android games.) It’s still far clunkier to set up and use as a result, and its overall design feels more toy-like than either the Pocket or ModRetro Chromatic. But its Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chip is easily powerful enough to play any classic handheld system (along with most other retro games that don’t require joystick controls), while its 3.9-inch OLED display is superbly bright, sharp and colorful. The battery can last more than 10 hours when emulating lower-power systems, and Retroid sells a version with six face buttons instead of the standard four if you want to play older Sega Genesis and Saturn games in particular. The Analogue Pocket is still more premium and rewarding to use, but if you want a similar form factor and can live with the typical quirks that come with a device like this, the Classic is a good value at $129. Of the many Game Boy-style handhelds out there that solely rely on software emulation, it’s the one we’d recommend first. The Retroid Pocket Mini (bottom) and Retroid Pocket 5. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Mini The Retroid Pocket Mini is essentially a smaller version of the Retroid Pocket 5. It runs on the same Snapdragon 865 chip and feels just as sturdy, but it has a smaller 3.92-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This makes it a more natural fit for older retro consoles, as you won’t get the black boxes you’d see on a 16:9 display like the one on the Pocket 5. If you mainly want to emulate systems like the SNES, Sega Genesis or Game Boy Color and don’t mind paying extra for a rich OLED display, it’s a good little device. But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. This device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however. Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4 The 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up. The Miyoo Mini Plus (left) and TrimUI Brick. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Miyoo Mini Plus The Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable, though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, it can also be difficult to actually buy. It's a nice choice if you want something more compact than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but that model's roomier design, more vibrant OLED panel and longer battery life makes it worth the extra cash for most people. TrimUI Brick The TrimUI Brick is another low-cost vertical handheld that’s surprisingly well-built for an $80-ish device, thanks to its brushed metal backplate and impressive 3.2-inch IPS display. It has a weaker chip than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but it can still emulate older handheld games just fine, and its tiny frame makes it much easier to actually fit in a pocket. That said, while it has a sharper and more vivid screen than the Miyoo Mini Plus (its closest rival), the face buttons, d-pad and especially back buttons are all stiffer, and its stock UI feels similarly bootleg. (Some of the icons for different systems in the game library: “GomeBuy,” “Fanicon,” and “PloyStotion.”) You can fix the latter with custom firmware, but Retroid’s interface is easier to grok by default, and its setup process is less annoying. Most people interested in this class of device will be happier paying up for the Pocket Classic instead. The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anbernic RG35XX Plus The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while its stronger chip is appreciated, it's still far behind the Retroid Pocket Classic. The Anbernic RG35XXSP. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Anbernic RG35XXSP The Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP. That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying. Anbernic RG405M The Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing. The PlayStation Portal. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget PlayStation Portal The PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. The 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud, which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller, so most people are better off saving their $200. Logitech G Cloud The Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to retail for $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price. What to know about the gaming handheld market Jeff Dunn / Engadget You can break down the gaming handheld market into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on Linux, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released PC games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you’d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. They’re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold, however, and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they’re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000. Further down on the price spectrum are \"mobile handhelds\" like the Logitech G Cloud or Retroid Pocket. These devices often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish (before tariffs). They aren’t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they’re usually more compact than a portable PC, and you can still use them for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many gamers actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like RetroArch. Getting emulators to work can be complicated, and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is legally murky. One lawsuit from Nintendo led to the shutdown of the most prominent Switch and 3DS emulators, for instance. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, though, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics — provided you don’t want to just use your phone. We’ll call the last tier “handhelds that do their own thing.” This is a catch-all for things like the Switch 2 or Playdate: portable devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique gaming experience. They aren’t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they’re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use. Recent updates November 2025: The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X replaces the older ROG Ally X as our new favorite Windows gaming handheld. We’ve also added testing notes on the Lenovo Legion Go 2, ModRetro Chromatic and a couple of emulation-based handhelds in the Retroid Pocket Classic and TrimUI Brick. We’re working to test several other recent releases for our next update, including updated versions of the Retroid Pocket 5 and AYN Odin 2. August 2025: We’ve added the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S as a new recommendation and updated our top Windows pick to reflect the upcoming release of ASUS’ and Microsoft’s ROG Xbox Ally devices, which will feature an overhauled Windows UI. We’ve also added a note on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. We’ll include testing notes on the Retroid Pocket Classic, TrimUI Brick and ModRetro Chromatic in the near future. (Note: Yours truly went on paternity leave after our last update — apologies for the delay!) May 2025: We’ve tested the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and recommended it as an alternative to the Retroid Pocket 5. We’re also watching out for the first third-party devices that run SteamOS, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S, and the next ASUS ROG Ally device, which seems to be arriving soon based on recent leaks. March 2025: We’ve edited this guide for clarity and added testing notes for the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows version). Our main picks are unchanged. Looking ahead, we’re keeping an eye on upcoming Windows handhelds from Acer and Ayaneo, a pair of new emulation devices from Retroid, the first third-party devices to ship with SteamOS and more machines that run on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 chips, among others. January 2025: We have a new top pick among emulation-focused handhelds: the Retroid Pocket 5. Beyond that, we’ve added notes on a few other devices we’ve tested, including the Retroid Pocket Mini and Anbernic RG35XXSP; lightly edited other blurbs to reflect changes in the market; and removed a couple write-ups for products that’ve been discontinued. We're also keeping an eye on new handhelds that’ve recently been announced or are strongly rumored to arrive in the near future, including devices from MSI and Lenovo. August 2024: We’ve replaced the ASUS ROG Ally, our prior pick for the best Windows gaming handheld, with the new and improved ROG Ally X. We’ve also checked to make sure all availability and pricing details noted throughout the guide are accurate. June 2024: We’ve updated this guide to ensure all of our recommendations are up to date, adding a note on ASUS’ upcoming ROG Ally X in the process. We’ve also included details on two new handhelds we’ve tested since our previous update: the MSI Claw and Ayaneo Flip DS. Staying on top of this market is a tall task, but we’re currently looking at recent noteworthy releases like the PSP-esque AYN Odin 2 Mini and the GBA-style Anbernic RG35XXSP as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/best-handheld-gaming-system-140018863.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Handheld gaming systems are having a moment. While people have been gaming on the go since the halcyon days of the Game Boy, recent years have brought an avalanche of devices that let you play all sorts of games anywhere you want. But new machines seem to arrive every week, and figuring out which ones are actually worth buying can be overwhelming. Depending on your tastes, the right handheld could be a $100 emulator or a $1,000 portable PC. To help you narrow things down, we’ve spent months researching the best handheld gaming consoles and testing several top contenders. Here are the ones we like the most right now.Editor’s note (11/7/25): A barrage of new mobile emulation handhelds have been announced since our last update, including two follow-ups to our current “best for most” pick (the Retroid Pocket 6 and the more marginally updated Retroid Pocket G2) and a new version of our “best overall” pick (the AYN Odin 3). Other competitors like Ayaneo’s KONKR Pocket Fit are also on the way, and there’s been a wave of new dual-screen models like the AYN Thor, Ayaneo Pocket DS and Anbernic RG DS. We think our current recommendations will still satisfy most shoppers, but since we’re still working to test most of these newer devices, we wanted to give a heads-up for anyone who wants the absolute latest. In the meantime, we’ve added testing notes on a few other emulation-focused handhelds as well as a couple new portable PCs like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. Table of contents Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Other gaming handhelds we've tested What to know about the gaming handheld market Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Sam Rutherford for Engadget Read our full Nintendo Switch 2 review The new Nintendo Switch 2 is already more popular than any of the handhelds above, but we haven’t made it a formal pick in this guide since it exists in its own world. As one of the newest devices from the big three console manufacturers, most people aren’t choosing between it and the handheld PCs or emulation devices above. The main reason to buy a Switch 2 is to play new Nintendo games, and no other device can (legally) offer that. Likewise, the Switch 2 doesn’t even try to offer the flexibility of a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X or even the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, the hardware itself is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with dramatically improved performance, a sharper, faster and bigger 7.9-inch display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers and more storage. It’s a wholly more polished take on the Switch 1’s ideas. Does that make it a must-buy right now? Unless you’re worried about a tariff-induced price hike — which may not be the most outlandish fear — not really. Donkey Kong Bananza is a joy, Mario Kart World is fun enough and playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Nintendo console is kind of surreal, but the list of true must-plays that are exclusive to the Switch 2 is still limited. That’s OK — it’s only been a few months. But don’t feel like you must rush out and splash the cash today unless you have a serious case of Donkey Kong-induced FOMO. Other gaming handhelds we've tested The Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming handhelds we’ve tested, not a comprehensive list of everything we've ever tried. Lenovo Legion Go 2 The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is a capable alternative to the ROG Xbox Ally X with a mondo-sized 8.8-inch display. That screen is the main reason to consider it, as it’s a vivid OLED panel that supports VRR and has a 144Hz native refresh rate. Like the Switch, it also comes with detachable controllers — one of which includes a useful touchpad for navigating Windows — plus a built-in kickstand for tabletop play. That said, it’s an absolute tank at just over two pounds, and we found it to perform a little worse than the Xbox Ally X at equal settings. It’s also even more expensive, starting at $1,100 and rising to $1,350 for a config with the same Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. It’s a lovely device if you’ve got cash to burn — and to be fair, none of these Windows handhelds are for anyone looking for “value” — but the Xbox Ally X is a better buy for most. The MSI Claw 8 AI+. Sam Rutherford for Engadget MSI Claw 8 AI+ The original MSI Claw was a flop, but the newer Claw 8 AI+ is much more appealing if you’re willing to pay for a larger and slightly more powerful alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X. With its Intel Core Ultra 7-258V chip and 32GB of RAM, it typically pumped out 10 to 15 percent higher frame rates than last-gen models like the ROG Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go in our testing. (Another model is available with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip.) Battery life is relatively strong, while its 8-inch 120Hz IPS display is plenty bright and supports VRR. There are smooth Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a built-in fingerprint sensor beyond that. The Claw’s main issue is its price: At $1,100 after recent price hikes, it’s hard to justify over the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is already too expensive for most people. ASUS' handheld is lighter and easier to grip on top of that — though the Claw is thinner — and its overhauled Xbox UI, while far from perfect, is still easier to get around than MSI’s Center M hub. There's a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900 as well, but we haven’t tested that one. The ModRetro Chromatic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget ModRetro Chromatic The ModRetro Chromatic is a competitor to the Analogue Pocket that can similarly play actual Game Boy cartridges via FPGA. With its premium metal frame, loud speaker, tight d-pad and beautifully bright 2.56-inch display, it’s an impressive modernization of Nintendo’s classic handheld. ModRetro also publishes a number of games specifically for the device, including a pretty great version of Tetris that comes bundled in the box. However, for many, its faithfulness to the original Game Boy probably goes too far: It requires three AA batteries for power, and unlike the Analogue Pocket it doesn’t support custom save states. It’s also designed for Game Boy and Game Boy Color games only; it can’t play any Game Boy Advance cartridges or games from other retro handhelds like Analogue’s device, nor does doesn’t support ROMs. For only $20 less than the Pocket, that makes it a tough sell, even if the hardware is arguably higher-quality. There’s also the lethal, autonomous elephant in the room: ModRetro is founded by Palmer Luckey, the idiosyncratic entrepreneur behind the Oculus Rift who has gone on to form Anduril Industries, a defense contractor that makes drones, surveillance systems and other AI-powered military tech. He has also espoused political views that many people — and this is the tamest way I can put this — may not be comfortable backing. We are not here to police where you can spend your money, and the Chromatic does much of what it wants to do well. Still, all of these handhelds are just so inessential, and no other option that we know of is as closely tied to an arms dealer. The Lenovo Legion Go S. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows, Z2 Go chip) The Windows 11 version of the Lenovo Legion Go S has the same relatively comfortable design and commendable 8-inch 120Hz display as the SteamOS model we highlight above. With the Z2 Go model we tested, though, its performance lags too far behind the ROG Ally X, Claw 8 AI+ and original Legion Go for something priced at $730. Windows is still clunky, too. The Ayaneo Flip DS. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Ayaneo Flip DS The Ayaneo Flip DS is a cool concept: a powerful Windows machine with a clamshell design and dual displays, sort of like a supercharged Nintendo DS. It feels sturdy, it performs roughly on par with the other Ryzen 7 7840U (or 8840U) handhelds in this guide, and its 7-inch top display is sharp, fast and bright. The second screen makes it a natural fit for emulating Wii U or 3DS games, but you could also, say, look up a guide or play a YouTube video without having to close whatever you’re playing. Unfortunately, this is more of a neat idea than a fully thought-out product. The folding design means that the joysticks have to be short and recessed, while the face buttons and d-pad are uncomfortably flat. The whole thing is overly thick and heavy, plus it runs very hot. Battery life tops out around two hours, and actually managing two displays on a Windows handheld is about as clunky as you'd expect. With prices now starting above $1,100, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator. We're always happy to see more weird hardware, though. The Ayaneo Kun. Photo by James Trew / Engadget Ayaneo Kun The Ayaneo Kun is one of the more decadent Windows handhelds we’ve tested. With a sharp 8.4-inch display, a Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of RAM, up to 4TB of storage, a sizable 75Whr battery and a 54W max TDP, it’s both a capable gaming device and a feasible replacement for a desktop PC. But it now starts at a pricey $999, it’s huge and it suffers from the usual Windows-related issues. It also lacks VRR, and that Ryzen chip is no longer the latest and greatest. The Kun is still a fine device in a vacuum, but the ROG Xbox Ally X is a better buy. This is technically an older model for Ayaneo, too, as the company seems to launch a new handheld every other hour these days. The Retroid Pocket Classic. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Classic The Retroid Pocket Classic is another Game Boy-style vertical handheld in the vein of the Analogue Pocket, but like the other Retroid models we’ve highlighted, it’s an Android device designed to emulate games via ROM files, not genuine cartridges. (Naturally, it can also play native Android games.) It’s still far clunkier to set up and use as a result, and its overall design feels more toy-like than either the Pocket or ModRetro Chromatic. But its Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chip is easily powerful enough to play any classic handheld system (along with most other retro games that don’t require joystick controls), while its 3.9-inch OLED display is superbly bright, sharp and colorful. The battery can last more than 10 hours when emulating lower-power systems, and Retroid sells a version with six face buttons instead of the standard four if you want to play older Sega Genesis and Saturn games in particular. The Analogue Pocket is still more premium and rewarding to use, but if you want a similar form factor and can live with the typical quirks that come with a device like this, the Classic is a good value at $129. Of the many Game Boy-style handhelds out there that solely rely on software emulation, it’s the one we’d recommend first. The Retroid Pocket Mini (bottom) and Retroid Pocket 5. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Mini The Retroid Pocket Mini is essentially a smaller version of the Retroid Pocket 5. It runs on the same Snapdragon 865 chip and feels just as sturdy, but it has a smaller 3.92-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This makes it a more natural fit for older retro consoles, as you won’t get the black boxes you’d see on a 16:9 display like the one on the Pocket 5. If you mainly want to emulate systems like the SNES, Sega Genesis or Game Boy Color and don’t mind paying extra for a rich OLED display, it’s a good little device. But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. This device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however. Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4 The 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up. The Miyoo Mini Plus (left) and TrimUI Brick. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Miyoo Mini Plus The Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable, though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, it can also be difficult to actually buy. It's a nice choice if you want something more compact than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but that model's roomier design, more vibrant OLED panel and longer battery life makes it worth the extra cash for most people. TrimUI Brick The TrimUI Brick is another low-cost vertical handheld that’s surprisingly well-built for an $80-ish device, thanks to its brushed metal backplate and impressive 3.2-inch IPS display. It has a weaker chip than the Retroid Pocket Classic, but it can still emulate older handheld games just fine, and its tiny frame makes it much easier to actually fit in a pocket. That said, while it has a sharper and more vivid screen than the Miyoo Mini Plus (its closest rival), the face buttons, d-pad and especially back buttons are all stiffer, and its stock UI feels similarly bootleg. (Some of the icons for different systems in the game library: “GomeBuy,” “Fanicon,” and “PloyStotion.”) You can fix the latter with custom firmware, but Retroid’s interface is easier to grok by default, and its setup process is less annoying. Most people interested in this class of device will be happier paying up for the Pocket Classic instead. The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Anbernic RG35XX Plus The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while its stronger chip is appreciated, it's still far behind the Retroid Pocket Classic. The Anbernic RG35XXSP. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Anbernic RG35XXSP The Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP. That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying. Anbernic RG405M The Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing. The PlayStation Portal. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget PlayStation Portal The PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. The 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud, which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller, so most people are better off saving their $200. Logitech G Cloud The Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to retail for $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price.

          "standfirst": "Across industries, rising compute expenses are often cited as a barrier to AI adoption — but leading companies are finding that cost is no longer the real constraint. The tougher challenges (and the ones top of mind for many tech leaders)? Latency, flexibility and capacity. At Wonder, for instance, AI adds a mere few cents per order; the food delivery and takeout company is much more concerned with cloud capacity with skyrocketing demands. Recursion, for its part, has been focused on balancing small and larger-scale training and deployment via on-premises clusters and the cloud; this has afforded the biotech company flexibility for rapid experimentation. The companies’ true in-the-wild experiences highlight a broader industry trend: For enterprises operating AI at scale, economics aren&#x27;t the key decisive factor — the conversation has shifted from how to pay for AI to how fast it can be deployed and sustained. AI leaders from the two companies recently sat down with Venturebeat’s CEO and editor-in-chief Matt Marshall as part of VB’s traveling AI Impact Series. Here’s what they shared. Wonder: Rethink what you assume about capacityWonder uses AI to power everything from recommendations to logistics — yet, as of now, reported CTO James Chen, AI adds just a few cents per order. Chen explained that the technology component of a meal order costs 14 cents, the AI adds 2 to 3 cents, although that’s “going up really rapidly” to 5 to 8 cents. Still, that seems almost immaterial compared to total operating costs. Instead, the 100% cloud-native AI company’s main concern has been capacity with growing demand. Wonder was built with “the assumption” (which proved to be incorrect) that there would be “unlimited capacity” so they could move “super fast” and wouldn’t have to worry about managing infrastructure, Chen noted. But the company has grown quite a bit over the last few years, he said; as a result, about six months ago, “we started getting little signals from the cloud providers, ‘Hey, you might need to consider going to region two,’” because they were running out of capacity for CPU or data storage at their facilities as demand grew. It was “very shocking” that they had to move to plan B earlier than they anticipated. “Obviously it&#x27;s good practice to be multi-region, but we were thinking maybe two more years down the road,” said Chen. What&#x27;s not economically feasible (yet)Wonder built its own model to maximize its conversion rate, Chen noted; the goal is to surface new restaurants to relevant customers as much as possible. These are “isolated scenarios” where models are trained over time to be “very, very efficient and very fast.” Currently, the best bet for Wonder’s use case is large models, Chen noted. But in the long term, they’d like to move to small models that are hyper-customized to individuals (via AI agents or concierges) based on their purchase history and even their clickstream. “Having these micro models is definitely the best, but right now the cost is very expensive,” Chen noted. “If you try to create one for each person, it&#x27;s just not economically feasible.”Budgeting is an art, not a scienceWonder gives its devs and data scientists as much playroom as possible to experiment, and internal teams review the costs of use to make sure nobody turned on a model and “jacked up massive compute around a huge bill,” said Chen. The company is trying different things to offload to AI and operate within margins. “But then it&#x27;s very hard to budget because you have no idea,” he said. One of the challenging things is the pace of development; when a new model comes out, “we can’t just sit there, right? We have to use it.” Budgeting for the unknown economics of a token-based system is “definitely art versus science.” A critical component in the software development lifecycle is preserving context when using large native models, he explained. When you find something that works, you can add it to your company’s “corpus of context” that can be sent with every request. That’s big and it costs money each time. “Over 50%, up to 80% of your costs is just resending the same information back into the same engine again on every request,” said Chen. In theory, the more they do should require less cost per unit. “I know when a transaction happens, I&#x27;ll pay the X cent tax for each one, but I don&#x27;t want to be limited to use the technology for all these other creative ideas.\"The &#x27;vindication moment&#x27; for RecursionRecursion, for its part, has focused on meeting broad-ranging compute needs via a hybrid infrastructure of on-premise clusters and cloud inference. When initially looking to build out its AI infrastructure, the company had to go with its own setup, as “the cloud providers didn&#x27;t have very many good offerings,” explained CTO Ben Mabey. “The vindication moment was that we needed more compute and we looked to the cloud providers and they were like, ‘Maybe in a year or so.’” The company’s first cluster in 2017 incorporated Nvidia gaming GPUs (1080s, launched in 2016); they have since added Nvidia H100s and A100s, and use a Kubernetes cluster that they run in the cloud or on-prem. Addressing the longevity question, Mabey noted: “These gaming GPUs are actually still being used today, which is crazy, right? The myth that a GPU&#x27;s life span is only three years, that&#x27;s definitely not the case. A100s are still top of the list, they&#x27;re the workhorse of the industry.” Best use cases on-prem vs cloud; cost differencesMore recently, Mabey’s team has been training a foundation model on Recursion’s image repository (which consists of petabytes of data and more than 200 pictures). This and other types of big training jobs have required a “massive cluster” and connected, multi-node setups. “When we need that fully-connected network and access to a lot of our data in a high parallel file system, we go on-prem,” he explained. On the other hand, shorter workloads run in the cloud. Recursion’s method is to “pre-empt” GPUs and Google tensor processing units (TPUs), which is the process of interrupting running GPU tasks to work on higher-priority ones. “Because we don&#x27;t care about the speed in some of these inference workloads where we&#x27;re uploading biological data, whether that&#x27;s an image or sequencing data, DNA data,” Mabey explained. “We can say, ‘Give this to us in an hour,’ and we&#x27;re fine if it kills the job.” From a cost perspective, moving large workloads on-prem is “conservatively” 10 times cheaper, Mabey noted; for a five year TCO, it&#x27;s half the cost. On the other hand, for smaller storage needs, the cloud can be “pretty competitive” cost-wise. Ultimately, Mabey urged tech leaders to step back and determine whether they’re truly willing to commit to AI; cost-effective solutions typically require multi-year buy-ins. “From a psychological perspective, I&#x27;ve seen peers of ours who will not invest in compute, and as a result they&#x27;re always paying on demand,\" said Mabey. \"Their teams use far less compute because they don&#x27;t want to run up the cloud bill. Innovation really gets hampered by people not wanting to burn money.”",
          "content": "Across industries, rising compute expenses are often cited as a barrier to AI adoption — but leading companies are finding that cost is no longer the real constraint. The tougher challenges (and the ones top of mind for many tech leaders)? Latency, flexibility and capacity. At Wonder, for instance, AI adds a mere few cents per order; the food delivery and takeout company is much more concerned with cloud capacity with skyrocketing demands. Recursion, for its part, has been focused on balancing small and larger-scale training and deployment via on-premises clusters and the cloud; this has afforded the biotech company flexibility for rapid experimentation. The companies’ true in-the-wild experiences highlight a broader industry trend: For enterprises operating AI at scale, economics aren&#x27;t the key decisive factor — the conversation has shifted from how to pay for AI to how fast it can be deployed and sustained. AI leaders from the two companies recently sat down with Venturebeat’s CEO and editor-in-chief Matt Marshall as part of VB’s traveling AI Impact Series. Here’s what they shared. Wonder: Rethink what you assume about capacityWonder uses AI to power everything from recommendations to logistics — yet, as of now, reported CTO James Chen, AI adds just a few cents per order. Chen explained that the technology component of a meal order costs 14 cents, the AI adds 2 to 3 cents, although that’s “going up really rapidly” to 5 to 8 cents. Still, that seems almost immaterial compared to total operating costs. Instead, the 100% cloud-native AI company’s main concern has been capacity with growing demand. Wonder was built with “the assumption” (which proved to be incorrect) that there would be “unlimited capacity” so they could move “super fast” and wouldn’t have to worry about managing infrastructure, Chen noted. But the company has grown quite a bit over the last few years, he said; as a result, about six months ago, “we started getting little signals from the cloud providers, ‘Hey, you might need to consider going to region two,’” because they were running out of capacity for CPU or data storage at their facilities as demand grew. It was “very shocking” that they had to move to plan B earlier than they anticipated. “Obviously it&#x27;s good practice to be multi-region, but we were thinking maybe two more years down the road,” said Chen. What&#x27;s not economically feasible (yet)Wonder built its own model to maximize its conversion rate, Chen noted; the goal is to surface new restaurants to relevant customers as much as possible. These are “isolated scenarios” where models are trained over time to be “very, very efficient and very fast.” Currently, the best bet for Wonder’s use case is large models, Chen noted. But in the long term, they’d like to move to small models that are hyper-customized to individuals (via AI agents or concierges) based on their purchase history and even their clickstream. “Having these micro models is definitely the best, but right now the cost is very expensive,” Chen noted. “If you try to create one for each person, it&#x27;s just not economically feasible.”Budgeting is an art, not a scienceWonder gives its devs and data scientists as much playroom as possible to experiment, and internal teams review the costs of use to make sure nobody turned on a model and “jacked up massive compute around a huge bill,” said Chen. The company is trying different things to offload to AI and operate within margins. “But then it&#x27;s very hard to budget because you have no idea,” he said. One of the challenging things is the pace of development; when a new model comes out, “we can’t just sit there, right? We have to use it.” Budgeting for the unknown economics of a token-based system is “definitely art versus science.” A critical component in the software development lifecycle is preserving context when using large native models, he explained.

          "standfirst": "Researchers at New York University have developed a new architecture for diffusion models that improves the semantic representation of the images they generate. “Diffusion Transformer with Representation Autoencoders” (RAE) challenges some of the accepted norms of building diffusion models. The NYU researcher&#x27;s model is more efficient and accurate than standard diffusion models, takes advantage of the latest research in representation learning and could pave the way for new applications that were previously too difficult or expensive.This breakthrough could unlock more reliable and powerful features for enterprise applications. \"To edit images well, a model has to really understand what’s in them,\" paper co-author Saining Xie told VentureBeat. \"RAE helps connect that understanding part with the generation part.\" He also pointed to future applications in \"RAG-based generation, where you use RAE encoder features for search and then generate new images based on the search results,\" as well as in \"video generation and action-conditioned world models.\"The state of generative modelingDiffusion models, the technology behind most of today’s powerful image generators, frame generation as a process of learning to compress and decompress images. A variational autoencoder (VAE) learns a compact representation of an image’s key features in a so-called “latent space.” The model is then trained to generate new images by reversing this process from random noise.While the diffusion part of these models has advanced, the autoencoder used in most of them has remained largely unchanged in recent years. According to the NYU researchers, this standard autoencoder (SD-VAE) is suitable for capturing low-level features and local appearance, but lacks the “global semantic structure crucial for generalization and generative performance.”At the same time, the field has seen impressive advances in image representation learning with models such as DINO, MAE and CLIP. These models learn semantically-structured visual features that generalize across tasks and can serve as a natural basis for visual understanding. However, a widely-held belief has kept devs from using these architectures in image generation: Models focused on semantics are not suitable for generating images because they don’t capture granular, pixel-level features. Practitioners also believe that diffusion models do not work well with the kind of high-dimensional representations that semantic models produce.Diffusion with representation encodersThe NYU researchers propose replacing the standard VAE with “representation autoencoders” (RAE). This new type of autoencoder pairs a pretrained representation encoder, like Meta’s DINO, with a trained vision transformer decoder. This approach simplifies the training process by using existing, powerful encoders that have already been trained on massive datasets.To make this work, the team developed a variant of the diffusion transformer (DiT), the backbone of most image generation models. This modified DiT can be trained efficiently in the high-dimensional space of RAEs without incurring huge compute costs. The researchers show that frozen representation encoders, even those optimized for semantics, can be adapted for image generation tasks. Their method yields reconstructions that are superior to the standard SD-VAE without adding architectural complexity. However, adopting this approach requires a shift in thinking. \"RAE isn’t a simple plug-and-play autoencoder; the diffusion modeling part also needs to evolve,\" Xie explained. \"One key point we want to highlight is that latent space modeling and generative modeling should be co-designed rather than treated separately.\"With the right architectural adjustments, the researchers found that higher-dimensional representations are an advantage, offering richer structure, faster convergence and better generation quality. In their paper, the researchers note that these \"higher-dimensional latents introduce effectively no extra compute or memory costs.\" Furthermore, the standard SD-VAE is more computationally expensive, requiring about six times more compute for the encoder and three times more for the decoder, compared to RAE.Stronger performance and efficiencyThe new model architecture delivers significant gains in both training efficiency and generation quality. The team&#x27;s improved diffusion recipe achieves strong results after only 80 training epochs. Compared to prior diffusion models trained on VAEs, the RAE-based model achieves a 47x training speedup. It also outperforms recent methods based on representation alignment with a 16x training speedup. This level of efficiency translates directly into lower training costs and faster model development cycles.For enterprise use, this translates into more reliable and consistent outputs. Xie noted that RAE-based models are less prone to semantic errors seen in classic diffusion, adding that RAE gives the model \"a much smarter lens on the data.\" He observed that leading models like ChatGPT-4o and Google&#x27;s Nano Banana are moving toward \"subject-driven, highly consistent and knowledge-augmented generation,\" and that RAE&#x27;s semantically rich foundation is key to achieving this reliability at scale and in open source models.The researchers demonstrated this performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric, where a lower score indicates higher-quality images, the RAE-based model achieved a state-of-the-art score of 1.51 without guidance. With AutoGuidance, a technique that uses a smaller model to steer the generation process, the FID score dropped to an even more impressive 1.13 for both 256x256 and 512x512 images.By successfully integrating modern representation learning into the diffusion framework, this work opens a new path for building more capable and cost-effective generative models. This unification points toward a future of more integrated AI systems. \"We believe that in the future, there will be a single, unified representation model that captures the rich, underlying structure of reality... capable of decoding into many different output modalities,\" Xie said. He added that RAE offers a unique path toward this goal: \"The high-dimensional latent space should be learned separately to provide a strong prior that can then be decoded into various modalities — rather than relying on a brute-force approach of mixing all data and training with multiple objectives at once.\"",

          "title": "Moonshot's Kimi K2 Thinking emerges as leading open source AI, outperforming GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5 on key benchmarks",
          "standfirst": "Even as concern and skepticism grows over U.S. AI startup OpenAI&#x27;s buildout strategy and high spending commitments, Chinese open source AI providers are escalating their competition and one has even caught up to OpenAI&#x27;s flagship, paid proprietary model GPT-5 in key third-party performance benchmarks with a new, free model. The Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI’s new Kimi K2 Thinking model, released today, has vaulted past both proprietary and open-weight competitors to claim the top position in reasoning, coding, and agentic-tool benchmarks. Despite being fully open-source, the model now outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-5, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking mode), and xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 on several standard evaluations — an inflection point for the competitiveness of open AI systems.Developers can access the model via platform.moonshot.ai and kimi.com; weights and code are hosted on Hugging Face. The open release includes APIs for chat, reasoning, and multi-tool workflows.Users can try out Kimi K2 Thinking directly through its own ChatGPT-like website competitor and on a Hugging Face space as well. Modified Standard Open Source LicenseMoonshot AI has formally released Kimi K2 Thinking under a Modified MIT License on Hugging Face.The license grants full commercial and derivative rights — meaning individual researchers and developers working on behalf of enterprise clients can access it freely and use it in commercial applications — but adds one restriction:\"If the software or any derivative product serves over 100 million monthly active users or generates over $20 million USD per month in revenue, the deployer must prominently display &#x27;Kimi K2&#x27; on the product’s user interface.\"For most research and enterprise applications, this clause functions as a light-touch attribution requirement while preserving the freedoms of standard MIT licensing. It makes K2 Thinking one of the most permissively licensed frontier-class models currently available.A New Benchmark LeaderKimi K2 Thinking is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model built around one trillion parameters, of which 32 billion activate per inference. It combines long-horizon reasoning with structured tool use, executing up to 200–300 sequential tool calls without human intervention.According to Moonshot’s published test results, K2 Thinking achieved:44.9 % on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a state-of-the-art score;60.2 % on BrowseComp, an agentic web-search and reasoning test;71.3 % on SWE-Bench Verified and 83.1 % on LiveCodeBench v6, key coding evaluations;56.3 % on Seal-0, a benchmark for real-world information retrieval.Across these tasks, K2 Thinking consistently outperforms GPT-5’s corresponding scores and surpasses the previous open-weight leader MiniMax-M2—released just weeks earlier by Chinese rival MiniMax AI.Open Model Outperforms Proprietary SystemsGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking remain the leading proprietary “thinking” models. Yet in the same benchmark suite, K2 Thinking’s agentic reasoning scores exceed both: for instance, on BrowseComp the open model’s 60.2 % decisively leads GPT-5’s 54.9 % and Claude 4.5’s 24.1 %.K2 Thinking also edges GPT-5 in GPQA Diamond (85.7 % vs 84.5 %) and matches it on mathematical reasoning tasks such as AIME 2025 and HMMT 2025. Only in certain heavy-mode configurations—where GPT-5 aggregates multiple trajectories—does the proprietary model regain parity.That Moonshot’s fully open-weight release can meet or exceed GPT-5’s scores marks a turning point. The gap between closed frontier systems and publicly available models has effectively collapsed for high-end reasoning and coding.Surpassing MiniMax-M2: The Previous Open-Source BenchmarkWhen VentureBeat profiled MiniMax-M2 just a week and a half ago, it was hailed as the “new king of open-source LLMs,” achieving top scores among open-weight systems:τ²-Bench 77.2BrowseComp 44.0FinSearchComp-global 65.5SWE-Bench Verified 69.4Those results placed MiniMax-M2 near GPT-5-level capability in agentic tool use. Yet Kimi K2 Thinking now eclipses them by wide margins.Its BrowseComp result of 60.2 % exceeds M2’s 44.0 %, and its SWE-Bench Verified 71.3 % edges out M2’s 69.4 %. Even on financial-reasoning tasks such as FinSearchComp-T3 (47.4 %), K2 Thinking performs comparably while maintaining superior general-purpose reasoning.Technically, both models adopt sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures for compute efficiency, but Moonshot’s network activates more experts and deploys advanced quantization-aware training (INT4 QAT). This design doubles inference speed relative to standard precision without degrading accuracy—critical for long “thinking-token” sessions reaching 256 k context windows.Agentic Reasoning and Tool UseK2 Thinking’s defining capability lies in its explicit reasoning trace. The model outputs an auxiliary field, reasoning_content, revealing intermediate logic before each final response. This transparency preserves coherence across long multi-turn tasks and multi-step tool calls.A reference implementation published by Moonshot demonstrates how the model autonomously conducts a “daily news report” workflow: invoking date and web-search tools, analyzing retrieved content, and composing structured output—all while maintaining internal reasoning state.This end-to-end autonomy enables the model to plan, search, execute, and synthesize evidence across hundreds of steps, mirroring the emerging class of “agentic AI” systems that operate with minimal supervision.Efficiency and AccessDespite its trillion-parameter scale, K2 Thinking’s runtime cost remains modest. Moonshot lists usage at:$0.15 / 1 M tokens (cache hit)$0.60 / 1 M tokens (cache miss)$2.50 / 1 M tokens outputThese rates are competitive even against MiniMax-M2’s $0.30 input / $1.20 output pricing—and an order of magnitude below GPT-5 ($1.25 input / $10 output).Comparative Context: Open-Weight AccelerationThe rapid succession of M2 and K2 Thinking illustrates how quickly open-source research is catching frontier systems. MiniMax-M2 demonstrated that open models could approach GPT-5-class agentic capability at a fraction of the compute cost. Moonshot has now advanced that frontier further, pushing open weights beyond parity into outright leadership.Both models rely on sparse activation for efficiency, but K2 Thinking’s higher activation count (32 B vs 10 B active parameters) yields stronger reasoning fidelity across domains. Its test-time scaling—expanding “thinking tokens” and tool-calling turns—provides measurable performance gains without retraining, a feature not yet observed in MiniMax-M2.Technical OutlookMoonshot reports that K2 Thinking supports native INT4 inference and 256 k-token contexts with minimal performance degradation. Its architecture integrates quantization, parallel trajectory aggregation (“heavy mode”), and Mixture-of-Experts routing tuned for reasoning tasks.In practice, these optimizations allow K2 Thinking to sustain complex planning loops—code compile–test–fix, search–analyze–summarize—over hundreds of tool calls. This capability underpins its superior results on BrowseComp and SWE-Bench, where reasoning continuity is decisive.Enormous Implications for the AI EcosystemThe convergence of open and closed models at the high end signals a structural shift in the AI landscape. Enterprises that once relied exclusively on proprietary APIs can now deploy open alternatives matching GPT-5-level reasoning while retaining full control of weights, data, and compliance.Moonshot’s open publication strategy follows the precedent set by DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, GLM-4.6 and MiniMax-M2 but extends it to full agentic reasoning. For academic and enterprise developers, K2 Thinking provides both transparency and interoperability—the ability to inspect reasoning traces and fine-tune performance for domain-specific agents.The arrival of K2 Thinking signals that Moonshot — a young startup founded in 2023 with investment from some of China&#x27;s biggest apps and tech companies — is here to play in an intensifying competition, and comes amid growing scrutiny of the financial sustainability of AI’s largest players. Just a day ago, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked controversy after suggesting at WSJ Tech Live event that the U.S. government might eventually need to provide a “backstop” for the company’s more than $1.4 trillion in compute and data-center commitments — a comment widely interpreted as a call for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees.Although Friar later clarified that OpenAI was not seeking direct federal support, the episode reignited debate about the scale and concentration of AI capital spending. With OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google all racing to secure long-term chip supply, critics warn of an unsustainable investment bubble and “AI arms race” driven more by strategic fear than commercial returns — one that could \"blow up\" and take down the entire global economy with it if there is hesitation or market uncertainty, as so many trades and valuations have now been made in anticipation of continued hefty AI investment and massive returns. Against that backdrop, Moonshot AI’s and MiniMax’s open-weight releases put more pressure on U.S. proprietary AI firms and their backers to justify the size of the investments and paths to profitability. If an enterprise customer can just as easily get comparable or better performance from a free, open source Chinese AI model than they do with paid, proprietary AI solutions like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Sonnet 4.5, or Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro — why would they continue paying to access the proprietary models? Already, Silicon Valley stalwarts like Airbnb have raised eyebrows for admitting to heavily using Chinese open source alternatives like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen over OpenAI&#x27;s proprietary offerings. For investors and enterprises, these developments suggest that high-end AI capability is no longer synonymous with high-end capital expenditure. The most advanced reasoning systems may now come not from companies building gigascale data centers, but from research groups optimizing architectures and quantization for efficiency.In that sense, K2 Thinking’s benchmark dominance is not just a technical milestone—it’s a strategic one, arriving at a moment when the AI market’s biggest question has shifted from how powerful models can become to who can afford to sustain them.What It Means for Enterprises Going ForwardWithin weeks of MiniMax-M2’s ascent, Kimi K2 Thinking has overtaken it—along with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5—across nearly every reasoning and agentic benchmark. The model demonstrates that open-weight systems can now meet or surpass proprietary frontier models in both capability and efficiency.For the AI research community, K2 Thinking represents more than another open model: it is evidence that the frontier has become collaborative. The best-performing reasoning model available today is not a closed commercial product but an open-source system accessible to anyone.",
          "content": "Even as concern and skepticism grows over U.S. AI startup OpenAI&#x27;s buildout strategy and high spending commitments, Chinese open source AI providers are escalating their competition and one has even caught up to OpenAI&#x27;s flagship, paid proprietary model GPT-5 in key third-party performance benchmarks with a new, free model. The Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI’s new Kimi K2 Thinking model, released today, has vaulted past both proprietary and open-weight competitors to claim the top position in reasoning, coding, and agentic-tool benchmarks. Despite being fully open-source, the model now outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-5, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking mode), and xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 on several standard evaluations — an inflection point for the competitiveness of open AI systems.Developers can access the model via platform.moonshot.ai and kimi.com; weights and code are hosted on Hugging Face. The open release includes APIs for chat, reasoning, and multi-tool workflows.Users can try out Kimi K2 Thinking directly through its own ChatGPT-like website competitor and on a Hugging Face space as well. Modified Standard Open Source LicenseMoonshot AI has formally released Kimi K2 Thinking under a Modified MIT License on Hugging Face.The license grants full commercial and derivative rights — meaning individual researchers and developers working on behalf of enterprise clients can access it freely and use it in commercial applications — but adds one restriction:\"If the software or any derivative product serves over 100 million monthly active users or generates over $20 million USD per month in revenue, the deployer must prominently display &#x27;Kimi K2&#x27; on the product’s user interface.\"For most research and enterprise applications, this clause functions as a light-touch attribution requirement while preserving the freedoms of standard MIT licensing. It makes K2 Thinking one of the most permissively licensed frontier-class models currently available.A New Benchmark LeaderKimi K2 Thinking is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model built around one trillion parameters, of which 32 billion activate per inference. It combines long-horizon reasoning with structured tool use, executing up to 200–300 sequential tool calls without human intervention.According to Moonshot’s published test results, K2 Thinking achieved:44.9 % on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a state-of-the-art score;60.2 % on BrowseComp, an agentic web-search and reasoning test;71.3 % on SWE-Bench Verified and 83.1 % on LiveCodeBench v6, key coding evaluations;56.3 % on Seal-0, a benchmark for real-world information retrieval.Across these tasks, K2 Thinking consistently outperforms GPT-5’s corresponding scores and surpasses the previous open-weight leader MiniMax-M2—released just weeks earlier by Chinese rival MiniMax AI.Open Model Outperforms Proprietary SystemsGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking remain the leading proprietary “thinking” models. Yet in the same benchmark suite, K2 Thinking’s agentic reasoning scores exceed both: for instance, on BrowseComp the open model’s 60.2 % decisively leads GPT-5’s 54.9 % and Claude 4.5’s 24.1 %.K2 Thinking also edges GPT-5 in GPQA Diamond (85.7 % vs 84.5 %) and matches it on mathematical reasoning tasks such as AIME 2025 and HMMT 2025. Only in certain heavy-mode configurations—where GPT-5 aggregates multiple trajectories—does the proprietary model regain parity.That Moonshot’s fully open-weight release can meet or exceed GPT-5’s scores marks a turning point. The gap between closed frontier systems and publicly available models has effectively collapsed for high-end reasoning and coding.Surpassing MiniMax-M2: The Previous Open-Source BenchmarkWhen VentureBeat profiled MiniMax-M2 just a week and a half ago, it was hailed as the “new king of open-source LLMs,” achieving top scores among open-weight systems:τ²-Bench 77.2BrowseComp 44.0FinSearchComp-global 65.5SWE-Bench Verified 69.4Those results placed MiniMax-M2 near GPT-5-level capability in agentic tool use. Yet Kimi K2 Thinking now eclipses them by wide margins.Its BrowseComp result of 60.2 % exceeds M2’s 44.0 %, and its SWE-Bench Verified 71.3 % edges out M2’s 69.4 %. Even on financial-reasoning tasks such as FinSearchComp-T3 (47.4 %), K2 Thinking performs comparably while maintaining superior general-purpose reasoning.Technically, both models adopt sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures for compute efficiency, but Moonshot’s network activates more experts and deploys advanced quantization-aware training (INT4 QAT). This design doubles inference speed relative to standard precision without degrading accuracy—critical for long “thinking-token” sessions reaching 256 k context windows.Agentic Reasoning and Tool UseK2 Thinking’s defining capability lies in its explicit reasoning trace. The model outputs an auxiliary field, reasoning_content, revealing intermediate logic before each final response. This transparency preserves coherence across long multi-turn tasks and multi-step tool calls.A reference implementation published by Moonshot demonstrates how the model autonomously conducts a “daily news report” workflow: invoking date and web-search tools, analyzing retrieved content, and composing structured output—all while maintaining internal reasoning state.This end-to-end autonomy enables the model to plan, search, execute, and synthesize evidence across hundreds of steps, mirroring the emerging class of “agentic AI” systems that operate with minimal supervision.Efficiency and AccessDespite its trillion-parameter scale, K2 Thinking’s runtime cost remains modest. Moonshot lists usage at:$0.15 / 1 M tokens (cache hit)$0.60 / 1 M tokens (cache miss)$2.50 / 1 M tokens outputThese rates are competitive even against MiniMax-M2’s $0.30 input / $1.20 output pricing—and an order of magnitude below GPT-5 ($1.25 input / $10 output).Comparative Context: Open-Weight AccelerationThe rapid succession of M2 and K2 Thinking illustrates how quickly open-source research is catching frontier systems. MiniMax-M2 demonstrated that open models could approach GPT-5-class agentic capability at a fraction of the compute cost. Moonshot has now advanced that frontier further, pushing open weights beyond parity into outright leadership.Both models rely on sparse activation for efficiency, but K2 Thinking’s higher activation count (32 B vs 10 B active parameters) yields stronger reasoning fidelity across domains. Its test-time scaling—expanding “thinking tokens” and tool-calling turns—provides measurable performance gains without retraining, a feature not yet observed in MiniMax-M2.Technical OutlookMoonshot reports that K2 Thinking supports native INT4 inference and 256 k-token contexts with minimal performance degradation. Its architecture integrates quantization, parallel trajectory aggregation (“heavy mode”), and Mixture-of-Experts routing tuned for reasoning tasks.In practice, these optimizations allow K2 Thinking to sustain complex planning loops—code compile–test–fix, search–analyze–summarize—over hundreds of tool calls. This capability underpins its superior results on BrowseComp and SWE-Bench, where reasoning continuity is decisive.Enormous Implications for the AI EcosystemThe convergence of open and closed models at the high end signals a structural shift in the AI landscape. Enterprises that once relied exclusively on proprietary APIs can now deploy open alternatives matching GPT-5-level reasoning while retaining full control of weights, data, and compliance.Moonshot’s open publication strategy follows the precedent set by DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, GLM-4.6 and MiniMax-M2 but extends it to full agentic reasoning. For academic and enterprise developers, K2 Thinking provides both transparency and interoperability—the ability to inspect reasoning traces and fine-tune performance for domain-specific agents.The arrival of K2 Thinking signals that Moonshot — a young startup founded in 2023 with investment from some of China&#x27;s biggest apps and tech companies — is here to play in an intensifying competition, and comes amid growing scrutiny of the financial sustainability of AI’s largest players. Just a day ago, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked controversy after suggesting at WSJ Tech Live event that the U.S. government might eventually need to provide a “backstop” for the company’s more than $1.4 trillion in compute and data-center commitments — a comment widely interpreted as a call for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees.Although Friar later clarified that OpenAI was not seeking direct federal support, the episode reignited debate about the scale and concentration of AI capital spending. With OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google all racing to secure long-term chip supply, critics warn of an unsustainable investment bubble and “AI arms race” driven more by strategic fear than commercial returns — one that could \"blow up\" and take down the entire global economy with it if there is hesitation or market uncertainty, as so many trades and valuations have now been made in anticipation of continued hefty AI investment and massive returns. Against that backdrop, Moonshot AI’s and MiniMax’s open-weight releases put more pressure on U.S. proprietary AI firms and their backers to justify the size of the investments and paths to profitability. If an enterprise customer can just as easily get comparable or better performance from a free, open source Chinese AI model than they do with paid, proprietary AI solutions like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Sonnet 4.5, or Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro — why would they continue paying to access the proprietary models? Already, Silicon Valley stalwarts like Airbnb have raised eyebrows for admitting to heavily using Chinese open source alternatives like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen over OpenAI&#x27;s proprietary offerings. For investors and enterprises, these developments suggest that high-end AI capability is no longer synonymous with high-end capital expenditure.

          "standfirst": "Google Cloud is introducing what it calls its most powerful artificial intelligence infrastructure to date, unveiling a seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit and expanded Arm-based computing options designed to meet surging demand for AI model deployment — what the company characterizes as a fundamental industry shift from training models to serving them to billions of users.The announcement, made Thursday, centers on Ironwood, Google&#x27;s latest custom AI accelerator chip, which will become generally available in the coming weeks. In a striking validation of the technology, Anthropic, the AI safety company behind the Claude family of models, disclosed plans to access up to one million of these TPU chips — a commitment worth tens of billions of dollars and among the largest known AI infrastructure deals to date.The move underscores an intensifying competition among cloud providers to control the infrastructure layer powering artificial intelligence, even as questions mount about whether the industry can sustain its current pace of capital expenditure. Google&#x27;s approach — building custom silicon rather than relying solely on Nvidia&#x27;s dominant GPU chips — amounts to a long-term bet that vertical integration from chip design through software will deliver superior economics and performance.Why companies are racing to serve AI models, not just train themGoogle executives framed the announcements around what they call \"the age of inference\" — a transition point where companies shift resources from training frontier AI models to deploying them in production applications serving millions or billions of requests daily.\"Today&#x27;s frontier models, including Google&#x27;s Gemini, Veo, and Imagen and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude train and serve on Tensor Processing Units,\" said Amin Vahdat, vice president and general manager of AI and Infrastructure at Google Cloud. \"For many organizations, the focus is shifting from training these models to powering useful, responsive interactions with them.\"This transition has profound implications for infrastructure requirements. Where training workloads can often tolerate batch processing and longer completion times, inference — the process of actually running a trained model to generate responses — demands consistently low latency, high throughput, and unwavering reliability. A chatbot that takes 30 seconds to respond, or a coding assistant that frequently times out, becomes unusable regardless of the underlying model&#x27;s capabilities.Agentic workflows — where AI systems take autonomous actions rather than simply responding to prompts — create particularly complex infrastructure challenges, requiring tight coordination between specialized AI accelerators and general-purpose computing.Inside Ironwood&#x27;s architecture: 9,216 chips working as one supercomputerIronwood is more than incremental improvement over Google&#x27;s sixth-generation TPUs. According to technical specifications shared by the company, it delivers more than four times better performance for both training and inference workloads compared to its predecessor — gains that Google attributes to a system-level co-design approach rather than simply increasing transistor counts.The architecture&#x27;s most striking feature is its scale. A single Ironwood \"pod\" — a tightly integrated unit of TPU chips functioning as one supercomputer — can connect up to 9,216 individual chips through Google&#x27;s proprietary Inter-Chip Interconnect network operating at 9.6 terabits per second. To put that bandwidth in perspective, it&#x27;s roughly equivalent to downloading the entire Library of Congress in under two seconds.This massive interconnect fabric allows the 9,216 chips to share access to 1.77 petabytes of High Bandwidth Memory — memory fast enough to keep pace with the chips&#x27; processing speeds. That&#x27;s approximately 40,000 high-definition Blu-ray movies&#x27; worth of working memory, instantly accessible by thousands of processors simultaneously. \"For context, that means Ironwood Pods can deliver 118x more FP8 ExaFLOPS versus the next closest competitor,\" Google stated in technical documentation.The system employs Optical Circuit Switching technology that acts as a \"dynamic, reconfigurable fabric.\" When individual components fail or require maintenance — inevitable at this scale — the OCS technology automatically reroutes data traffic around the interruption within milliseconds, allowing workloads to continue running without user-visible disruption.This reliability focus reflects lessons learned from deploying five previous TPU generations. Google reported that its fleet-wide uptime for liquid-cooled systems has maintained approximately 99.999% availability since 2020 — equivalent to less than six minutes of downtime per year.Anthropic&#x27;s billion-dollar bet validates Google&#x27;s custom silicon strategyPerhaps the most significant external validation of Ironwood&#x27;s capabilities comes from Anthropic&#x27;s commitment to access up to one million TPU chips — a staggering figure in an industry where even clusters of 10,000 to 50,000 accelerators are considered massive.\"Anthropic and Google have a longstanding partnership and this latest expansion will help us continue to grow the compute we need to define the frontier of AI,\" said Krishna Rao, Anthropic&#x27;s chief financial officer, in the official partnership agreement. \"Our customers — from Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups — depend on Claude for their most important work, and this expanded capacity ensures we can meet our exponentially growing demand.\"According to a separate statement, Anthropic will have access to \"well over a gigawatt of capacity coming online in 2026\" — enough electricity to power a small city. The company specifically cited TPUs&#x27; \"price-performance and efficiency\" as key factors in the decision, along with \"existing experience in training and serving its models with TPUs.\"Industry analysts estimate that a commitment to access one million TPU chips, with associated infrastructure, networking, power, and cooling, likely represents a multi-year contract worth tens of billions of dollars — among the largest known cloud infrastructure commitments in history.James Bradbury, Anthropic&#x27;s head of compute, elaborated on the inference focus: \"Ironwood&#x27;s improvements in both inference performance and training scalability will help us scale efficiently while maintaining the speed and reliability our customers expect.\"Google&#x27;s Axion processors target the computing workloads that make AI possibleAlongside Ironwood, Google introduced expanded options for its Axion processor family — custom Arm-based CPUs designed for general-purpose workloads that support AI applications but don&#x27;t require specialized accelerators.The N4A instance type, now entering preview, targets what Google describes as \"microservices, containerized applications, open-source databases, batch, data analytics, development environments, experimentation, data preparation and web serving jobs that make AI applications possible.\" The company claims N4A delivers up to 2X better price-performance than comparable current-generation x86-based virtual machines.Google is also previewing C4A metal, its first bare-metal Arm instance, which provides dedicated physical servers for specialized workloads such as Android development, automotive systems, and software with strict licensing requirements.The Axion strategy reflects a growing conviction that the future of computing infrastructure requires both specialized AI accelerators and highly efficient general-purpose processors. While a TPU handles the computationally intensive task of running an AI model, Axion-class processors manage data ingestion, preprocessing, application logic, API serving, and countless other tasks in a modern AI application stack.Early customer results suggest the approach delivers measurable economic benefits. Vimeo reported observing \"a 30% improvement in performance for our core transcoding workload compared to comparable x86 VMs\" in initial N4A tests. ZoomInfo measured \"a 60% improvement in price-performance\" for data processing pipelines running on Java services, according to Sergei Koren, the company&#x27;s chief infrastructure architect.Software tools turn raw silicon performance into developer productivityHardware performance means little if developers cannot easily harness it. Google emphasized that Ironwood and Axion are integrated into what it calls AI Hypercomputer — \"an integrated supercomputing system that brings together compute, networking, storage, and software to improve system-level performance and efficiency.\"According to an October 2025 IDC Business Value Snapshot study, AI Hypercomputer customers achieved on average 353% three-year return on investment, 28% lower IT costs, and 55% more efficient IT teams.Google disclosed several software enhancements designed to maximize Ironwood utilization. Google Kubernetes Engine now offers advanced maintenance and topology awareness for TPU clusters, enabling intelligent scheduling and highly resilient deployments. The company&#x27;s open-source MaxText framework now supports advanced training techniques including Supervised Fine-Tuning and Generative Reinforcement Policy Optimization.Perhaps most significant for production deployments, Google&#x27;s Inference Gateway intelligently load-balances requests across model servers to optimize critical metrics. According to Google, it can reduce time-to-first-token latency by 96% and serving costs by up to 30% through techniques like prefix-cache-aware routing.The Inference Gateway monitors key metrics including KV cache hits, GPU or TPU utilization, and request queue length, then routes incoming requests to the optimal replica. For conversational AI applications where multiple requests might share context, routing requests with shared prefixes to the same server instance can dramatically reduce redundant computation.The hidden challenge: powering and cooling one-megawatt server racksBehind these announcements lies a massive physical infrastructure challenge that Google addressed at the recent Open Compute Project EMEA Summit. The company disclosed that it&#x27;s implementing +/-400 volt direct current power delivery capable of supporting up to one megawatt per rack — a tenfold increase from typical deployments.\"The AI era requires even greater power delivery capabilities,\" explained Madhusudan Iyengar and Amber Huffman, Google principal engineers, in an April 2025 blog post. \"ML will require more than 500 kW per IT rack before 2030.\"Google is collaborating with Meta and Microsoft to standardize electrical and mechanical interfaces for high-voltage DC distribution. The company selected 400 VDC specifically to leverage the supply chain established by electric vehicles, \"for greater economies of scale, more efficient manufacturing, and improved quality and scale.\"On cooling, Google revealed it will contribute its fifth-generation cooling distribution unit design to the Open Compute Project. The company has deployed liquid cooling \"at GigaWatt scale across more than 2,000 TPU Pods in the past seven years\" with fleet-wide availability of approximately 99.999%.Water can transport approximately 4,000 times more heat per unit volume than air for a given temperature change — critical as individual AI accelerator chips increasingly dissipate 1,000 watts or more.Custom silicon gambit challenges Nvidia&#x27;s AI accelerator dominanceGoogle&#x27;s announcements come as the AI infrastructure market reaches an inflection point. While Nvidia maintains overwhelming dominance in AI accelerators — holding an estimated 80-95% market share — cloud providers are increasingly investing in custom silicon to differentiate their offerings and improve unit economics.Amazon Web Services pioneered this approach with Graviton Arm-based CPUs and Inferentia / Trainium AI chips. Microsoft has developed Cobalt processors and is reportedly working on AI accelerators. Google now offers the most comprehensive custom silicon portfolio among major cloud providers.The strategy faces inherent challenges. Custom chip development requires enormous upfront investment — often billions of dollars. The software ecosystem for specialized accelerators lags behind Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA platform, which benefits from 15+ years of developer tools. And rapid AI model architecture evolution creates risk that custom silicon optimized for today&#x27;s models becomes less relevant as new techniques emerge.Yet Google argues its approach delivers unique advantages. \"This is how we built the first TPU ten years ago, which in turn unlocked the invention of the Transformer eight years ago — the very architecture that powers most of modern AI,\" the company noted, referring to the seminal \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper from Google researchers in 2017.The argument is that tight integration — \"model research, software, and hardware development under one roof\" — enables optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf components.Beyond Anthropic, several other customers provided early feedback. Lightricks, which develops creative AI tools, reported that early Ironwood testing \"makes us highly enthusiastic\" about creating \"more nuanced, precise, and higher-fidelity image and video generation for our millions of global customers,\" said Yoav HaCohen, the company&#x27;s research director.Google&#x27;s announcements raise questions that will play out over coming quarters. Can the industry sustain current infrastructure spending, with major AI companies collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars? Will custom silicon prove economically superior to Nvidia GPUs? How will model architectures evolve?For now, Google appears committed to a strategy that has defined the company for decades: building custom infrastructure to enable applications impossible on commodity hardware, then making that infrastructure available to customers who want similar capabilities without the capital investment.As the AI industry transitions from research labs to production deployments serving billions of users, that infrastructure layer — the silicon, software, networking, power, and cooling that make it all run — may prove as important as the models themselves.And if Anthropic&#x27;s willingness to commit to accessing up to one million chips is any indication, Google&#x27;s bet on custom silicon designed specifically for the age of inference may be paying off just as demand reaches its inflection point.",

The company has deployed liquid cooling \"at GigaWatt scale across more than 2,000 TPU Pods in the past seven years\" with fleet-wide availability of approximately 99.999%.Water can transport approximately 4,000 times more heat per unit volume than air for a given temperature change — critical as individual AI accelerator chips increasingly dissipate 1,000 watts or more.Custom silicon gambit challenges Nvidia&#x27;s AI accelerator dominanceGoogle&#x27;s announcements come as the AI infrastructure market reaches an inflection point. While Nvidia maintains overwhelming dominance in AI accelerators — holding an estimated 80-95% market share — cloud providers are increasingly investing in custom silicon to differentiate their offerings and improve unit economics.Amazon Web Services pioneered this approach with Graviton Arm-based CPUs and Inferentia / Trainium AI chips. Microsoft has developed Cobalt processors and is reportedly working on AI accelerators. Google now offers the most comprehensive custom silicon portfolio among major cloud providers.The strategy faces inherent challenges. Custom chip development requires enormous upfront investment — often billions of dollars. The software ecosystem for specialized accelerators lags behind Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA platform, which benefits from 15+ years of developer tools. And rapid AI model architecture evolution creates risk that custom silicon optimized for today&#x27;s models becomes less relevant as new techniques emerge.Yet Google argues its approach delivers unique advantages. \"This is how we built the first TPU ten years ago, which in turn unlocked the invention of the Transformer eight years ago — the very architecture that powers most of modern AI,\" the company noted, referring to the seminal \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper from Google researchers in 2017.The argument is that tight integration — \"model research, software, and hardware development under one roof\" — enables optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf components.Beyond Anthropic, several other customers provided early feedback. Lightricks, which develops creative AI tools, reported that early Ironwood testing \"makes us highly enthusiastic\" about creating \"more nuanced, precise, and higher-fidelity image and video generation for our millions of global customers,\" said Yoav HaCohen, the company&#x27;s research director.Google&#x27;s announcements raise questions that will play out over coming quarters. Can the industry sustain current infrastructure spending, with major AI companies collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars? Will custom silicon prove economically superior to Nvidia GPUs? How will model architectures evolve?For now, Google appears committed to a strategy that has defined the company for decades: building custom infrastructure to enable applications impossible on commodity hardware, then making that infrastructure available to customers who want similar capabilities without the capital investment.As the AI industry transitions from research labs to production deployments serving billions of users, that infrastructure layer — the silicon, software, networking, power, and cooling that make it all run — may prove as important as the models themselves.And if Anthropic&#x27;s willingness to commit to accessing up to one million chips is any indication, Google&#x27;s bet on custom silicon designed specifically for the age of inference may be paying off just as demand reaches its inflection point.",

          "content": "Texas AG Ken Paxton is accusing Roblox of “putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children,” alleging in a lawsuit filed this week that it is “flagrantly ignoring state and federal online safety laws while deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform.” The lawsuit accuses Roblox of deceptive trade practices for misleading parents and users about its safety features, and for creating a common nuisance by harboring a space “that has become a habitual destination for child predators engaging in grooming and child sexual exploitation.” The lawsuit&#8217;s examples focus on instances of children who have been abused by predators they met via Roblox, and the activities of groups like 764 which have used online platforms to identify and blackmail victims into sexually explicit acts or self harm. According to the suit, Roblox&#8217;s parental controls push only began after a number of lawsuits, and a report released last fall by the short seller Hindenburg that said its &#8220;in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.&#8221; In August, Louisiana filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that Roblox “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive.” A couple of months later, the state of Kentucky also sued Roblox, calling it “a hunting ground for child predators.” Last month, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier subpoenaed Roblox over similar allegations. It’s not just states suing Roblox, either. Numerous families and Roblox players have also sued the platform for alleged abuse, such as the cases detailed in Texas’s lawsuit. Eric Porterfield, Senior Director of Policy Communications at Roblox, responded to the lawsuit in a statement to The Verge, saying, “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims.” He added, “We have introduced over 145 safety measures on the platform this year alone.” Roblox reported in September that it has over 111 million daily active users, many of whom are children. Earlier this year, Roblox announced plans to roll out age verification using IDs and facial scans, along with an AI system intended to “detect early signals of potential child endangerment.” It echoes similar changes on social media platforms like Discord, which also began rolling out age verification this year and has even been cited in some of the same lawsuits filed against Roblox, including one case involving a 13-year-old from Texas. Social media platforms have often successfully used Section 230 to shield themselves from liability for individual users’ actions on their platforms, however — a barrier this Roblox suit, like others against the company, will face.",

It was previously delayed from its 2025 launch window to May 26, 2026. And now again. If you have the feeling it’s been a while since the last GTA game, you’d be right. GTA V was originally released in 2013 and has been re-released multiple times since then. In fact, it’s a rare game that’s spanned PS3, PS4 and PS5. Rockstar is likely self-assured that the game will do fine. Grand Theft Auto Online, a multiplayer mode for GTA V that can also be downloaded as a standalone game, remains a hit. “We continue to supply content to GTA Online, and in fact we’ve had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it’s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And GTA V has sold more than 220 million units,” said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview with The Game Business. — Mat Smith Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox.

Apple may debut a low-cost Mac laptop in the first half of 2026. According to a Bloomberg report, it’s in early production, and Apple is testing the devices internally. The idea may be to create a rival to cheap Chromebooks and Windows PCs, nudging folks into that money-spinning ecosystem. The company is said to be making the system with casual users, students and businesses in mind. (I’d guess many of those users are paying more for MacBooks with power they’ll never really tap into.) The report suggests it’ll have a “lower-end LCD display,” and it’s expected to run on an A-series iPhone processor that would still, apparently, deliver better performance than the M1.

It’s also a very visible, notable drone maker — and flying robots understandably make folks nervous. After losing a recent lawsuit and an appeal, DJI is nearing a key December 23, 2025, deadline under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which could trigger an automatic ban. A recent FCC vote and pending legislation could also block sales and even theoretically prevent people from using already-purchased drones by cutting off radio access. DJI might have to hope a ban will create enough customer outcry to stimulate a political response in its favor. Continue reading.

          "content": "Rockstar Games has announced Grand Theft Auto VI 's launch is being delayed once again to November 19, 2026. That’s roughly a year from now. It was previously delayed from its 2025 launch window to May 26, 2026. And now again. If you have the feeling it’s been a while since the last GTA game, you’d be right. GTA V was originally released in 2013 and has been re-released multiple times since then. In fact, it’s a rare game that’s spanned PS3, PS4 and PS5. Rockstar is likely self-assured that the game will do fine. Grand Theft Auto Online, a multiplayer mode for GTA V that can also be downloaded as a standalone game, remains a hit. “We continue to supply content to GTA Online, and in fact we’ve had terrific results there. And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it’s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And GTA V has sold more than 220 million units,” said Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview with The Game Business. — Mat Smith Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox.

Apple may debut a low-cost Mac laptop in the first half of 2026. According to a Bloomberg report, it’s in early production, and Apple is testing the devices internally. The idea may be to create a rival to cheap Chromebooks and Windows PCs, nudging folks into that money-spinning ecosystem. The company is said to be making the system with casual users, students and businesses in mind. (I’d guess many of those users are paying more for MacBooks with power they’ll never really tap into.) The report suggests it’ll have a “lower-end LCD display,” and it’s expected to run on an A-series iPhone processor that would still, apparently, deliver better performance than the M1.

On Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University released a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy. The study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language. Instead of relying on subjective human judgment about whether text sounds authentic, the framework uses automated classifiers and linguistic analysis to identify specific features that distinguish machine-generated from human-authored content.Read full article Comments",

He had previously been hospitalized with an infection. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory also confirmed his passing. Watson was born in Chicago in 1928 and attained scientific fame in 1953 at 25 years old for solving the molecular structure of DNA—the genetic blueprints for life—with his colleague Francis Crick at England’s Cavendish laboratory. Their discovery heavily relied on the work of chemist and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin at King’s College in London, whose X-ray images of DNA provided critical clues to the molecule’s twisted-ladderlike architecture. One image in particular from Franklin’s lab, Photo 51, made Watson and Crick’s discovery possible. But, she was not fully credited for her contribution. The image was given to Watson and Crick without Franklin’s knowledge or consent by Maurice Wilkins, a biophysicist and colleague of Franklin.Read full article Comments",

The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups. Unit 42 says that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now. Even if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected.

The FAA also directed commercial airlines to reduce domestic flights from 40 “high impact airports” across the country in a phased approach beginning Friday. The agency said the order from the FAA’s administrator, Bryan Bedford, is aimed at addressing “safety risks and delays presented by air traffic controller staffing constraints caused by the continued lapse in appropriations.” The government considers air traffic controllers essential workers, so they remain on the job without pay until Congress passes a federal budget and President Donald Trump signs it into law. The shutdown’s effects, which affected federal workers most severely at first, are now rippling across the broader economy.Read full article Comments",

With Skigill, indie developer Achromi has taken that break-time menu and transformed it into the playing field for an intriguing Vampire Survivors-style roguelike. And while the Early Access game currently lacks the kind of deep content that will keep players coming back for a long time, it’s still a clever and engaging take on the genre that I haven’t been able to put down for long. Clear the way, I need +5 armor! Like Vampire Survivors and its many imitators, Skigill is all about navigating through waves of enemies that converge somewhat mindlessly on your position.

That’s according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, which claims that Ford’s management is “in active discussions about scrapping” the Lightning. Production had already been suspended a few weeks ago due to an aluminum shortage following a destructive fire at a supplier’s factory in New York, which Ford estimates may result in as much as $2 billion in losses to the company. While Ford told Ars it doesn’t comment on speculation on its future product plans, the automaker said that “F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the US—despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian—and delivered record sales in Q3.”Read full article Comments",

This builds on Google’s last Finance update, which added a Gemini-based chatbot. Now, Google is adding Gemini Deep Research to the site, which will allow users to ask much more complex questions. You can also ask questions about the future, backed by new betting market data sources. The update, which is rolling out over the next several weeks, will add a Deep Research option to the Finance chatbot. The company claims that with the more powerful AI, users will be able to generate “fully cited” research reports on a given topic in just a few minutes. So you can expect an experience similar to Deep Research in the Gemini app—you give it a prompt, and then you come back later to see the result. You probably won’t want to bother with Deep Research on simple queries—there are faster, easier ways to get that done. Google suggests using Deep Research on more complex things, like the doozy below.Read full article Comments",

It also has a gigantic compound that is home to Mark Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their daughters Maxima, August, and Aurelia. Their land has expanded to include 11 previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line. The Zuckerberg compound’s expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbors as early as 2016, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area’s residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025. WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. However, neighbors and separate public records confirm that the property in question belongs to the family. The names of the neighbors who were in touch with the city were also redacted.)Read full article Comments",

Blue Origin is charging NASA about $20 million for the launch on the company’s heavy-lift New Glenn rocket. A dedicated ride on any other rocket capable of the job would undoubtedly cost more. But there are trade-offs. First, there’s the question of risk. The New Glenn rocket is only making its second flight, and it hasn’t been certified by NASA or the US Space Force. Second, the schedule for ESCAPADE’s launch has been at the whim of Blue Origin, which has delayed the mission several times due to issues developing New Glenn. NASA’s interplanetary missions typically have a fixed launch period, and the agency pays providers like SpaceX and United Launch Alliance a premium to ensure the launch happens when it needs to happen. New Glenn is ready, the satellites are ready, and Blue Origin has set a launch date for Sunday, November 9. The mission will depart Earth outside of the usual interplanetary launch window, so orbital dynamics wizards came up with a unique trajectory that will get the satellites to Mars in 2027.Read full article Comments",

Since then, it has been boosting the resolution and filling in the details of an environment dominated by the most extreme gravity in the Universe. But which gravity are we talking about? Because of its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and our current inability to explain dark matter, people have proposed all sorts of variants of gravity that go beyond general relativity and clean up some of the physics’ awkwardness. It’s possible that the extreme environment near a black hole amplifies the differences among at least some of these hypotheses. So, a group of physicists decided to see whether any of those differences might be large enough that the next generation of telescopes might be able to rule out some potential replacements for relativity. Searching for subtlety Any replacement for general relativity faces an awkward challenge: General relativity does pretty well at explaining everything from the large-scale structure of the Universe to phenomena we can measure right here on Earth. So, any alternative theories would have to differ from relativity in very subtle ways that might be extremely difficult to detect.Read full article Comments",

According to a recent study, the finds suggest that for hundreds of millennia, ancient hominins relied on the same stone tool technology as an anchor while the world changed around them.

Credit: By Didier Descouens - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11291046 “An extraordinary story of cultural continuity” George Washington University archaeologist David Braun and his colleagues recently unearthed stone tools from a 2.75 million-year-old layer of Kenyan sediment at a site called Nomorotukunan. They’re classic examples of a type of tools archaeologists call Oldowan: the earliest types of sharp-edged stone tools made by hominins. The tools unearthed at Nomorotukunan are some of the oldest Olduwan tools ever found; only three other Oldowan sites in Africa date back any further than 2.6 million years ago. These hand-sized chunks of river rock, with flakes chipped off one or two sides to make sharp edges, were cutting-edge technology (not sorry) from 2.9 million years ago until about 1.7 million years ago. In technical terms, that’s what’s called a long flipping time, enough to span several hominin species and more than one genus. The last hominins to use Oldowan tools looked very different, and probably lived and behaved very differently, from the first; over this huge span of time, the stone tool technology itself changed less than the beings using it.Read full article Comments",
