          "standfirst": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Weaponized AI can dismantle patches in 72 hours — but Ivanti's kernel defense can help",
          "standfirst": "Adversaries from cybercrime gangs to nation-state cyberattack squads are fine-tuning weaponized AI with the goal of defeating new patches in 3 days or less. The quicker the attack, the more time to explore a victim’s network, exfiltrate data, install ransomware or set up reconnaissance that will last for months or years. Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks \"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they&#x27;re doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,\" Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at Ivanti told VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"They&#x27;re able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of that release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.\"This isn&#x27;t theoretical speculation. It&#x27;s the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls \"tangible evidence\" of the company&#x27;s commitment to meeting this threat head-on.At DEF CON 33 researchers from AmberWolf proved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in Zscaler, Netskope, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler&#x27;s failure to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2025-54982), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure.Why Kernel Security matters The kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware. If an attacker compromises the kernel, they&#x27;ve seized total control of a device that can scale to compromising an entire network. Any other security layer or application, platform or safeguard is immediately bypassed with attackers take control of the kernel.Nearly all operating systems rely on the concept of enforcing rings of privilege. Applications run in user mode with limited access. The kernel operates in kernel mode with complete control. When adversaries break that barrier, they’ve gained access to what many security researchers consider the holy grail of a systems and entire networks’ vulnerabilities.Ivanti&#x27;s new release directly addresses this reality. Connect Secure 25.X runs on an enterprise-grade Oracle Linux operating system with strong Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enforcement that can limit a threat actor&#x27;s abilities within the system. The solution includes Secure Boot protection, disk encryption, key management, secure factory reset, a modern secure web server, and Web Application Firewall (WAF), all designed to secure key aspects of the system and significantly deter external threats.\"In the past year, we&#x27;ve significantly advanced our Secure by Design strategy, translating our commitment into real action through substantial investments and an expanded security team,\" Riemer explained. \"This release stands as tangible evidence of our commitment. We listened to our customers, invested in both technology and talent, and modernized the security of Ivanti Connect Secure to provide the resilience and peace of mind our customers expect and deserve.\"From OS rings to Deployment Rings: A more complete defense strategyWhile operating system rings define privilege levels, modern patch management has adopted its own ring strategy to combat the 72-hour exploit window. Ring deployment provides a phased, automated patching strategy that rolls out updates incrementally: a Test Ring for core IT validation, an Early Adopter Ring for compatibility testing, and a Production Ring for enterprise-wide rollout.This approach directly addresses the speed crisis. Ring deployment achieves 99% patch success within 24 hours for up to 100,000 PCs, according to Gartner research. Ponemon Institute research shows organizations take an alarming average of 43 days to detect cyberattacks even after a patch is released.Jesse Miller, SVP and director of IT at Southstar Bank, emphasized: \"When judging how impactful something can be, you have to take everything from current events, your industry, your environment and more into the equation.\" His team uses ring deployment to reduce their attack surface as quickly as possible.Attackers aggressively exploit legacy vulnerabilities with 76% of vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware were reported between 2010 and 2019. When kernel access is at stake, every hour of delay multiplies the risk exponentially.The Kernel Dilemma centers on balancing security versus stabilityAt CrowdStrike&#x27;s FalCon conference, Chief Technology Innovation Officer Alex Ionescu laid out the problem: \"By now, it&#x27;s clear that if you want to protect against bad actors, you need to operate in the kernel. But to do that, the reliability of your machine is put at risk.\"The industry is responding with fundamental shifts:Microsoft&#x27;s WISP mandates multi-year changes for every Windows security vendorLinux embraced eBPF for safer kernel instrumentationApple&#x27;s Endpoint Security Framework enables user-mode operationAuthentication bypass happens when kernels are compromised AmberWolf researchers spent seven months analyzing ZTNA products. Zscaler failed to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2024-54982). Netskope&#x27;s authentication could be bypassed using non-revocable OrgKey values. Check Point had hard-coded SFTP keys (CVE-2025-3831).These vulnerabilities existed for months. Some vendors patched quietly without CVEs. As of August 2025, 16 months after disclosure, many organizations still used exploitable configurations.Lessons learned from compressing 3 years of kernel security into 18 months When nation-state attackers exploited Ivanti Connect Secure in January 2024, it validated Ivanti’s decision to rapidly advance its kernel-level security strategy, compressing a three-year project into just 18 months. As Riemer explained, \"We had already completed phase one of the kernel-hardening project before the attack. That allowed us to quickly pivot and accelerate our roadmap.”Key accomplishments included:Migration to 64-bit Oracle Linux: Ivanti replaced an outdated 32-bit CentOS OS with Oracle Linux 9, significantly reducing known vulnerabilities tied to legacy open-source components.Custom SELinux enforcement: Implementing strict SELinux policies initially broke a significant number of product features, requiring careful refactoring without compromising security parameters. The resulting solution now runs in permanent enforcement mode, Riemer explained. Process de-privileging and secure boot with TPM: Ivanti eliminated root privileges from critical processes and integrated TPM-based secure boot and RSA encryption, ensuring continuous integrity checks, aligning with AmberWolf’s research recommendations and findings.There were also a series of independent penetration testing initiatives, and each confirmed zero successful compromises, with threat actors typically abandoning attempts within three days. Riemer explained to VentureBeat that global intelligence community customers actively watched threat actors probe the hardened systems. \"They tried old TTPs, pivoted to web server exploits. They pretty much gave up after about three days,\" Riemer said. The decision to go kernel-level wasn&#x27;t a panic response. \"We actually had plans in place in 2023 to address this before we ever got attacked,\" Riemer said. The conversation that sealed the decision happened in Washington, DC. \"I sat down with the CIO of a federal agency, and I asked him flat out: Is there going to be a need for the U.S. government to have an L3 VPN solution on-prem in the future?\" Riemer recalled. \"His response was that there would always be a mission need for an L3 VPN on-prem type solution in order to give encrypted communication access to the warfighter.\"The future beyond kernel security includes eBPF and Behavioral MonitoringGartner&#x27;s Emerging Tech Impact Radar: Cloud Security report rates eBPF as having \"high\" mass with 1-3 years to early majority adoption. \"The use of eBPF allows for enhanced visibility and security without relying solely on kernel-level agents,\" Gartner notes.The majority of cybersecurity security vendors are investing heavily in eBPF. \"Today, almost our entire customer base runs Falcon sensor on top of eBPF,\" Ionescu said during his keynote at this year’s Fal.Con. \"We&#x27;ve been part of that journey as eBPF foundation members.\"Palo Alto Networks has also emerged as a major player in eBPF-based security, investing heavily in the technology for their Cortex XDR and Prisma Cloud platforms. This architectural shift allows Palo Alto Networks to provide deep visibility into system calls, network traffic, and process execution while maintaining system reliability.The convergence of CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and other major vendors on eBPF technology signals a fundamental transformation—providing the visibility security teams need without catastrophic failure risks.Defensive strategies that are workingPatching is often relegated to one of those tasks that gets procrastinated about because so many security teams are short-handed, facing chronic time shortages. Those are the conditions that adversaries bank on when they choose victims. It’s a sure bet that if a company is not prioritizing cybersecurity, they will be months or even years back on their patching. That’s what adversaries look for. Patterns emerge from different industries of victims and they share a common trait of procrastinating about system maintenance in general and security patterns specifically. Based on interviewing victims of breaches that started with patches sometimes years old, VentureBeat has seen the following immediate steps they take to reduce the probabilo9ty of being hit again: Automate patching immediately. Monthly cycles are obsolete. Tony Miller, Ivanti&#x27;s VP of enterprise services, confirmed ring deployment eliminates the reactive patching chaos that leaves organizations vulnerable during the critical 72-hour window.Audit kernel-level security. Ask vendors about eBPF/ESF/WISP migration plans and timelines.Layer defenses. This is table stakes for any cybersecurity strategy but critical to get right. \"Whether it was SELinux profiling, root privilege avoidance, an updated web server, or the WAF—each layer stopped attacks,\" Riemer said.Demand transparency. \"Another vendor had been attacked in November 2023. That information didn&#x27;t come available until August 2024,\" Riemer revealed. \"This is why Ivanti has been so public about transparency.\"The bottom lineKernel-level transformation isn&#x27;t optional. It&#x27;s survival when AI weaponizes vulnerabilities in three days.Ivanti Connect Secure 25.X represents what&#x27;s possible when a vendor commits fully to kernel-level security, not as a reactive measure, but as a fundamental architectural principle. Gartner&#x27;s strategic planning assumption is sobering: \"By 2030, at least 80% of enterprise Windows endpoints will still rely on hybrid endpoint protection agents, increasing the attack surface and requiring rigorous validation.\"Organizations must harden what they can now, automate immediately, and prepare for architectural upheaval. As Gartner emphasizes, combining ring deployment with integrated compensating controls including endpoint protection platforms, multifactor authentication, and network segmentation as part of a broader zero-trust framework ensures security teams can shrink exposure windows.",

          "standfirst": "We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but most of them don’t come cheap. To help you get the most value possible, we’re keeping a constant eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.This week has been a particularly fruitful time to be in the market for an Apple tablet: Amazon held its latest Prime Day sale on October 7-8, while other retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart are still running sweeping sales of their own. A number of Apple device discounts from these events are still available today, including the base iPad (A16) for $279 and a $150 drop for the iPad Air. Beyond iPads, other gadgets like the AirPods 4, MacBook Air and AirTag remain heavily discounted as well. Here are all the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. We saw the base model drop as low as $437 during Amazon's Prime Day sale this week, but this $150 discount ties the best price we've seen otherwise. Other configurations are also $150 off. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart but is otherwise the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for multitasking or just taking in movies. This discount is an all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The 8.3-inch iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. The newest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — alongside 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. You’d buy it if you want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. We saw it available for $20 less during Amazon's Prime Day sale, but this is still a decent drop from its typical going rate. Also at Best Buy. Best Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): If you don't need ANC, the standard AirPods 4 are still a good buy for those who hate the feeling of pairs that jut into their ear canal. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass response as traditional in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs of this type, and they still offer a host of Apple-friendly features. This is another all-time low. Also at Walmart, or Best Buy for $1 more. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s lowest-ever price, but it’s the biggest drop we’ve seen since July. Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart but is otherwise the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for multitasking or just taking in movies. This discount is an all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The 8.3-inch iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. The newest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — alongside 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. You’d buy it if you want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. We saw it available for $20 less during Amazon's Prime Day sale, but this is still a decent drop from its typical going rate. Also at Best Buy. Best Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): If you don't need ANC, the standard AirPods 4 are still a good buy for those who hate the feeling of pairs that jut into their ear canal. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass response as traditional in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs of this type, and they still offer a host of Apple-friendly features. This is another all-time low. Also at Walmart, or Best Buy for $1 more. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s lowest-ever price, but it’s the biggest drop we’ve seen since July. Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

          "standfirst": "Sonos’ Ace headphones didn’t get off to the best start, but the brand’s first headphones have come a long way since launch, and for $100 off when purchased directly from Sonos or Amazon, they’re well worth considering. The Ace are down to $299 from both retailers, and for that price you’re getting one of the most feature-packed pairs of noise-canceling headphones on the market right now. When the Ace arrived in the summer of 2024, we praised them for their sound quality, premium design and comfy fit, but had no choice but to ding the headphones for not launching with some of their flashiest features. But that’s no longer an issue if you pick up a pair today, as Sonos’ TrueCinema spatial audio tech now works as advertised. As a reminder, TrueCinema takes into account the dynamics of your living space when you’re using TV Audio Swap to create a virtual 3D audio system in your headphones. The idea is that you feel like you aren’t wearing them at all, which is a big claim to make, but there’s no denying that True Cinema enhances the experience of watching movies and TV shows while wearing the Ace. Sonos has also improved the Ace’s adaptive noise cancellation in updates made available since launch, while phone calls are now clearer than they were when we first reviewed the headphones. They’re still expensive at full price, but if you use other Sonos products in your home and think you’ll appreciate the Ace’s ability to swap audio output with a compatible Sonos soundbar (ideal for late-night movies when the kids are in bed), then it’s a very easy recommendation at $299.

          "standfirst": "Enterprises expanding AI deployments are hitting an invisible performance wall. The culprit? Static speculators that can&#x27;t keep up with shifting workloads.Speculators are smaller AI models that work alongside large language models during inference. They draft multiple tokens ahead, which the main model then verifies in parallel. This technique (called speculative decoding) has become essential for enterprises trying to reduce inference costs and latency. Instead of generating tokens one at a time, the system can accept multiple tokens at once, dramatically improving throughput.Together AI today announced research and a new system called ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) that aims to help enterprises overcome the challenge of static speculators. The technique provides a self-learning inference optimization capability that can help to deliver up to 400% faster inference performance than a baseline level of performance available in existing inference technologies such as vLLM.. The system addresses a critical problem: as AI workloads evolve, inference speeds degrade, even with specialized speculators in place.The company which got its start in 2023, has been focused on optimizing inference on its enterprise AI platform. Earlier this year the company raised $305 million as customer adoption and demand has grown.\"Companies we work with generally, as they scale up, they see shifting workloads, and then they don&#x27;t see as much speedup from speculative execution as before,\" Tri Dao, chief scientist at Together AI, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"These speculators generally don&#x27;t work well when their workload domain starts to shift.\"The workload drift problem no one talks aboutMost speculators in production today are \"static\" models. They&#x27;re trained once on a fixed dataset representing expected workloads, then deployed without any ability to adapt. Companies like Meta and Mistral ship pre-trained speculators alongside their main models. Inference platforms like vLLM use these static speculators to boost throughput without changing output quality.But there&#x27;s a catch. When an enterprise&#x27;s AI usage evolves the static speculator&#x27;s accuracy plummets.\"If you&#x27;re a company producing coding agents, and most of your developers have been writing in Python, all of a sudden some of them switch to writing Rust or C, then you see the speed starts to go down,\" Dao explained. \"The speculator has a mismatch between what it was trained on versus what the actual workload is.\"This workload drift represents a hidden tax on scaling AI. Enterprises either accept degraded performance or invest in retraining custom speculators. That process captures only a snapshot in time and quickly becomes outdated.How adaptive speculators work: A dual-model approachATLAS uses a dual-speculator architecture that combines stability with adaptation:The static speculator - A heavyweight model trained on broad data provides consistent baseline performance. It serves as a \"speed floor.\"The adaptive speculator - A lightweight model learns continuously from live traffic. It specializes on-the-fly to emerging domains and usage patterns.The confidence-aware controller - An orchestration layer dynamically chooses which speculator to use. It adjusts the speculation \"lookahead\" based on confidence scores.\"Before the adaptive speculator learns anything, we still have the static speculator to help provide the speed boost in the beginning,\" Ben Athiwaratkun, staff AI scientist at Together AI explained to VentureBeat. \"Once the adaptive speculator becomes more confident, then the speed grows over time.\"The technical innovation lies in balancing acceptance rate (how often the target model agrees with drafted tokens) and draft latency. As the adaptive model learns from traffic patterns, the controller relies more on the lightweight speculator and extends lookahead. This compounds performance gains.Users don&#x27;t need to tune any parameters. \"On the user side, users don&#x27;t have to turn any knobs,\" Dao said. \"On our side, we have turned these knobs for users to adjust in a configuration that gets good speedup.\"Performance that rivals custom siliconTogether AI&#x27;s testing shows ATLAS reaching 500 tokens per second on DeepSeek-V3.1 when fully adapted. More impressively, those numbers on Nvidia B200 GPUs match or exceed specialized inference chips like Groq&#x27;s custom hardware.\"The software and algorithmic improvement is able to close the gap with really specialized hardware,\" Dao said. \"We were seeing 500 tokens per second on these huge models that are even faster than some of the customized chips.\"The 400% speedup that the company claims for inference represents the cumulative effect of Together&#x27;s Turbo optimization suite. FP4 quantization delivers 80% speedup over FP8 baseline. The static Turbo Speculator adds another 80-100% gain. The adaptive system layers on top. Each optimization compounds the benefits of the others.Compared to standard inference engines like vLLM or Nvidia&#x27;s TensorRT-LLM, the improvement is substantial. Together AI benchmarks against the stronger baseline between the two for each workload before applying speculative optimizations.The memory-compute tradeoff explainedThe performance gains stem from exploiting a fundamental inefficiency in modern inference: wasted compute capacity.Dao explained that typically during inference, much of the compute power is not fully utilized.\"During inference, which is actually the dominant workload nowadays, you&#x27;re mostly using the memory subsystem,\" he said.Speculative decoding trades idle compute for reduced memory access. When a model generates one token at a time, it&#x27;s memory-bound. The GPU sits idle while waiting for memory. But when the speculator proposes five tokens and the target model verifies them simultaneously, compute utilization spikes while memory access remains roughly constant.\"The total amount of compute to generate five tokens is the same, but you only had to access memory once, instead of five times,\" Dao said.Think of it as intelligent caching for AIFor infrastructure teams familiar with traditional database optimization, adaptive speculators function like an intelligent caching layer, but with a crucial difference.Traditional caching systems like Redis or memcached require exact matches. You store the exact same query result and retrieve it when that specific query runs again. Adaptive speculators work differently.\"You can view it as an intelligent way of caching, not storing exactly, but figuring out some patterns that you see,\" Dao explained. \"Broadly, we&#x27;re observing that you&#x27;re working with similar code, or working with similar, you know, controlling compute in a similar way. We can then predict what the big model is going to say. We just get better and better at predicting that.\"Rather than storing exact responses, the system learns patterns in how the model generates tokens. It recognizes that if you&#x27;re editing Python files in a specific codebase, certain token sequences become more likely. The speculator adapts to those patterns, improving its predictions over time without requiring identical inputs.Use cases: RL training and evolving workloadsTwo enterprise scenarios particularly benefit from adaptive speculators:Reinforcement learning training: Static speculators quickly fall out of alignment as the policy evolves during training. ATLAS adapts continuously to the shifting policy distribution.Evolving workloads: As enterprises discover new AI use cases, workload composition shifts. \"Maybe they started using AI for chatbots, but then they realized, hey, it can write code, so they start shifting to code,\" Dao said. \"Or they realize these AIs can actually call tools and control computers and do accounting and things like that.\"In a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize for the specific codebase being edited. These are files not seen during training. This further increases acceptance rates and decoding speed.What it means for enterprises and the inference ecosystemATLAS is available now on Together AI&#x27;s dedicated endpoints as part of the platform at no additional cost. The company&#x27;s 800,000-plus developers (up from 450,000 in February) have access to the optimization.But the broader implications extend beyond one vendor&#x27;s product. The shift from static to adaptive optimization represents a fundamental rethinking of how inference platforms should work. As enterprises deploy AI across multiple domains, the industry will need to move beyond one-time trained models toward systems that learn and improve continuously.Together AI has historically released some of its research techniques as open source and collaborated with projects like vLLM. While the fully integrated ATLAS system is proprietary, some of the underlying techniques may eventually influence the broader inference ecosystem. For enterprises looking to lead in AI, the message is clear: adaptive algorithms on commodity hardware can match custom silicon at a fraction of the cost. As this approach matures across the industry, software optimization increasingly trumps specialized hardware.",

          "standfirst": "If you prefer open-ear AirPods but still have an older model, this deal could be worth noting. The AirPods 4 are still on sale for $89, or 30 percent off their usual price. That's also the lowest we've seen them and a sale price that's still hanging on after Prime Day earlier this week. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $120 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway. There are plenty of other Apple deals to be had at the moment, and there are a few more worthy AirPods deals we've collected below.

With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway. There are plenty of other Apple deals to be had at the moment, and there are a few more worthy AirPods deals we've collected below.

          "title": "Will updating your AI agents help or hamper their performance? Raindrop's new tool Experiments tells you",
          "standfirst": "It seems like almost every week for the last two years since ChatGPT launched, new large language models (LLMs) from rival labs or from OpenAI itself have been released. Enterprises are hard pressed to keep up with the massive pace of change, let alone understand how to adapt to it — which of these new models should they adopt, if any, to power their workflows and the custom AI agents they&#x27;re building to carry them out? Help has arrived: AI applications observability startup Raindrop has launched Experiments, a new analytics feature that the company describes as the first A/B testing suite designed specifically for enterprise AI agents — allowing companies to see and compare how updating agents to new underlying models, or changing their instructions and tool access, will impact their performance with real end users. The release extends Raindrop’s existing observability tools, giving developers and teams a way to see how their agents behave and evolve in real-world conditions.With Experiments, teams can track how changes — such as a new tool, prompt, model update, or full pipeline refactor — affect AI performance across millions of user interactions. The new feature is available now for users on Raindrop’s Pro subscription plan ($350 monthly) at raindrop.ai. A Data-Driven Lens on Agent DevelopmentRaindrop co-founder and chief technology officer Ben Hylak noted in a product announcement video (above) that Experiments helps teams see “how literally anything changed,” including tool usage, user intents, and issue rates, and to explore differences by demographic factors such as language. The goal is to make model iteration more transparent and measurable.The Experiments interface presents results visually, showing when an experiment performs better or worse than its baseline. Increases in negative signals might indicate higher task failure or partial code output, while improvements in positive signals could reflect more complete responses or better user experiences.By making this data easy to interpret, Raindrop encourages AI teams to approach agent iteration with the same rigor as modern software deployment—tracking outcomes, sharing insights, and addressing regressions before they compound.Background: From AI Observability to ExperimentationRaindrop’s launch of Experiments builds on the company’s foundation as one of the first AI-native observability platforms, designed to help enterprises monitor and understand how their generative AI systems behave in production. As VentureBeat reported earlier this year, the company — originally known as Dawn AI — emerged to address what Hylak, a former Apple human interface designer, called the “black box problem” of AI performance, helping teams catch failures “as they happen and explain to enterprises what went wrong and why.\" At the time, Hylak described how “AI products fail constantly—in ways both hilarious and terrifying,” noting that unlike traditional software, which throws clear exceptions, “AI products fail silently.” Raindrop’s original platform focused on detecting those silent failures by analyzing signals such as user feedback, task failures, refusals, and other conversational anomalies across millions of daily events.The company’s co-founders— Hylak, Alexis Gauba, and Zubin Singh Koticha — built Raindrop after encountering firsthand the difficulty of debugging AI systems in production. “We started by building AI products, not infrastructure,” Hylak told VentureBeat. “But pretty quickly, we saw that to grow anything serious, we needed tooling to understand AI behavior—and that tooling didn’t exist.”With Experiments, Raindrop extends that same mission from detecting failures to measuring improvements. The new tool transforms observability data into actionable comparisons, letting enterprises test whether changes to their models, prompts, or pipelines actually make their AI agents better—or just different.Solving the “Evals Pass, Agents Fail” ProblemTraditional evaluation frameworks, while useful for benchmarking, rarely capture the unpredictable behavior of AI agents operating in dynamic environments. As Raindrop co-founder Alexis Gauba explained in her LinkedIn announcement, “Traditional evals don’t really answer this question. They’re great unit tests, but you can’t predict your user’s actions and your agent is running for hours, calling hundreds of tools.”Gauba said the company consistently heard a common frustration from teams: “Evals pass, agents fail.”Experiments is meant to close that gap by showing what actually changes when developers ship updates to their systems. The tool enables side-by-side comparisons of models, tools, intents, or properties, surfacing measurable differences in behavior and performance.Designed for Real-World AI BehaviorIn the announcement video, Raindrop described Experiments as a way to “compare anything and measure how your agent’s behavior actually changed in production across millions of real interactions.”The platform helps users spot issues such as task failure spikes, forgetting, or new tools that trigger unexpected errors. It can also be used in reverse — starting from a known problem, such as an “agent stuck in a loop,” and tracing back to which model, tool, or flag is driving it. From there, developers can dive into detailed traces to find the root cause and ship a fix quickly.Each experiment provides a visual breakdown of metrics like tool usage frequency, error rates, conversation duration, and response length. Users can click on any comparison to access the underlying event data, giving them a clear view of how agent behavior changed over time. Shared links make it easy to collaborate with teammates or report findings.Integration, Scalability, and AccuracyAccording to Hylak, Experiments integrates directly with “the feature flag platforms companies know and love (like Statsig!)” and is designed to work seamlessly with existing telemetry and analytics pipelines. For companies without those integrations, it can still compare performance over time—such as yesterday versus today—without additional setup.Hylak said teams typically need around 2,000 users per day to produce statistically meaningful results. To ensure the accuracy of comparisons, Experiments monitors for sample size adequacy and alerts users if a test lacks enough data to draw valid conclusions.“We obsess over making sure metrics like Task Failure and User Frustration are metrics that you’d wake up an on-call engineer for,” Hylak explained. He added that teams can drill into the specific conversations or events that drive those metrics, ensuring transparency behind every aggregate number.Security and Data ProtectionRaindrop operates as a cloud-hosted platform but also offers on-premise personally identifiable information (PII) redaction for enterprises that need additional control. Hylak said the company is SOC 2 compliant and has launched a PII Guard feature that uses AI to automatically remove sensitive information from stored data. “We take protecting customer data very seriously,” he emphasized.Pricing and PlansExperiments is part of Raindrop’s Pro plan, which costs $350 per month or $0.0007 per interaction. The Pro tier also includes deep research tools, topic clustering, custom issue tracking, and semantic search capabilities.Raindrop’s Starter plan — $65 per month or $0.001 per interaction — offers core analytics including issue detection, user feedback signals, Slack alerts, and user tracking. Both plans come with a 14-day free trial.Larger organizations can opt for an Enterprise plan with custom pricing and advanced features like SSO login, custom alerts, integrations, edge-PII redaction, and priority support.Continuous Improvement for AI SystemsWith Experiments, Raindrop positions itself at the intersection of AI analytics and software observability. Its focus on “measure truth,” as stated in the product video, reflects a broader push within the industry toward accountability and transparency in AI operations.Rather than relying solely on offline benchmarks, Raindrop’s approach emphasizes real user data and contextual understanding. The company hopes this will allow AI developers to move faster, identify root causes sooner, and ship better-performing models with confidence.",

          "title": "The best smartwatches for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks. Table of contents Best smartwatches for 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Other smartwatches our experts tested Smartwatch FAQs Best smartwatches of 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Fossil Yes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please. Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Compatibility Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone. The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things. Price The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials. Battery life Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates. Communication Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now. Fitness tracking Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well. Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more. Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Music Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds. Displays Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives. You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again. NFC Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth. Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems. Other smartwatches our experts tested Apple Watch Ultra 3 The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple Watch SE 3 The Apple Watch SE 3 is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay. Amazfit Bip 6 The Amazfit Bip 6, an $80 smartwatch from Zepp Health, didn’t quite make the cut. As a fitness tracker, it’s decent, but it’s a frustrating smartwatch. For workouts, the built-in GPS tracks runs and rides without your phone and, combined with the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors, collects a good amount of data to create accurate pictures of your exertion levels, cadence and pace. It’s remarkably lightweight but doesn’t feel cheap and the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp. It’s not an always-on display, but lifting your wrist wakes it reliably. The sleep tracking data is on par with what we measured on other smartwatches and there’s even a daily readiness score that compares your sleep quality and the previous day’s exertion to estimate how physically prepared you are for the day ahead — similar to what Pixel Watches, Fitbit devices and Garmin watches offer. And since the watch battery lasts for over a week on a charge, you may be a lot more apt to wear it to bed than a watch you have to charge daily. We weren’t expecting an $80 device to be a serious Apple Watch challenger, but the Bip 6’s glitches and overly complicated interface (both on the app and on the watch itself) were disappointing. During a week of testing, I got multiple repeated notifications, even after they were deleted, along with suggestions to stand when I was actively doing chores around the house. The watch faces are not customizable, so it was hard to get the info I needed at a glance (the Zepp app has lots of paid watch faces that may have what I wanted, but I didn’t want to pay $3 for something that’s free elsewhere). Marketing details state that the Bip 6 can auto-detect workouts, including walking and bike riding. During testing, I walked once or twice per day for over one mile and went on two bike rides, but no workout was ever detected. The watch integrates with Apple Health, so I was able to see how it compares to the data my Apple Watch gathers. After a week of wearing the Bip 6, with no changes to my daily routine, I averaged 400 fewer calories burned and 2.4 fewer miles tracked each day. That was possibly the biggest disappointment of all. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter Smartwatch FAQs Is there a difference between a smartwatch and a fitness tracker? While smartwatches and fitness trackers share some similarities, they’re designed for slightly different purposes. A fitness tracker is primarily focused on health and activity tracking. It keeps tabs on your steps, heart rate, sleep and workouts, and some even offer advanced metrics like blood oxygen levels and stress tracking. Fitness trackers are generally more compact, have longer battery life and are built with activity in mind. A smartwatch, on the other hand, is like a mini smartphone on your wrist. It offers fitness tracking features, but also lets you do things like reply to texts, take calls, use apps and control smart home devices. Many smartwatches support voice assistants, mobile payments and even LTE connectivity, so you can leave your phone behind in some cases. If you mainly want health and activity tracking with long battery life, a fitness tracker is the way to go. If you want a more connected experience with extra features, a smartwatch is the better choice. How long do smartwatches last? How long a smartwatch lasts mostly depends on two things: battery life and overall durability. Smartwatch battery life varies a lot depending on the brand, features and how you use it. Basic models with e-ink displays or monochrome screens can last a week or more, while full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch usually need a charge every day or two. If you're using features like always-on display, GPS tracking or LTE connectivity, expect the battery to drain faster. Physically, a good smartwatch should last several years before you need to upgrade. Premium models with scratch-resistant glass, water resistance and strong build materials tend to hold up well over time. However, software support matters too — brands like Apple and Samsung typically provide updates for at least a few years, while some budget smartwatches may not get long-term software support. You can expect to charge most smartwatches daily or every few days, and if you take care of them, they should last 3-5 years before an upgrade is necessary. How much should you spend on a smartwatch? How much you should spend on a smartwatch depends on what features you need and how often you plan to use it. If you just want the basics — step tracking, notifications, heart rate monitoring and basic fitness tracking — you can find some solid budget-friendly options from brands like Amazfit, Fitbit and some Wear OS models. These usually have decent battery life but may lack premium features like LTE, advanced health tracking or third-party apps. In the mid-range smartwatch price bracket, you’ll find popular models like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Versa series. These offer a good mix of fitness tracking, smart features and design quality. You’ll get better build materials, more accurate sensors and app support, but battery life might still be limited to a day or two. High-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Garmin Fenix/Epix series offer advanced health tracking, rugged designs, LTE connectivity and longer software support. These are great for serious athletes, outdoor adventurers, or anyone who wants the latest and greatest features. If you just want a simple smartwatch for notifications and fitness tracking, a budget or mid-range model will do the job. But if you want a premium feel, advanced health tracking or LTE connectivity, it’s worth spending a bit more. For most people, $200 - $350 hits the best balance of features and value. Do all smartwatches have GPS? Not all smartwatches have built-in GPS. Some rely on your phone’s GPS, while others have it built-in for independent tracking. High-end and fitness-focused smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch and Garmin models have their own built-in GPS. This means they can track your runs, walks, bike rides and hikes without needing to be connected to your phone. It’s a must-have for serious athletes or anyone who wants accurate location tracking without carrying a phone. Some budget and mid-range smartwatches (like some Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have built-in GPS but can use your phone’s GPS when connected via Bluetooth. This works fine if you usually carry your phone while working out, but it’s less convenient if you prefer to leave it behind. Some very basic or budget smartwatches skip GPS entirely and rely solely on step tracking or motion sensors. These are fine for casual users who don’t need location tracking. Can you leave your phone at home and still use a smartwatch? Yes, but it depends on the smartwatch and what you want to do without your phone. If your smartwatch has LTE or cellular connectivity , you can make calls, send texts, stream music, use maps and even access apps without your phone nearby. However, you’ll need a separate data plan from your carrier, which usually comes with an extra monthly cost. Even without LTE, some smartwatches can still do plenty on their own, including track workouts and GPS routes (if they have built-in GPS), play music offline (if they support downloads from Spotify or Apple Music), may contactless payments with features like Apple Pay and Google Wallet and control smart home devices. If going phone-free is important to you, look for a smartwatch with LTE and built-in GPS for the best experience. Can a smartwatch make calls without a phone? Yes, a smartwatch can make calls without a phone — but only if it has the right features. Some smartwatches have built-in LTE connectivity, meaning they can work independently from your phone. You can make and receive calls, send texts, stream music and use apps as long as you have a mobile data plan for the watch. However, you’ll need to pay for a separate cellular plan and battery life drains faster when using LTE. If your smartwatch doesn’t have LTE, it can still make calls, but only when connected to your phone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It essentially acts as a remote speaker and microphone for your phone’s calls. Watches like the standard Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch (Wi-Fi versions) can do this. However, if your phone isn’t nearby or connected to Wi-Fi, calling won’t work. Some fitness-focused smartwatches (like certain Garmin, Fitbit and Amazfit models) don’t have a built-in speaker or microphone, so they can’t make or receive calls at all — only show notifications. If calling without a phone is a must, make sure to choose an LTE model with a built-in mic and speaker. What's the difference between an Android and Apple smartwatch? The biggest difference between Android and Apple smartwatches comes down to compatibility, features and ecosystem integration. Apple smartwatches (Apple Watch) only work with iPhones. If you have an Android phone, you can’t use an Apple Watch at all. Android smartwatches (Wear OS, Samsung Galaxy, Garmin etc.) mostly work with Android phones, but some also support iPhones with limited features. If you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best choice. If you have an Android phone, go for a Wear OS or Samsung Galaxy Watch. Apple Watch (watchOS) has the best app support with seamless integration into Apple’s ecosystem (iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay, Apple Fitness+, Siri etc.). Android smartwatches offer more variety, with access to Google services (Google Assistant, Google Wallet and Google Maps), and some support Amazon Alexa or Samsung’s Bixby. In terms of design, Apple Watch has a single design but comes in different sizes and materials. It’s sleek, but your only real customization comes from bands and watch faces. Android smartwatches, on the other hand, come in tons of styles and brands (Samsung, Google Pixel Watch, Garmin, Fossil etc.), meaning you can pick a round watch, a rugged design or a luxury-looking model. If battery life is important to you, the Apple Watch lasts about a day or two per charge, depending on usage and model. Many Android smartwatches (especially Garmin, Amazfit or Mobvoi TicWatch) last multiple days or even weeks on a single charge.

          "content": "Smartwatches do more than just track your steps and deliver phone alerts to your wrist. The best smartwatches go even further, giving you the ability to pay for a cup of coffee, take calls and connect to apps like Spotify all without whipping out your smartphone.Chances are, if you’re reading this, you already know all of the benefits of a smartwatch. You’re ready to invest, or upgrade from an aging accessory, but we wouldn’t blame you if you if you didn’t know where to start. There are dozens of smartwatches available now, including GPS running watches, fitness trackers that look like smartwatches and multi-purpose devices. Plus, you’ll want to consider factors like durability, battery life and operating system before you spend a lot of money on a new wearable. We’ve tested and reviewed most major smartwatches available today and these are our top picks. Table of contents Best smartwatches for 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Other smartwatches our experts tested Smartwatch FAQs Best smartwatches of 2025 Stylish smartwatches: Fossil and more Fossil Yes, there are still companies out there trying to make “fashionable” hybrid smartwatches. Back when wearables were novel and generally ugly, brands like Fossil, Michael Kors and Skagen found their niche in stylish smartwatches that took cues from analog timepieces. You also have the option to pick up a “hybrid” smartwatch from companies like Withings and Garmin – these devices look like classic wrist watches but incorporate some limited functionality like activity tracking and heart rate monitoring. They remain good options if you prefer that look, but thankfully, wearables made by Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and others have gotten much more attractive over the past few years. Ultimately, the only thing you can’t change after you buy a smartwatch is its case design. If you’re not into the Apple Watch’s squared-off corners, all of Samsung’s smartwatches have round cases that look a little more like a traditional watch. Most wearables are offered in a choice of colors and you can pay extra for premium materials like stainless steel for extra durability. Once you decide on a case, your band options are endless – there are dozens of first- and third-party watch straps available for most major smartwatches, and for both larger and smaller wrists, allowing you to change up your look whenever you please. Factors to consider before buying a smartwatch Compatibility Apple Watches only work with iPhones, while Wear OS devices play nice with both iOS and Android phones. Smartwatches made by Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit and others are also compatible with Android and iOS, but you’ll need to install a companion app on your smartphone. The smartwatch OS will also dictate the type and number of third-party apps you’ll have access to. Many of these aren’t useful, though, making this factor a fairly minor one in the grand scheme of things. Price The best smartwatches generally cost between $300 and $400. Compared to budget smartwatches, which cost between $100 and $250, these pricier devices have advanced operating systems, communications, music and fitness features. They also often include perks like onboard GPS tracking, music storage and NFC, AMOLED displays, and long battery life, things that budget devices generally don’t have. Some companies make specialized fitness watches: Those can easily run north of $500, and we’d only recommend them to serious athletes. Luxury smartwatches from brands like TAG Heuer and Hublot can also reach sky-high prices, but we wouldn’t endorse any of them. These devices can cost more than $1,000, and you’re usually paying for little more than a brand name and some needlessly exotic selection of build materials. Battery life Battery life remains one of our biggest complaints about smartwatches, but there’s hope as of late. You can expect two full days from Apple Watches and most Wear OS devices. Watches using the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor support extended battery modes that promise up to five days of battery life on a charge — if you’re willing to shut off most features aside from, you know, displaying the time. Other models can last five to seven days, but they usually have fewer features and lower-quality displays. Meanwhile, some fitness watches can last weeks on a single charge. If long battery life is a priority for you, it’s worth checking out the watch’s specs beforehand to see what the manufacturer estimates. Communication Any smartwatch worth considering delivers call, text and app notifications to your wrist. Call and text alerts are self explanatory, but if those mean a lot to you, consider a watch with LTE. They’re more expensive than their WiFi-only counterparts, but cellular connectivity allows the smartwatch to take and receive phone calls, and do the same with text messages, without your device nearby. As far as app alerts go, getting them delivered to your wrist will let you glance down to the watch face and see if you absolutely need to check your phone right now. Fitness tracking Activity tracking is a big reason why people turn to smartwatches. An all-purpose timepiece should function as a fitness tracker, logging your steps, calories and workouts, and most of today’s wearables have a heart rate monitor as well. Many smartwatches' fitness features include a built-in GPS, which is useful for tracking distance for runs and bike rides. Swimmers will want something water resistant, and thankfully most all-purpose devices now can withstand at least a dunk in the pool. Some smartwatches from companies like Garmin are more fitness focused than others and tend to offer more advanced features like heart-rate-variance tracking, recovery time estimation, onboard maps and more. Health tracking on smartwatches has also seen advances over the years. Both Apple and Fitbit devices can estimate blood oxygen levels and measure ECGs. But the more affordable the smartwatch, the less likely it is that it has these kinds of advanced health tracking features; if collecting those kinds of wellness metrics is important to you, you’ll have to pay for the privilege. Music Your watch can not only track your morning runs but also play music while you’re exercising. Many smartwatches let you save your music locally, so you can connect wireless earbuds via Bluetooth and listen to tunes without bringing your phone. Those that don’t have onboard storage for music usually have on-watch music controls, so you can control playback without whipping out your phone. And if your watch has LTE, local saving isn’t required — you’ll be able to stream music directly from the watch to your paired earbuds. Displays Most wearables have touchscreens and we recommend getting one that has a full-color touchscreen. Some flagships like the Apple Watch have LTPO displays, which stands for low-temperature polycrystalline oxide. These panels have faster response times and are more power efficient, resulting in a smoother experience when one interacts with the touchscreen and, in some cases, longer battery lives. You won’t see significant gains with the latter, though, because the extra battery essentially gets used up when these devices have always-on displays, as most flagship wearables do today. Some smartwatches have this feature on by default while others let you enable it via tweaked settings. This smart feature allows you to glance down at your watch to check the time, health stats or any other information you’ve set it to show on its watchface without lifting your wrist. This will no doubt affect your device’s battery life, but thankfully most always-on modes dim the display’s brightness so it’s not running at its peak unnecessarily. Cheaper devices won’t have this feature; instead, their touchscreens will automatically turn off to conserve battery life and you’ll have to intentionally check your watch to turn on the display again. NFC Many new smartwatches have NFC, letting you pay for things without your wallet using contactless payments. After saving your credit or debit card information, you can hold your smartwatch up to an NFC reader to pay for a cup of coffee on your way home from a run. Keep in mind that different watches use different payment systems: Apple Watches use Apple Pay, Wear OS devices use Google Pay, Samsung devices use Samsung Pay and so forth. Apple Pay is one of the most popular NFC payment systems, with support for multiple banks and credit cards in 72 different countries, while Samsung and Google Pay work in fewer regions. It’s also important to note that both NFC payment support varies by device as well for both Samsung and Google’s systems. Other smartwatches our experts tested Apple Watch Ultra 3 The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is probably overkill for most people, but it has a ton of extra features like extra waterproofing to track diving, an even more accurate GPS and the biggest battery of any Apple Watch to date. Apple designed it for the most rugged among us, but for your average person, it likely has more features than they'd ever need. If you’re particularly clumsy, however, its high level of durability could be a great reason to consider the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple Watch SE 3 The Apple Watch SE 3 is less feature-rich than the flagship model, but it will probably suffice for most people. We actually regard the Watch SE as the best smartwatch option for first-time buyers, or people on stricter budgets. The gap has narrowed between the SE 3 and Apple's main flagship smartwatch, too, so you won't have to make as many compromises. Garmin Forerunner 745 Garmin watches in general can be great options for the most active among us. The Garmin Forerunner 745 is an excellent GPS running watch for serious athletes or those who prize battery life above all else. When we tested it, we found it to provide accurate distance tracking, a killer 16-hour battery life with GPS turned on (up to seven days without it) and support for onboard music storage and Garmin Pay.

          "title": "Nvidia researchers boost LLMs reasoning skills by getting them to 'think' during pre-training",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a new technique that flips the script on how large language models (LLMs) learn to reason. The method, called reinforcement learning pre-training (RLP), integrates RL into the initial training phase rather than saving it for the end.This approach encourages the model to “think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining,” the researchers state in their paper. By learning to reason on plain text without needing external verifiers, models trained with RLP show significant improvements in learning complex reasoning tasks downstream, hinting at a future of more capable and adaptable AI for real-world tasks.The typical LLM training cycleTypically, large language models are first pre-trained on vast amounts of text using a \"next-token prediction\" objective, where they are given a string of text and asked to continuously guess what the next word (or token) will be. In this phase, they learn grammar, facts, and basic associations.In the later post-training phase, models usually learn complex reasoning abilities such as chain-of-thought (CoT) where a model lays out its reasoning step-by-step. This stage often involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which require specialized, curated datasets.The paper’s authors argue this sequential process does not match human comprehension, which is “not a linear token-by-token process, but rather a parallel integration of input with prior knowledge.” Existing pre-training methods lack this mechanism, hindering a model&#x27;s ability to develop deep reasoning from the start.How reinforcement learning pre-training worksRLP reframes this process by treating CoT generation as an action the model takes before predicting the next token. At each step, the model first generates an internal \"thought\" or reasoning chain. It then predicts the next word in the text, using the original context augmented with its new thought.The model receives a reward based on how much its thought improved the accuracy of its prediction compared to a baseline that didn&#x27;t generate a thought (pure next-token prediction). This reward signal is calculated automatically based on the change in probability, eliminating the need for external verifiers or human-labeled data. The reward is positive only when the generated thought helps the model better predict the next token. By rewarding thoughts based on their predictive benefit, RLP effectively teaches the model how to think usefully on the same massive, unstructured datasets used for standard pre-training. This continuous feedback loop allows the model to learn when a simple predictive guess is sufficient and when it needs to engage in deeper reasoning. As the researchers put it, “RLP is designed to shape thinking in base models by rewarding only those thoughts that measurably help next-token prediction.”This foundational approach, however, doesn&#x27;t make later fine-tuning stages obsolete. According to Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research at Nvidia and a co-author of the paper, RLP is designed to complement, not replace, these crucial steps. \"RLP isn’t meant to replace the later post-training stages like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback,\" Catanzaro told VentureBeat. \"Those stages remain crucial for refining model behavior... It’s really designed to amplify the effectiveness of those later phases by giving the model a head start.\"RLP in actionIn experiments with Qwen3-1.7B and Nemotron-Nano-12B, Nvidia’s team tested RLP across a suite of math and science reasoning benchmarks. The results show that models enhanced with RLP consistently outperformed their conventionally trained counterparts, with particularly strong gains in reasoning-heavy tasks. For an enterprise, this improved reasoning could translate to more reliable outputs in multi-step workflows like financial analysis or legal document summarization.\"RLP encourages the model during pretraining to think before it predicts, helping the model internalize a more coherent reasoning style,\" said Catanzaro. \"This could help reduce subtle logical errors, especially in longer workflows.” While stressing that RLP-trained models will still need the usual guardrails such as verification layers, human oversight, and consistency checks, Catanzaro said that “RLP gives you a stronger baseline.\"Importantly, the benefits of RLP compound instead of disappearing during subsequent fine-tuning stages (catastrophic forgetting is a common problem in LLM training, where later training stages cause the model to forget its previously learned skills and knowledge). The RLP-trained model achieved an overall score that was 7-8% higher than baselines after an identical post-training regimen. The researchers conclude that RLP “establishes robust reasoning foundations that are not washed out by downstream alignment but instead compound with post-training.”The efficiency of the technique is a key finding. On the Qwen3-1.7B model, RLP improved performance by 17% over standard continuous pre-training and also beat a similar technique called Reinforcement Pretraining via prefix-matching rewards (RPT). This advantage held even when the baseline model was trained with 35 times more data to match the computational cost, confirming the gains come from the method itself, not just more processing.Furthermore, RLP demonstrates impressive scalability and versatility, successfully extracting a reasoning signal from general-purpose web data—not just curated datasets. When applied to the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model Nemotron-Nano-12B, RLP achieved a 35% relative improvement over a heavily trained baseline while using just a tiny fraction of the data.While these results point toward a more efficient path for building powerful models, Catanzaro frames the innovation as a fundamental shift in the learning process itself, rather than an immediate solution to high training costs. \"This research is exciting because it offers a shift in how models absorb information during pretraining leading to a smarter learning process,\" he explained. \"It wouldn’t replace large-scale pretraining, but offer another creative method in building the best possible models.\"A new foundation for AI trainingUltimately, RLP points toward a future where pre-training is no longer a monolithic process of next-token prediction. Instead, the next generation of models could be built on a hybrid of objectives, creating AI that learns to think more robustly from day one. Catanzaro offers a powerful analogy to frame this shift:\"Next-token prediction teaches a model what the world looks like; reinforcement-style objectives like RLP can teach it how to think about what it’s seeing,\" he said. \"The combination of these two objectives could help models develop deeper, more structured thinking much earlier in training... Tools like RLP can build on top of that foundation, making learning more active, curious, and even more efficient.\"There is still a lot to learn about the dynamics of reinforcement learning in the pre-training phase, but what seems clear is that “introducing exploration earlier in training opens a new axis for scaling — not just in size, but in how models learn to reason,” Catanzaro said.",
          "content": "Researchers at Nvidia have developed a new technique that flips the script on how large language models (LLMs) learn to reason. The method, called reinforcement learning pre-training (RLP), integrates RL into the initial training phase rather than saving it for the end.This approach encourages the model to “think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining,” the researchers state in their paper. By learning to reason on plain text without needing external verifiers, models trained with RLP show significant improvements in learning complex reasoning tasks downstream, hinting at a future of more capable and adaptable AI for real-world tasks.The typical LLM training cycleTypically, large language models are first pre-trained on vast amounts of text using a \"next-token prediction\" objective, where they are given a string of text and asked to continuously guess what the next word (or token) will be. In this phase, they learn grammar, facts, and basic associations.In the later post-training phase, models usually learn complex reasoning abilities such as chain-of-thought (CoT) where a model lays out its reasoning step-by-step. This stage often involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which require specialized, curated datasets.The paper’s authors argue this sequential process does not match human comprehension, which is “not a linear token-by-token process, but rather a parallel integration of input with prior knowledge.” Existing pre-training methods lack this mechanism, hindering a model&#x27;s ability to develop deep reasoning from the start.How reinforcement learning pre-training worksRLP reframes this process by treating CoT generation as an action the model takes before predicting the next token. At each step, the model first generates an internal \"thought\" or reasoning chain. It then predicts the next word in the text, using the original context augmented with its new thought.The model receives a reward based on how much its thought improved the accuracy of its prediction compared to a baseline that didn&#x27;t generate a thought (pure next-token prediction). This reward signal is calculated automatically based on the change in probability, eliminating the need for external verifiers or human-labeled data. The reward is positive only when the generated thought helps the model better predict the next token. By rewarding thoughts based on their predictive benefit, RLP effectively teaches the model how to think usefully on the same massive, unstructured datasets used for standard pre-training. This continuous feedback loop allows the model to learn when a simple predictive guess is sufficient and when it needs to engage in deeper reasoning. As the researchers put it, “RLP is designed to shape thinking in base models by rewarding only those thoughts that measurably help next-token prediction.”This foundational approach, however, doesn&#x27;t make later fine-tuning stages obsolete. According to Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research at Nvidia and a co-author of the paper, RLP is designed to complement, not replace, these crucial steps. \"RLP isn’t meant to replace the later post-training stages like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback,\" Catanzaro told VentureBeat. \"Those stages remain crucial for refining model behavior... It’s really designed to amplify the effectiveness of those later phases by giving the model a head start.\"RLP in actionIn experiments with Qwen3-1.7B and Nemotron-Nano-12B, Nvidia’s team tested RLP across a suite of math and science reasoning benchmarks. The results show that models enhanced with RLP consistently outperformed their conventionally trained counterparts, with particularly strong gains in reasoning-heavy tasks. For an enterprise, this improved reasoning could translate to more reliable outputs in multi-step workflows like financial analysis or legal document summarization.\"RLP encourages the model during pretraining to think before it predicts, helping the model internalize a more coherent reasoning style,\" said Catanzaro. \"This could help reduce subtle logical errors, especially in longer workflows.” While stressing that RLP-trained models will still need the usual guardrails such as verification layers, human oversight, and consistency checks, Catanzaro said that “RLP gives you a stronger baseline.\"Importantly, the benefits of RLP compound instead of disappearing during subsequent fine-tuning stages (catastrophic forgetting is a common problem in LLM training, where later training stages cause the model to forget its previously learned skills and knowledge).

          "standfirst": "Sony just dropped a new video with Mark Cerny, and it’s a big one, with significant implications for the company’s next console and AMD’s future GPUs. Over nearly nine minutes, Cerny, who was the lead designer for the PlayStation 4 and PS5, chats with Jack Huynh, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics Group, about a series of technologies, collectively dubbed Project Amethyst, the two companies are developing together. According to Cerny, those technologies “only exist in simulations” right now, but they’re broadly designed to make the next PlayStation better at ray tracing, upscaling and other machine learning-based rendering techniques.If you know anything about AMD graphics cards, it’s that they’ve historically offered poor ray tracing performance relative to NVIDIA’s RTX GPUs. For years, AMD tried to bridge the gap with cards that outmuscled NVIDIA’s offerings with better rasterization performance, an approach the company now admits won’t work for modern, graphically intensive games. “Trying to brute force [ray-tracing] with raw power alone just doesn’t scale,” Huynh said. AMD’s solution is an entirely new architecture that combines two hardware innovations: Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores.In AMD’s older GPUs, the individual compute units are designed to work independently of one another. This approach worked great for a long time, but in modern games — dependent as they are on expensive upscaling techniques likes FSR and Sony’s own PSSR to deliver playable framerates at high resolutions — it can lead to inefficiencies. AMD is trying to solve that problem with Neural Arrays, which give the compute units a way to work together and share data between one another.According to Huynh, AMD isn’t linking an entire GPU together, as that would create a cable-management nightmare, but it is giving the silicon a way to process a “large chunk” of the screen in one go. In practice, he says that should allow the next PlayStation and AMD’s future video cards to offer a “whole new level of machine learning performance.” In turn, that will translate to better and faster upscaling performance, alongside better ray regeneration. The latter is something NVIDIA already offers with DLSS Ray Reconstruction and in games that support the technology, it translates to better-looking ray tracing effects and improved performance.As for Radiance Cores, it sound like AMD is taking another page from NVIDIA. For the uninitiated, the company’s RTX cards feature dedicated, fixed-function “RT” cores designed to accelerate the math needed to simulate light rays in real-time. Huynh says the Radiance Cores are an entirely new hardware block designed to handle ray and path tracing. “It’s a brand-new rendering approach for AMD,” he added. As a bonus, by taking on this work, the Radiance Cores will free up other parts of AMD’s new GPUs to process shaders and textures more quickly, leading to further efficiency gains.Lastly, the two companies are working on new software they’re calling Universal Compression. It builds on the PS5 and PS5 Pro’s existing Delta Color Compression technique. It will theoretically allow Sony’s next console to compress everything that goes through its graphics pipeline, reducing the amount memory bandwidth needed by the GPU and potentially reducing its power consumption.Again, I’ll note Cerny said it’s still “early days” for all the technologies he and Huynh discussed, but it’s reassuring to know Sony and AMD are thinking about how to best approach ray tracing performance and upscaling. Techniques like ray-traced global illumination can completely change the look of a game, making for a more immersive experience. If Sony and AMD can find ways to make those technologies less expensive to run, that’s a win for everyone.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-and-amd-tease-the-gpu-tech-theyre-building-for-the-next-playstation-172500942.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Although October Prime Day is over, you can still grab some of our favorite deals on brand-name SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards, including several storage solutions compatible with the Switch 2. If you've never considered adding a solid-state drive (SSD) to your PC or game console, now is a great time to start — and if you already know what a difference extra storage can make, it's still a fine time to outfit your build. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth to process huge chunks of data in parallel, getting everything done faster while keeping your device from running too hot. Some of the best products in the field are still discounted, so let's get into it. Best Prime Day microSD card deals Samsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming. SanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $120 (19 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast. Best Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 (28 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $70 (33 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $151 (28 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $418 (27 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Samsung 870 EVO SATA III Internal SSD 1TB for $95 (19 percent off): Samsung's 870 Evo series consists of some of the best entry-level SSD storage available. While it's not quite as fast as the Samsung 990s above, it still posts read and write speeds around 550MB/s, enough for a visible difference when organizing a media library. It's also way more affordable. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $240 (27 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 (19 percent off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. WD_BLACK 8TB SN850X for $544 (20 percent off): Honestly, we can't think of a lot of people who need an SSD with 8TB of storage — but if you're one of those people, this is the deal of a lifetime. The SN850X is both capacious and high-functioning, including both a heatsink and a digital dashboard you can use to monitor its performance. The smaller, cheaper versions are also marked down. Best Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $89 (23 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.

Some models focus on flagship-level power and multitasking features, while others aim to keep things compact and stylish.

A note on durability Foldable phone FAQs Best foldable phones for 2025 How we test foldable phones When evaluating new foldable phones, we consider the same general criteria as we do when we’re judging the best smartphones. Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people. For those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened. Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability Aside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IP68 designs or IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges. Most foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions). Furthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for. However, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you. Foldable phone FAQs What is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone? Foldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open. What is the disadvantage of a foldable phone? The biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use. Are foldable phones less durable than other phones? Generally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass. They're definitely more durable than they used to be, but they still require a bit more care than your average smartphone.

          "title": "Razer Blade 18 (2025) review: An 18-inch gaming laptop that does the most",
          "standfirst": "As the 7-pound Razer Blade 18 sat on my desk, its all-black unibody case and enormous 18-inch screen towering before me like the monolith from 2001, I couldn’t help but think, “Who the hell needs such a big-ass computer?” I’m sure they’re out there — the gamers with deep pockets and little regard for portability, the video editors who demand as much screen space as possible. But on the whole, the market for the Blade 18 is pretty small, especially whenRazer’s Blade 14 and 16 strike a far better balance of price, performance and weight. What the Razer Blade 18 promises, if you choose to accept its gargantuan proportions, is unbridled power and screen real estate. It’s running Intel’s new Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, a 24-core beast with a maximum speed of 5.4GHz. Its 18-inch screen can reach up to 240Hz at slightly over 4K (3,840 by 2,400 pixels) and 440Hz when downscaled to 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200). And of course, you can equip it with NVIDIA’s fastest mobile GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. Given everything under the hood, it’s honestly impressive it weighs just seven pounds, alongside a 2.1-pound power adapter. (In comparison, the similarly premium 18-inch Alienware Area 51 comes in at 9.5 pounds with a 2.2-pound power adapter.) When we last reviewed the Razer Blade 18 a few years ago, my colleague Sam Rutherford bristled at the laptop’s size, battery life and high cost (which could reach upwards of $5,000 when fully decked out). All of those points are absolutely fair, but this time around it’s easier to see what Razer is trying to do with the Blade 18: It’s simply doing the most for the people who demand it. And it’s doing so with the excellent build quality we’ve come to expect from Razer (albeit with a high $2,799 starting price). If you’re still trying to wrap your head around why an 18-inch laptop even exists, the Razer Blade 18 isn’t for you. And honestly, the concept isn’t even that farfetched. Given the move towards thinner display bezels and other refinements, laptop makers have been able to squeeze in larger screens inside of their typical case sizes. The Razer Blade 16 was a bit heavier than the Blade 15 when it launched, but now Razer has slimmed its case down considerably. The Blade 18 similarly serves as an upgrade to the old Blade 17 — and what an upgrade it is. Razer Blade 18 from the side, viewing a few ports. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget My review unit, which was equipped with that new Intel chip, an RTX 5090, 64GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD tackled Cyberpunk 2077 with all of its settings cranked without a sweat. At its native resolution, which again is a bit higher than 4K, it reached 131 fps with 4X frame generation (which uses DLSS 4’s upscaling to interpolate additional frames). That’s roughly half as fast as the desktop RTX 5090 running in 4K with the same settings — but don’t forget, that GPU alone typically runs between $2,000 to $3,000 these days. Razer charges an additional $1,400 to upgrade the Blade 18 from an RTX 5070 Ti to the 5090. (And for the record, the total cost for our fully decked out testing unit was $4,599.) Beyond frame rates, Cyberpunk 2077 simply looked great on the Blade 18’s 240Hz IPS LED display. It’s not as bright as the MiniLED screens Razer offers on the Blade 16, and it doesn’t offer the insane contrast levels of an OLED screen, but it does the job well. For the price, though, it would have been nice to see more modern screen technology. Like the Blade 16, the 18 also offers a dual-mode display, which is how it reaches those higher 440Hz refresh rates in 1080p+. Razer Blade 18 rear case Devindra Hardawar for Engadget It worked as advertised in Overwatch 2, where I played several matches well above 300fps with high quality settings. The additional visible frames are particularly helpful during fast-paced moments, where you may have the blink of an eye to take out an opponent before they headshot you. I had no doubt the Blade 18 would be fast, but I also noticed that it felt genuinely more immersive than the Blade 16 because of its more expansive display. As I leaned in during Cyberpunk 2077, Halo Infinite and Overwatch sessions, it almost felt like I was in front of a desktop setup. That’s ultimately what you’re paying for with this machine. When I opened up audio files in Audacity, I also noticed that the additional screen space simply made it easier to sift through my timelines. PCMark 10 3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme) Geekbench 6 CPU Cinebench R23 Razer Blade 18 (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, NVIDIA RTX 5090) 7,703 12,228 2,733/19,340 1,104/33,150 Razer Blade 16 (2023, Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4090) 7,364 8,667 2,713/16,245 2,024/15,620 Razer Blade 18 (2023, Intel i9-13950HX, NVIDIA RTX 4060) 7,326 5,009 2,708/12,874 1,900/15,442 When it comes to direct benchmarks, the Core Ultra 9 chip isn’t much better than Intel’s 13th-gen hardware in single-threaded tasks, and it’s sometimes best by AMD’s latest batch of hardware. Intel has made significant progress in multi-threaded tests like Geekbench 6, though, and that sort of performance makes the Blade 18 ideal for tasks like video rendering and complex games. The Blade 18 also ran remarkably cool: During a 3DMark stress test, which involved running one demo 20 times in a row, the CPU stayed at 70 degrees Celsius most of the time, with occasional spikes to 85C. During the CPU-heavy Cinebench tests, Intel’s chip jumped to 80C on average with some jumps to 90C. The GPU, meanwhile, held a steady 70C and never wavered during 3DMark benchmarks. The fans sure can get loud, though, as you’d expect for a system that’s relatively thin and needs to pump out a ton of heat. Razer Blade 18 power, Ethernet, USB 2 and USB-C ports. Razer has been building sturdy and attractive gaming laptops for well over a decade now, so it’s not a huge surprise that the Blade 18 feels incredibly solid and premium. Its keyboard has a great depth to it that feels just as good playing shooters as it does while typing, and its trackpad is wonderfully smooth and accurate. (It does get a bit overzealous when detecting multi-touch gestures, though.) Port-wise, the Blade 18 also packs in everything you’d want, including three USB Type-A 3.2 connections, one Thunderbolt 5 USB-C port, a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, 2.5Gb Ethernet and a full-sized SD card slot. Personally, if I had to choose between Razer’s current lineup, I’d go with the Blade 16 so that I could actually carry it around and occasionally use it as a productivity machine. Not so with the Blade 18 — its short two hour and 17 minute battery life (in PCMark 10’s battery benchmark) means you’ll always need to lug around its beefy power adapter. After an hour of writing this review, its battery life also dropped from fully charged to 38 percent. But really, nobody is buying this thing just to deal with spreadsheets and emails. You want ultimate power and an enormous screen? Then battery life will suffer. A transparent window along the bottom of the Razer Blade 18 Devindra Hardawar for Engadget To paraphrase The Lord of the Rings, one does not simply choose to live with an 18-inch gaming laptop — not without considering all of the conveniences you’re leaving behind. For the sickos who would dare tread that path, the Blade 18 is a solidly built powerhouse that weighs significantly less than rivals like the 18-inch Alienware Area 51. Just be prepared to pay Razer’s high price to own one.

You want ultimate power and an enormous screen? Then battery life will suffer. A transparent window along the bottom of the Razer Blade 18 Devindra Hardawar for Engadget To paraphrase The Lord of the Rings, one does not simply choose to live with an 18-inch gaming laptop — not without considering all of the conveniences you’re leaving behind. For the sickos who would dare tread that path, the Blade 18 is a solidly built powerhouse that weighs significantly less than rivals like the 18-inch Alienware Area 51. Just be prepared to pay Razer’s high price to own one.

          "standfirst": "Echelon, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end ServiceNow implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.\"The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn&#x27;t technology — it&#x27;s the time it takes to implement it,\" said Rahul Kayala, Echelon&#x27;s founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company Moveworks. \"AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed.\"The announcement signals a potential disruption to the $1.5 trillion global IT services market, where companies like Accenture, Deloitte, and Capgemini have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millionsServiceNow, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.The complexity stems from ServiceNow&#x27;s vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of \"catalog items\" — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon&#x27;s research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.\"What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins,\" the company noted in its analysis of common implementation challenges. \"A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break.\"The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: \"One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you&#x27;re weeks behind.\"How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teamsEchelon&#x27;s approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite ServiceNow experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.\"Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements,\" Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. \"The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: &#x27;I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?&#x27; The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly.\"Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months completed in six weeks using Echelon&#x27;s AI agents.What makes Echelon&#x27;s AI different from coding assistantsEchelon&#x27;s technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow&#x27;s technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.The company&#x27;s training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like Accenture and specialized ServiceNow partner Thirdera. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.The real challenge isn&#x27;t teaching AI to write code — it&#x27;s capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruptionEchelon&#x27;s emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over $10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.The startup&#x27;s approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon&#x27;s funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. \"We see the same trend with other BCV companies like Prophet Security, which automates security operations, and Crosby, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions.\"Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliabilityDespite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.\"Inertia is the biggest risk,\" Garg acknowledged. \"IT systems shouldn&#x27;t ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon.\"The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including SAP, Salesforce, and Workday — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.Echelon also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.\"They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time,\" he said. \"Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects.\"How AI agents could reshape all professional servicesEchelon&#x27;s funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon&#x27;s directly replace skilled labor at scale.The company&#x27;s approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services. Legal research, financial analysis, and technical consulting all involve similar patterns of applying specialized expertise to unique customer requirements.For enterprise customers, the promise extends beyond cost savings to strategic agility. Organizations that can rapidly implement and modify business processes gain competitive advantages in markets where customer expectations and regulatory requirements change frequently.As Kayala noted, \"This unlocks a completely different approach to business agility and competitive advantage.\"The implications extend far beyond ServiceNow implementations. If AI agents can master the intricacies of enterprise software deployment—one of the most complex and relationship-dependent areas of professional services — few knowledge work domains may remain immune to automation.The question isn&#x27;t whether AI will transform professional services, but how quickly human expertise can be converted into autonomous digital workers that never sleep, never leave for competitors, and get smarter with every project they complete.",

          "standfirst": "It's true: October Prime Day 2025 is over. But you can't expect a site like Amazon to shut down every deal — the company was built on the discount. Today, we hunted down the tech deals under $50 that are still available. While there's a lot fewer deals than there were yesterday (we counted 59 on Wednesday and just 19 today) some decent brands, like Ugreen, Anker, Lego and Roku are still in stock. Interestingly, a few of the current-model Echo smart speakers are still discounted, too, likely as a way to get the new Alexa+ into as many homes as possible. Who knows how long these sale prices will stick around. But if you miss them, don't fret, Black Friday is just around the corner. Best Prime Day tech deals under $50 still available PNY microSD Express (128GB) for $39 ($6 off with Prime): If you’ve gotten yourself a Switch 2 (or planning to gift one for the Holidays) you may want to get a couple microSD Express cards. They’re the only type that work with the new console, which you can read all about in our guide to Switch 2 storage. This is one of the cards we recommend. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $39 ($16 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $35 ($11 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. It went as low as $33 for Prime Day. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $45 ($25 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $26 ($9 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. It went for $23 during the sale. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($15 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. It sold for $27 during Prime Day. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-19-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-still-available-from-anker-roku-ugreen-and-others-120531063.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You can get Sony's WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones for $250 in a limited time deal for Amazon Prime Day. That's $150 off its launch price, $50 off its regular Amazon list price and only a cent more than its all-time low of $249.99. While the model was released a few years ago, it's still a fantastic alternative to the newer but pricier WH-1000XM6, which you can also get with a discount of $20 from Amazon right now. We gave the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 when we reviewed it and praised its redesign for providing a massive increase in comfort. When it comes to sound quality, we found its bass punchier than its predecessors'. The model provided more depth and more clarity than the WH-1000XM4, which made the listening experience more immersive. Sony doubled the the number of processors and the number of microphones that handle noise cancelation on the WH-1000XM5, as well, making it better at blocking sounds with higher frequencies like human voices. Of course, the WH-1000XM6 has better sound quality and an improved active noise cancellation technology. But with a price of $450 — currently $428 for Prime Day — it's a much bigger expense. If you don't mind getting an even older model, the Sony WH-1000XM4 is also on sale for $188. The model, released in 2020, has dated features by now compared to the newer iterations of the headphones. But Sony's WH-1000X headphones have always been some of the best, and a five-year-old model could be better than some newer devices out there.

          "content": "You can get Sony's WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones for $250 in a limited time deal for Amazon Prime Day. That's $150 off its launch price, $50 off its regular Amazon list price and only a cent more than its all-time low of $249.99. While the model was released a few years ago, it's still a fantastic alternative to the newer but pricier WH-1000XM6, which you can also get with a discount of $20 from Amazon right now. We gave the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 when we reviewed it and praised its redesign for providing a massive increase in comfort.

          "title": "The best Apple deals on MacBooks, AirPods, iPads and more following Amazon's Prime Day sale",
          "standfirst": "Amazon's latest October Prime Day sale has come and gone, but a number of Apple device deals we saw during the event are still available. If you've been waiting for a discount and don't want to hold out until Black Friday, gadgets like the AirPods 4, iPad (A16) and MacBook Air remain in stock for the lowest prices we've tracked. To make things a little easier for you, we've compiled all the best Prime Day Apple deals that are still live below. Best iPad deals still available Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): We call the Air the best Apple tablet for most people in our guide to the best iPads. While it’s a good bit more expensive than the base model, it has a handful of subtle improvements that add up in day-to-day use. Its speakers are better. Its display is more color-rich, more glare-resistant and laminated, which means there’s no “gap” between the display and the actual glass. There’s a faster chip and more RAM for gaming or more involved tasks. It also works with the Apple Pencil Pro and comfier Magic Keyboard. We saw the purple model fall as low as $437 on Prime Day, but this $150 discount matches the best price we've seen otherwise. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): The 13-inch iPad Air is exactly the same as the 11-inch model, only it has a larger and slightly brighter display. It should be nice if you’re willing to trade a little portability for more space for working or taking in movies. We gave this model a score of 89 in our review back in March. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As always, you’d buy it if you want a display you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is $20 higher than the one we saw during Prime Day, but it's still a good drop compared to buying from Apple directly. Best Mac deals still available Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isn’t a major overhaul, but it’s still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Other configs with more memory and storage are $200 off and still in stock as well. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This deal is slightly higher than the laptop’s all-time low, and it’s another discount we’ve seen plenty of times before, but it’s a decent drop from Apple’s usual list price. Again, other versions with more memory and storage are also on sale. Apple Mac mini (M4) for $500 ($99 off): This latest iteration of Apple’s tiny PC has a smaller footprint while adding a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apple’s M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — it’s $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings. Best AirPods deals still available Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): The entry-level AirPods get you tons of Apple-friendly features — from fast pairing with your iCloud devices to spatial audio to hands-free Siri — and their lightweight design should fit most ears more comfortably than previous models. They still aren’t the richest-sounding or longest-lasting pair, and they don't support wireless charging, Find My tracking or built-in volume controls. They won’t block much outside noise either. But if you’re an iPhone owner who truly hates the feeling of earphones that jut into your ear canal, they’re a worthy value with this discount, which comes within a dollar of the lowest price we’ve seen. Engadget’s Billy Steele gave the AirPods 4 a review score of 88 last year. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC for $119 ($60 off): This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support. They have the same open-style design, so the ANC isn't as effective as what you'd get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it makes the earbuds more useful in noisy areas all the same. This pair earned a score of 86 in our review, and the discount matches the lowest price we've tracked. Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weird, flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, they offer most of the conveniences of the in-ear AirPods, while their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s all-time low, but it’s the best price we’ve seen since July. Best Apple accessories deals still available Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The Pencil Pro is Apple’s premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. It’s a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that it’s not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount we’ve seen regularly over the past year, but it’s $30 off the pen’s list price. Best Apple Watch deals still available Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches last month, but Amazon is still selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: That’s just $9 off its list price, but it’s something if you’re buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If you’re in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value. Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS) for $390 ($9 off): The Series 11 is the top overall pick in our guide to the best smartwatches. It’s not as compelling as the SE 3 from a value perspective, but it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, slightly longer battery life and support for more advanced health features like hypertension alerts and an ECG app. We gave it a score of 90 in our review. Just note that there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you’re happy with your current Apple Watch. This is just a $9 discount, but we note it since the Series 11 has been on sale for less than a month, so any bit of savings are welcome. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isn’t a major discount, but since the Ultra 3 is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-apple-deals-on-macbooks-airpods-ipads-and-more-following-amazons-prime-day-sale-125644027.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The most important OpenAI announcement you probably missed at DevDay 2025",
          "standfirst": "OpenAI’s annual developer conference on Monday was a spectacle of ambitious AI product launches, from an app store for ChatGPT to a stunning video-generation API that brought creative concepts to life. But for the enterprises and technical leaders watching closely, the most consequential announcement was the quiet general availability of Codex, the company&#x27;s AI software engineer. This release signals a profound shift in how software—and by extension, modern business—is built.While other announcements captured the public’s imagination, the production-ready release of Codex, supercharged by a new specialized model and a suite of enterprise-grade tools, is the engine behind OpenAI’s entire vision. It is the tool that builds the tools, the proven agent in a world buzzing with agentic potential, and the clearest articulation of the company&#x27;s strategy to win the enterprise.The general availability of Codex moves it from a \"research preview\" to a fully supported product, complete with a new software development kit (SDK), a Slack integration, and administrative controls for security and monitoring.This transition declares that Codex is ready for mission-critical work inside the world’s largest companies.\"We think this is the best time in history to be a builder; it has never been faster to go from idea to product,\" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during the opening keynote presentation. \"Software used to take months or years to build. You saw that it can take minutes now to build with AI.\" That acceleration is not theoretical. It&#x27;s a reality born from OpenAI’s own internal use — a massive \"dogfooding\" effort that serves as the ultimate case study for enterprise customers.Inside GPT-5-Codex: The AI model that codes autonomously for hours and drives 70% productivity gainsAt the heart of the Codex upgrade is GPT-5-Codex, a version of OpenAI&#x27;s latest flagship model that has been \"purposely trained for Codex and agentic coding.\" The new model is designed to function as an autonomous teammate, moving far beyond simple code autocompletion.\"I personally like to think about it as a little bit like a human teammate,\" explained Tibo Sottiaux, an OpenAI engineer, during a technical session on Codex. \"You can pair a program with it on your computer, you can delegate to it, or as you&#x27;ll see, you can give it a job without explicit prompting.\"This new model enables \"adaptive thinking,\" allowing it to dynamically adjust the time and computational effort spent on a task based on its complexity.For simple requests, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, but for complex refactoring projects, it can work for hours.One engineer during the technical session noted, \"I&#x27;ve seen the GPT-5-Codex model work for over seven hours productively... on a marathon session.\" This capability to handle long-running, complex tasks is a significant leap beyond the simple, single-shot interactions that define most AI coding assistants.The results inside OpenAI have been dramatic. The company reported that 92% of its technical staff now uses Codex daily, and those engineers complete 70% more pull requests (a measure of code contribution) each week. Usage has surged tenfold since August. \"When we as a team see the stats, it feels great,\" Sottiaux shared. \"But even better is being at lunch with someone who then goes &#x27;Hey I use Codex all the time. Here&#x27;s a cool thing that I do with it. Do you want to hear about it?&#x27;\" How OpenAI uses Codex to build its own AI products and catch hundreds of bugs dailyPerhaps the most compelling argument for Codex’s importance is that it is the foundational layer upon which OpenAI’s other flashy announcements were built. During the DevDay event, the company showcased custom-built arcade games and a dynamic, AI-powered website for the conference itself, all developed using Codex.In one session, engineers demonstrated how they built \"Storyboard,\" a custom creative tool for the film industry, in just 48 hours during an internal hackathon. \"We decided to test Codex, our coding agent... we would send tasks to Codex in between meetings. We really easily reviewed and merged PRs into production, which Codex even allowed us to do from our phones,\" said Allison August, a solutions engineering leader at OpenAI. This reveals a critical insight: the rapid innovation showcased at DevDay is a direct result of the productivity flywheel created by Codex. The AI is a core part of the manufacturing process for all other AI products.A key enterprise-focused feature is the new, more robust code review capability. OpenAI said it \"purposely trained GPT-5-Codex to be great at ultra thorough code review,\" enabling it to explore dependencies and validate a programmer&#x27;s intent against the actual implementation to find high-quality bugs.Internally, nearly every pull request at OpenAI is now reviewed by Codex, catching hundreds of issues daily before they reach a human reviewer.\"It saves you time, you ship with more confidence,\" Sottiaux said. \"There&#x27;s nothing worse than finding a bug after we actually ship the feature.\" Why enterprise software teams are choosing Codex over GitHub Copilot for mission-critical developmentThe maturation of Codex is central to OpenAI’s broader strategy to conquer the enterprise market, a move essential to justifying its massive valuation and unprecedented compute expenditures. During a press conference, CEO Sam Altman confirmed the strategic shift.\"The models are there now, and you should expect a huge focus from us on really winning enterprises with amazing products, starting here,\" Altman said during a private press conference. OpenAI President and Co-founder Greg Brockman immediately added, \"And you can see it already with Codex, which I think has been just an incredible success and has really grown super fast.\" For technical decision-makers, the message is clear. While consumer-facing agents that book dinner reservations are still finding their footing, Codex is a proven enterprise agent delivering substantial ROI today. Companies like Cisco have already rolled out Codex to their engineering organizations, cutting code review times by 50% and reducing project timelines from weeks to days.With the new Codex SDK, companies can now embed this agentic power directly into their own custom workflows, such as automating fixes in a CI/CD pipeline or even creating self-evolving applications. During a live demo, an engineer showcased a mobile app that updated its own user interface in real-time based on a natural language prompt, all powered by the embedded Codex SDK. While the launch of an app ecosystem in ChatGPT and the breathtaking visuals of the Sora 2 API rightfully generated headlines, the general availability of Codex marks a more fundamental and immediate transformation. It is the quiet but powerful engine driving the next era of software development, turning the abstract promise of AI-driven productivity into a tangible, deployable reality for businesses today.",

OpenAI said it \"purposely trained GPT-5-Codex to be great at ultra thorough code review,\" enabling it to explore dependencies and validate a programmer&#x27;s intent against the actual implementation to find high-quality bugs.Internally, nearly every pull request at OpenAI is now reviewed by Codex, catching hundreds of issues daily before they reach a human reviewer.\"It saves you time, you ship with more confidence,\" Sottiaux said. \"There&#x27;s nothing worse than finding a bug after we actually ship the feature.\" Why enterprise software teams are choosing Codex over GitHub Copilot for mission-critical developmentThe maturation of Codex is central to OpenAI’s broader strategy to conquer the enterprise market, a move essential to justifying its massive valuation and unprecedented compute expenditures. During a press conference, CEO Sam Altman confirmed the strategic shift.\"The models are there now, and you should expect a huge focus from us on really winning enterprises with amazing products, starting here,\" Altman said during a private press conference. OpenAI President and Co-founder Greg Brockman immediately added, \"And you can see it already with Codex, which I think has been just an incredible success and has really grown super fast.\" For technical decision-makers, the message is clear. While consumer-facing agents that book dinner reservations are still finding their footing, Codex is a proven enterprise agent delivering substantial ROI today. Companies like Cisco have already rolled out Codex to their engineering organizations, cutting code review times by 50% and reducing project timelines from weeks to days.With the new Codex SDK, companies can now embed this agentic power directly into their own custom workflows, such as automating fixes in a CI/CD pipeline or even creating self-evolving applications. During a live demo, an engineer showcased a mobile app that updated its own user interface in real-time based on a natural language prompt, all powered by the embedded Codex SDK. While the launch of an app ecosystem in ChatGPT and the breathtaking visuals of the Sora 2 API rightfully generated headlines, the general availability of Codex marks a more fundamental and immediate transformation. It is the quiet but powerful engine driving the next era of software development, turning the abstract promise of AI-driven productivity into a tangible, deployable reality for businesses today.",

          "standfirst": "Presented by ZendeskZendesk powers nearly 5 billion resolutions every year for over 100,000 customers around the world, with about 20,000 of its customers (and growing) using its AI services. Zendesk is poised to generate about $200 million in AI-related revenue this year, double than some of its largest competitors, while investing $400 million dollars in R&D. Much of that research is focused on upgrading the Zendesk Resolution Platform, a complete AI-first solution for customer service, employee service, and contact center teams, announced at Relate this past March.During AI Summit, Chief Executive Officer Tom Eggemeier, along with members of the Zendesk team, took to the stage to announce several major advancements, including voice AI agents, video calling, and screen sharing for Zendesk Contact Center, and improved IT asset management, as well as the introduction of next-generation analytics, in the wake of its acquisition of HyperArc.\"We have built the only platform that is purpose-built for service and purpose-built for AI,\" Eggemeier said. \"That focus is why we lead in AI for all types of service. And it is why we can deliver what no one else can for every service need you have in your organization.\"New capabilities across use cases and companiesAt its core, the Resolution Platform powers autonomous AI agents that solve complex issues in real time, leveraging leading LLMs like GPT-5, developed in collaboration with OpenAI, and supporting Model Context Protocol (MCP) to instantly access data, which streamlines workflows and improves autonomous problem-solving. \"Since our launch in March, we’ve been building fast, focused on making AI agents smarter, more flexible, and ready for even more channels,\" said Shashi Upadhyay, president of product, engineering, and AI at Zendesk. \"And now, these AI agents are getting even better. They work across messaging, email, and now voice. They are getting smarter; able to handle multiple intents in a single message, detecting, remembering, and resolving many issues at once.\"The only platform with native built-in QA, resolutions are automatically scored down to the conversation level, so teams can track resolution quality at scale. For startups, these insights are critical. They not only show what worked, but what needs fixing before it costs them time, reputation, or growth, and importantly, fit within a startup budget. That’s because Zendesk is the only company that charges only for successful resolutions, which are verified through the industry’s longest validation window, with two layers of quality checks.Making the product CX admin a hero Zendesk demonstrated the platform’s new features by highlighting a hypothetical wearable device company’s product launch. Service leaders at every stop along the product launch journey — from design to manufacturing — manage emerging issues with the support of the upgraded Resolution Platform.For a global manufacturer that builds complex, state-of-the-art wearable tech, the pressure starts the moment a new product hits the market, tickets start pouring in, and a red-flagged backlog piles up. \"It is not a product issue, it is a resolution bottleneck,\" Upadhyay said. But, he added, \"What once took days can now be resolved instantly.\" The new Zendesk Admin Copilot is designed specifically to assist human agents, helping them spot what is not working, what to do next, and carry out changes quickly. It flags operational issues, like missing intent tags, broken internal processes, or routing conflicts that delay resolution. Copilot explains what is happening in plain language, recommends specific fixes, and with the admin’s approval, can make the changes itself. It&#x27;s grounded in live Zendesk data, like tickets, triggers, and knowledge, so every recommendation is specific, current, and based on how the service operation actually runs. Once the admin identifies the issue and implements a fix, the next step is ensuring everyone has access to the right knowledge to support it. For many organizations, that information lives outside of Zendesk. The newly launched Knowledge Connectors allows admins to pull in relevant content, like configuration guides or policy details, without needing to migrate anything so both human and AI agents have access to real-time instructions tied to the exact product version. The admin also creates a smarter feedback loop with the new Action Builder, which automatically tags, summarizes, and sends notifications to the product team through Microsoft Teams. And finally, Zendesk HyperArc will bring customers insights that combine AI and human analysis in a clear, narrative-driven view of what is happening and why, instead of siloed dashboards or static reports.\"With these innovations in place, change at the manufacturing plant cascades quickly, tickets are routed cleanly, support agents know what to say, engineering sees real signals instead of scattered anecdotes, and customers who just want the product to work get fast, reliable resolutions,\" Upadhyay said. \"The CX Admin becomes the quiet hero of the manufacturer’s story.\"Solutions for the retail CX leaderAs a CX or contact center leader for a retail company, when a must-have wearable drops, how do you deliver service for your new hit product that feels personal and consistent when your team is stretched across multiple countries, channels, and customer expectations at once? \"Intelligent automation doesn’t just streamline operations — it enhances the customer experience across borders and channels,\" said Lisa Kant, senior vice president of marketing at Zendesk. Zendesk’s Voice AI Agents are fully autonomous AI agents designed to understand natural speech, take action, and resolve issues without needing to escalate. They can verify identity, track orders, update deliveries, and answer setup questions in multiple languages, while keeping the brand experience consistent. Meanwhile, Video Calling lets a live agent spin up a video session, confirm the device is working, and walk the customer through setup or troubleshooting. And because a help center is a critical part of delivering great service, especially when scaling fast across multiple countries and languages, Zendesk built Knowledge Builder, an AI-powered tool that helps teams build and maintain their help center content automatically. It analyzes real customer conversations and turns them into localized help articles for trending issues.Giving IT leaders a strong edge When a company adopts that new product, it becomes critical to resolve issues fast, to ensure employee productivity stays strong. Available with early access in November, Zendesk&#x27;s new employee service offering, IT Asset Management (ITAM), natively integrates service and asset data together into the Zendesk service desk to help IT move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive service. Now, when a vague “tablet not working” ticket comes in, Zendesk ITAM surfaces the device details right inside the ticket, so IT knows exactly what they are dealing with. Zendesk Copilot uses that same asset data to recommend model-specific troubleshooting steps. And with Knowledge Connectors, those steps can be pulled directly from SharePoint or Confluence without migration. If the fix does not work, the IT specialist confirms in seconds that the device is under warranty and issues a replacement without any back-and-forth. With real-time visibility across every hardware asset, the IT leader can spot patterns before they become a flood of tickets, or failures at the point of care, so IT resolves issues faster and prevents problems before they happen. \"With Zendesk, IT is not just reacting to issues — it is setting the standard for how proactive employee service is delivered,\" Upadhyay said.For more on the latest Zendesk updates and improvements, and to watch a conversation with Zendesk&#x27;s special guest, co-founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, and more, watch the full videos here.

And AI companies are seeing an opportunity to bring more and more AI services into one platform, even integrating into where employees do their work. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, although still a separate window, is gradually introducing more integrations into its platform. Rivals like Google and Amazon Web Services believe they can compete with new platforms directly aiming at enterprise users who want a more streamlined AI experience. And these two new platforms are the latest volley in the race to bring enterprise AI users into one central place for their AI needs. Google and AWS are separately introducing new platforms designed for full-stack agent workflow, hoping to usher in a world where users don’t need to open other windows to access agents. Google unveiled Gemini Enterprise, a platform that Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said “brings the best of Google AI to every employee.” Meanwhile, AWS announced Quick Suite, a series of services intended to exist as a browser extension for enterprises to call on agents. Both these platforms aim to keep enterprise employees working within one ecosystem, keeping the needed context in more local storage. Quick SuiteAWS, through Bedrock, allowed enterprises to build applications and agents, test them, and then deploy them in a single space. However, Bedrock remains a backend tool. AWS is banking that organizations will want a better way to access those agents without leaving their workspace. Quick Suite will be AWS’s front-facing agentic application for enterprises. It will also be a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox and accessible on Microsoft Outlook, Word and Slack. AWS vice president for Agentic AI Swami Sivasubramanian said Quick Suite is the company’s way of “entering a new era of work,” in that it gives employees access to AI applications they like with privacy considerations and context from their enterprise data. Quick Suite connects with Adobe Analytics, SharePoint, Snowflake, Google Drive, OneDrive, Outlook, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Databricks, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. Through MCP servers, users can also access information from Atlassian, Asana, Box, Canva, PagerDuty, Workato or Zapier. The platform consists of several services users can toggle to:An agent builder accessible through a chat assistant Quick Sight to analyze and visualize dataQuick Research, which can find information and build out research reports. Users can choose to limit the search to internal or uploaded documents only or to access the internetQuick Flows to allow people to build routine tasks through simple promptsQuick Automate for more complicated workflows, where the model can begin coordinating agents and data sharing to complete tasksAWS said it orchestrates through several foundation models to power Quick Suite’s services. Gemini EnterpriseGoogle had already begun offering enterprise AI solutions, often in fragmented products. Its newest offering, Gemini Enterprise, brings together the company’s AI offerings in a single place. Products like Gemini CLI and Google Vids will be integrated and accessible through Gemini Enterprise. “By bringing all of these components together through a single interface, Gemini Enterprise transforms how teams work,” Kurian said in a blog post.It is powered by Gemini models and connects to an enterprise’s data sources. Gemini always connected to Google’s Workspace services, such as Docs and Drive, but Gemini Enterprise can now grab information from Microsoft 365 or other platforms like Salesforce. The idea behind Gemini Enterprise is to offer “a no-code workbench” for any user to surface information and orchestrate agents for automation. The platform includes pre-built agents for deep research and insights, but customers can also bring in their own or third-party agents. Administrators can manage these agents and workflows through a visual governance framework within Gemini Enterprise. Google said some customers have already begun using Gemini Enterprise, including Macquarie Bank, legal AI provider Harvey and Banco BV. Google told VentureBeat that other platforms, like Vertex AI, remain separate products. Pricing for Gemini Enterprise, both the standard and pulse editions, start at $30 per seat per month. A new pricing tier, Gemini Business, costs $21/seat per month for a year. Uninterrupted work in one placeIn many ways, enterprise AI was always going to move to this more full-stack, end-to-end environment where people access all AI tools in one place. After all, fragmented offerings and lost context turn off many employees who already have a lot on their plates. Removing the friction of moving windows and possibly losing context to what you’re working on could save people a lot more time, and make the idea of using an AI agent or chatbot more appealing. This was the reasoning behind OpenAI’s decision to create a desktop app for ChatGPT and why we see so many product announcements around integrations. But now, competitors have to offer more differentiated platforms or they risk being labeled as copycats of products most people already use. I felt the same during a Quick Suite demo, thinking it felt like ChatGPT. The battle to be the one full-stack platform for the enterprise is just beginning.

          "title": "Capturing the trillion dollar opportunity with autonomous professional services",
          "standfirst": "Presented by CertiniaEvery professional services leader knows the feeling: a pipeline full of promising deals, but a bench that’s already stretched thin. That’s because growth has always been tied to a finite supply of consultants with finite availability to work on projects. Even with strong market demand, most firms only capture 10-20% of their potential pipeline because they simply can’t staff the work fast enough. Professional Services Automation (PSA) software emerged to help optimize operations, but the core model has remained the same.Thankfully, that limitation is about to change. The proliferation of AI agents is sparking a new model — Autonomous PSA — blending human expertise with a digital workforce, all managed by a central orchestration engine. The result is a system that allows firms to capture 70-90% of demand instead of leaving it on the table. Why professional services has the biggest transformation opportunity with agentic AIMany industries will be transformed by AI agents, but perhaps none more than professional services. Understanding why requires us to explore the difference between current-state automation and future-state autonomy.Traditional automation follows pre-set rules: When X happens, do Y. It&#x27;s a logical workflow. Autonomy, on the other hand, is goal-oriented: The goal is Z. Analyze the data, select and deploy the best resources, and execute the necessary steps to achieve Z. It’s the difference between executing a workflow, and executing a full-on strategy.This distinction is key because the core operation of a professional services business is a complex strategy. Unlike a sales team managing a linear pipeline or a support team clearing a reactive queue, a services firm is constantly solving a multi-dimensional problem. The \"product\" isn&#x27;t a license or a physical item; it&#x27;s the expertise of its people, working on a diverse set of tasks, typically delivered over discrete units of time.That means the business model of a services organization contains layers of operational complexity that product-based businesses inherently get to avoid. The manual effort and guesswork involved often lead to conservative bidding on new business, underutilized experts, and reactive staffing that can put project margins and timelines at risk. Added up, this complexity represents a trillion-dollar opportunity cost for the global services economy.The orchestration engine that makes autonomous PSA possible“Autonomous PSA” describes an intelligent system designed to manage and orchestrate a blended team of human experts and their AI agent counterparts. It works by integrating a digital workforce of AI agents directly into your service delivery operations, providing a nearly limitless supply of labor for repeatable tasks, all governed by a single engine. It&#x27;s a fundamental shift from a model constrained by human supply to one amplified by digital scale.There is one enterprise software ecosystem uniquely positioned to make Autonomous PSA possible: Salesforce. Autonomous PSA emerges from the combination of three of its core technologies:The Salesforce platform as the foundation: Everything will start with a single source of truth. The Salesforce platform provides the unified data fabric for every aspect of the customer relationship. This foundation extends across the entire platform, giving the autonomous engine the complete data context it needs to function. Agentforce as the AI engine: Agentforce represents the industry’s most secure, trusted layer for building and deploying AI agents that provide digital labor. It gives organizations the power to execute complex tasks at scale, transforming AI capabilities from concept to a tangible part of the future resource pool. Salesforce-native Professional Services Automation software as the orchestration brain: The data foundation and AI engine need a command center. A Salesforce-native solution for Professional Services Automation like Certinia acts as the orchestration brain that defines the goals, rules, and workflows for the agents, deploying them alongside human resources to optimize project outcomes from sale to delivery.The keystone of this new model is the orchestration brain, akin to a control tower for the hybrid human-AI agent workforce. It’s a system built to manage an elastic supply of resources, instantly scaling delivery by pairing consultants with digital agents. Instead of scrambling with spreadsheets, staffing becomes a real-time, AI-driven allocation based on skills, availability, and project needs.The combination creates a unified platform that gives the orchestration engine the context it needs for smarter, faster decision-making across the entire project lifecycle.For executives, the impact is direct. Now empowered to overcome human capacity limits, PSOs can expand pipeline capture from a mere 10–20% to as high as 70–90%. This growth is also more profitable, as margins improve when lower-value work is offloaded to digital labor, allowing people to focus on high-value delivery. Furthermore, project timelines are accelerated, with 24/7 AI capacity shortening schedules and speeding time-to-value. Crucially, this speed and efficiency do not come at the expense of quality; human oversight remains embedded in every engagement, ensuring client trust is maintained through strong governance.Preparing your organization for autonomous PSAAdapting to Autonomous Professional Services requires leadership and foresight. For organizations ready to start, the journey begins with three key steps:Re-architect your workforce model. The traditional pyramid workforce hierarchy is shifting to a diamond structure with AI agents handling the base of repeatable work. This will create new roles like orchestration analysts and agent supervisors to manage this blended workforce. Your first move is to audit your delivery processes and identify the high-volume, low-complexity tasks primed for this new digital workforce.Invest in a native orchestration engine. An autonomous system needs a central brain. This is your PSA solution, and it must be native to your CRM platform to access real-time data across sales, service, and finance. If your project, resource, and financial data live in different systems, your priority is to unify them on a single platform to create the foundation for intelligent decision-making.Experiment, then scale. Don&#x27;t try to transform everything at once. Start by automating a single, high-friction process, like project creation from a closed-won opportunity or initial budget drafting. Proving value on a small scale builds the business case and the operational muscle for a systematic expansion across your entire services lifecycle.Model behind the trillion-dollar ppportunity Our analysis from over 2000 global professional services organizations indicates that firms today leave most of their pipeline untouched. With human capacity alone, they typically capture only 10–20% of qualified demand. By blending digital labor into the mix, that capacity can rise to 70–90%. The difference—what we call ΔR—is massive. For a large professional services organization (PSO) with a $6B pipeline, that shift alone unlocks about $3.6B in incremental revenue.And that is just the starting point. Once you add amplifiers like faster delivery (acceleration), lower delivery cost (margin gains), and access to niche expertise (skill-gap coverage), the impact multiplies. In our model, those amplifiers nearly triple the base gain, raising the total opportunity to $10 Billion per firm. Scale that across 100 of the world’s largest PSOs, and you arrive at the trillion-dollar prize.Seize the full market potentialThe idea presented here represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the economics of professional services. Firms that adopt Autonomous PSA will capture a greater share of demand, deliver faster outcomes, and free their experts to focus on what matters most: client success.The era of Autonomous Professional Services has begun. The orchestration engine is the key. How quickly will your organization seize the opportunity?The full framework and analytical model are detailed in this new white paper, Unlocking a Trillion Dollar Opportunity for Professional Services with Autonomous PSA.

          "content": "Presented by CertiniaEvery professional services leader knows the feeling: a pipeline full of promising deals, but a bench that’s already stretched thin. That’s because growth has always been tied to a finite supply of consultants with finite availability to work on projects. Even with strong market demand, most firms only capture 10-20% of their potential pipeline because they simply can’t staff the work fast enough. Professional Services Automation (PSA) software emerged to help optimize operations, but the core model has remained the same.Thankfully, that limitation is about to change. The proliferation of AI agents is sparking a new model — Autonomous PSA — blending human expertise with a digital workforce, all managed by a central orchestration engine. The result is a system that allows firms to capture 70-90% of demand instead of leaving it on the table. Why professional services has the biggest transformation opportunity with agentic AIMany industries will be transformed by AI agents, but perhaps none more than professional services. Understanding why requires us to explore the difference between current-state automation and future-state autonomy.Traditional automation follows pre-set rules: When X happens, do Y. It&#x27;s a logical workflow. Autonomy, on the other hand, is goal-oriented: The goal is Z. Analyze the data, select and deploy the best resources, and execute the necessary steps to achieve Z. It’s the difference between executing a workflow, and executing a full-on strategy.This distinction is key because the core operation of a professional services business is a complex strategy. Unlike a sales team managing a linear pipeline or a support team clearing a reactive queue, a services firm is constantly solving a multi-dimensional problem. The \"product\" isn&#x27;t a license or a physical item; it&#x27;s the expertise of its people, working on a diverse set of tasks, typically delivered over discrete units of time.That means the business model of a services organization contains layers of operational complexity that product-based businesses inherently get to avoid. The manual effort and guesswork involved often lead to conservative bidding on new business, underutilized experts, and reactive staffing that can put project margins and timelines at risk. Added up, this complexity represents a trillion-dollar opportunity cost for the global services economy.The orchestration engine that makes autonomous PSA possible“Autonomous PSA” describes an intelligent system designed to manage and orchestrate a blended team of human experts and their AI agent counterparts. It works by integrating a digital workforce of AI agents directly into your service delivery operations, providing a nearly limitless supply of labor for repeatable tasks, all governed by a single engine. It&#x27;s a fundamental shift from a model constrained by human supply to one amplified by digital scale.There is one enterprise software ecosystem uniquely positioned to make Autonomous PSA possible: Salesforce. Autonomous PSA emerges from the combination of three of its core technologies:The Salesforce platform as the foundation: Everything will start with a single source of truth. The Salesforce platform provides the unified data fabric for every aspect of the customer relationship. This foundation extends across the entire platform, giving the autonomous engine the complete data context it needs to function. Agentforce as the AI engine: Agentforce represents the industry’s most secure, trusted layer for building and deploying AI agents that provide digital labor. It gives organizations the power to execute complex tasks at scale, transforming AI capabilities from concept to a tangible part of the future resource pool. Salesforce-native Professional Services Automation software as the orchestration brain: The data foundation and AI engine need a command center. A Salesforce-native solution for Professional Services Automation like Certinia acts as the orchestration brain that defines the goals, rules, and workflows for the agents, deploying them alongside human resources to optimize project outcomes from sale to delivery.The keystone of this new model is the orchestration brain, akin to a control tower for the hybrid human-AI agent workforce. It’s a system built to manage an elastic supply of resources, instantly scaling delivery by pairing consultants with digital agents. Instead of scrambling with spreadsheets, staffing becomes a real-time, AI-driven allocation based on skills, availability, and project needs.The combination creates a unified platform that gives the orchestration engine the context it needs for smarter, faster decision-making across the entire project lifecycle.For executives, the impact is direct. Now empowered to overcome human capacity limits, PSOs can expand pipeline capture from a mere 10–20% to as high as 70–90%. This growth is also more profitable, as margins improve when lower-value work is offloaded to digital labor, allowing people to focus on high-value delivery. Furthermore, project timelines are accelerated, with 24/7 AI capacity shortening schedules and speeding time-to-value. Crucially, this speed and efficiency do not come at the expense of quality; human oversight remains embedded in every engagement, ensuring client trust is maintained through strong governance.Preparing your organization for autonomous PSAAdapting to Autonomous Professional Services requires leadership and foresight.

You can now add the UK to the list of Google's governmental worries. The country's antitrust regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has confirmed that Google has \"strategic market status,\" paving the way to more limits on how Google does business in the UK. Naturally, Google objects to this course of action. The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding \"yes.\" This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation. It simply means the company has \"substantial and entrenched market power\" in one or more areas under the purview of the CMA. Specifically, the agency has found that Google is dominant in search and search advertising, holding a greater than 90 percent share of Internet searches in the UK.Read full article Comments",

It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo (Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a Wonder Man miniseries makes sense.Read full article Comments",

Workers collect dead leaves, wood, and grass to stack them in underground fungus gardens called combs. There, the fungi break down the tough plant fibers, making them accessible for the termites in an elaborate form of symbiotic agriculture. Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices. Going blind Termites do not look like particularly good gardeners at first glance. They are effectively blind, which is not that surprising considering they spend most of their life in complete darkness working in endless corridors of their mounds. But termites make up for their lack of sight with other senses. \"They can detect the environment based on advanced olfactory reception and touch, and I think this is what they use to identify the weeds in their gardens,\" Raychoudhury says. To learn how termites react once they detect a weed infestation, his team collected some Odontotermes obesus and challenged them with different gardening problems.Read full article Comments",

Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to \"brute force that with raw power alone,\" Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind AMD's FSR upscaling technology and Sony's similar PSSR system.Read full article Comments",

You haven’t heard of this earthquake; even if you had been living in Calipatria, you wouldn’t have felt anything. It was magnitude -0.53, about the same amount of shaking as a truck passing by. Still, this earthquake is notable, not because it was large but because it was small—and yet we know about it. Over the past seven years, AI tools based on computer imaging have almost completely automated one of the fundamental tasks of seismology: detecting earthquakes. What used to be the task of human analysts—and later, simpler computer programs—can now be done automatically and quickly by machine-learning tools. These machine-learning tools can detect smaller earthquakes than human analysts, especially in noisy environments like cities. Earthquakes give valuable information about the composition of the Earth and what hazards might occur in the future.Read full article Comments",

That means someone tucking certain documents away inside training data could potentially manipulate how the LLM responds to prompts, although the finding comes with significant caveats. The research involved training AI language models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters on datasets scaled appropriately for their size. Despite larger models processing over 20 times more total training data, all models learned the same backdoor behavior after encountering roughly the same small number of malicious examples.Read full article Comments",

On the right tires, it could show a VW Golf GTI a thing or two, and while it might have been slow-charging, it could still be a decent road-tripper. All of this helped the Bolt become General Motors' best-selling EV, at least until its used-to-be-called Ultium platform got up and running. And that's despite a costly recall that required replacing batteries in tens of thousands of Bolts because of some badly folded cells. But GM had other plans for the Bolt's factory, and in 2023, it announced its impending death. The reaction from EV enthusiasts, and Bolt owners in particular, was so overwhelmingly negative that just a few months later, GM CEO Mary Barra backtracked, promising to bring the Bolt back, this time with a don't-call-it-Ultium-anymore battery.Read full article Comments",

The September 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws. Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement.

Per the official premise: A century before the events of Game of Thrones, two unlikely heroes wandered Westeros: a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends. Peter Claffey co-stars as Ser Duncan the Tall, aka a hedge knight named \"Dunk,\" along with Dexter Sol Ansell as Prince Aegon Targaryen, aka \"Egg,\" a child prince and Dunk's squire. The main cast also includes Finn Bennett as Egg's older brother, Prince Aerion \"Brightflame\" Targaryen; Bertie Carvel as Egg's uncle, Prince Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne; Tanzyn Crawford as a Dornish puppeteer named Tanselle; Daniel Ings as Ser Lyonel \"Laughing Storm\" Baratheon, heir to House Baratheon; and Sam Spruell as Prince Maekar Targaryen, Egg's father.Read full article Comments",

There were even external cheat devices that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended. While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix announced that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade would include new \"streamlined progression\" features. As the name implies, the new options menu will give players the opportunity to blaze through the game with infinite health, magic, and money, quicker leveling, maximum damage attacks, and more. \"Constant Max HP\" is a funny way to spell and pronounce \"god mode.\" Credit: Reddit / Square Enix While some responded negatively to what they derisively called a \"cheat mode,\" director Naoki Hamaguchi defended the new options in a recent interview with Automaton. \"Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far,\" he said. \"I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content.

          "content": "An October meeting of a key federal vaccine advisory committee has been canceled without explanation, sparing the evidence-based childhood vaccination schedule from more erosion—at least for now. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning to meet on October 22 and 23, which would have been the committee's fourth meeting this year. But the meeting schedule was updated in the past week to remove those dates and replace them with \"2025 meeting, TBD.\" Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to ask why the meeting was canceled. HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard offered no explanation, only saying that the \"official meeting dates and agenda items will be posted on the website once finalized.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A few weeks ago, Google told US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) that it would allow creators banned for COVID and election misinformation to rejoin the platform. It didn't offer many details in the letter, but now YouTube has explained the restoration process. YouTube's \"second chances\" are actually more expansive than the letter made it seem. Going forward, almost anyone banned from YouTube will have an opportunity to request a new channel. The company doesn't guarantee approval, but you can expect to see plenty of banned creators back on Google's video platform in the coming months. YouTube will now allow banned creator to request reinstatement, but this is separate from appealing a ban. If a channel is banned, creators continue to have the option of appealing the ban. If successful, their channel comes back as if nothing happened. After one year, creators will now have the \"second chance\" option. \"We know many terminated creators deserve a second chance,\" the blog post reads, noting that YouTube itself doesn't always get things right the first time. The option for getting a new channel will appear in YouTube Studio on the desktop, and Google expects to begin sending out these notices in the coming months. However, anyone terminated for copyright violations is out of luck—Google does not forgive such infringement as easily as it does claiming that COVID is a hoax.Read full article Comments",
